cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:04:44	ChristineG-ckak	I have 2 questions, and I apologize if they are already addressed elsewhere.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:04:56	ChristineG-ckak	I have not had a chance to review all of your chat transcripts.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:05:43	BridgetA-iiai	Oh, and also cleaning equipment afterward.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:06:05	ChristineG-ckak	Yes, that is one of my questions - how do you clean your equipment, and how do you use the

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:07:23	deedee-ogag	OK, for cleaning what I recommend is to rinse your system out with very warm soapy water, and then rinse.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:08:34	deedee-ogag	You can disinfect periodically with about 15-20 drops in your system and let soak for 3 hours or so, or you could just disinfect the part that goes into your body by putting the colon tube or nozzle into a basin, etc., with about 15-20 drops of 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:08:46	deedee-ogag	I would use about 5-8 drops of that in a basin or bag full of water.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:09:06	ChristineG-ckak	Excellent, thanks!
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:09:52	ChristineG-ckak	My next question is about implants that use oil - what is the best delivery system for these? I would not want to put oil in the enema tubes for fear I would never be able to clean them out.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:10:04	deedee-ogag	Bridget, do you run water through your system first a bit before putting it into your body?  And what kind of system do you currently use?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:10:29	screaming onion-woap	Is there anything that is available to shrink swollen hemorrhoids?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:11:00	BridgetA-iiai	I usually just rinse tubes in running water in the sink and now there is something dark growing in the tubes.  I have the silicone tube and long insert for inserting into the colon.  Do I need to throw away or can they be salvaged (cleaned)?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:11:59	deedee-ogag	Yes, screaming onion - S.O. for short.  You can use our

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:13:10	deedee-ogag	Bridget, it is hard to get the mold out once it is in there because I do not advise bleach, but you can certainly try

I tell people to blow air through their hoses or colon tubes with a hair dryer, and then hang dry.  This helps to get them completely dry before storing.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:13:57	BridgetA-iiai	Okay, thanks.  I do 2 coffee enemas daily.  I should soak after each use?

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:14:43	BridgetA-iiai	Forces of Nature is the maker.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:15:43	deedee-ogag	Bridget, you could just soak once at the end of the day.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:16:57	ChristineG-ckak	Thanks!
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:17:14	deedee-ogag	I am not real familiar with that product.  Is it completely natural?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:17:37	BridgetA-iiai	Sounds good.  I need to order a couple more tubes then and keep the oil from the coffee cleaned off.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:18:32	BridgetA-iiai	Yes, its natural.  The practitioner who recommended to me had it tested in a lab for metals, purity, etc., and it's good.  You and Kristina may want to stock.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:18:50	deedee-ogag	Yes, I would use a separate tube for coffee and for oil if you use both.  This will help prevent build-up of particles from the coffee, etc.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:19:13	deedee-ogag	Thanks for the info, Bridget.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:20:00	ChristineG-ckak	Does coffee normally affect the tubes if you only take coffee enemas, say, once a week? or is it good practice to have a different tube/bag for each enema type?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:20:41	deedee-ogag	It has the same idea as the essential oil blends I make up, it looks like.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:21:28	screaming onion-woap	What our the essential oils that you recommend or should I say how do I order them and by what name?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:22:30	BridgetA-iiai	What about air, Deedee?  How do I keep the air out of the tube when taking? I insert after coffee fills the insert tube but the silicone tube does not fill completely and thus air goes through.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:23:40	deedee-ogag	S.O., I use a blend of cypress, myrrh, lemon, basil, peppermint, and sometimes helichrysum and/or spikenard if I have them available.  You can just call the office and ask me for a blend of essential oils for hemorrhoids.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:23:57	deedee-ogag	You can apply it topically, or put it in a suppository.  I have a

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:24:55	Carl W-ogag	Thank you, DeeDee.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:25:44	deedee-ogag	Bridget, unfortunately it is almost impossible to prevent just a little air from entering the colon when using a colon tube.  Usually, people don't even notice it.  Does it really give you problems?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:27:51	deedee-ogag	If anyone is thinking about doing a digestive/liver cleanse this month, I highly recommned our

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:28:15	ChristineG-ckak	Very good idea.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:28:19	BridgetA-iiai	Maybe there are already gases present in colon,  and yes, wherever it's from, it's uncomfortable and, obviously, I'm attempting to get rid of the gas.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:28:50	BridgetA-iiai	I just did a liver/gallbladder flush.  I highly recommend like crazy.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:29:53	deedee-ogag	Yes, many times there is already gas in the colon, and introducing water can build up a lot of pressure.  Could you do a small enema to start, then sit and relieve the water and gas, and then continue with more water after you have done that?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:30:03	deedee-ogag	Rub your colon when you do this also, to push the gas out.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:30:56	deedee-ogag	Did you feel well when doing that, Bridget?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:31:00	BridgetA-iiai	Yes, I can try those.  Thanks for the suggestions.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:31:32	screaming onion-woap	Back again. What esential oils do I order for swollen hemorrhoids?

The thing is that I have had a clean diet and habits for many years.  I was surprised at the garbage that came out and that was only the first one.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:32:12	BridgetA-iiai	Stones of all types and tons of mucus.

I use cypress, myrrh, lemon, basil, peppermint, and vsometimes helichrysum and/or spikenard if I have them available.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:35:43	deedee-ogag	S.O.,   do you need it again?

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:40:24	Carl W-ogag	OK, thanks. I am not sure if they are lowering my BP yet, since I havn't been taking them very long.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:40:26	deedee-ogag	For example, tissue damage may be healed by the essential oils more quickly and visibly, but internal issues can take a while and may need continuous support. Being able to measure the sucess does make it easier to know how effective it is, though.

I was getting up to go to the bathroom about 4 or 5 times per night. Now, I only get up about 1 or 2 times per night. I am 73 years old. I believe that the essential oils made the difference.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:46:40	deedee-ogag	Essential oils were used so much in ancient times to heal everything.  We have really gotten away from their healing power, but I think we are bringing it back.  People are so sick of drugs, surgeries, etc., and are looking for more natural cures.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc	Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat	2012-1-4	13:46:45	deedee-ogag	Welcome, James.

An implant should be done on a clean colon.  They are usually held longer (coffee for 15 minutes, or probiotics, oils, etc., for as long as you can).  These are usually healing substances that you want absorbed into your system.

Some people do daily enemas and implants for healing (illness, cancer, acute issues, etc.), and some people do them for maintenance or occasional cleaning out.  I try to do them about once per month, or so.

We do want to do some things that will help the body remove it before it does create a problem.

They do tell you to eat yogurt after taking antibiotics, so they kind of get it, though usually yogurt is not enough to restore all that was killed by the antibiotics.

There is just no money in it for them, so we have to do all of our own studies and documentation on what works with our clients and then share that info.  
e5621233864a0c692e470cf04bedd4d56b5c666e	Full Body Cleanse Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-28	13:41:50	michal-ogag	I planted ginkgo trees and make almost daily tea.

I see so many people that have first gone the medical route and have not found answers, so they are now trying the natural approach.

His question was  if anyone in the group has a post-workout regime for enemas to rehydrate the body after the workout.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:10:18	Joseph-ogag	Sore legs, low back pain, and hip pain and inflammation in my hands, just from sports and working out and not stretching as I should.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:14:13	Joseph-ogag	See, that makes sense, plus the blend you made for me helped with my allergies and smells wonderful!

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:16:33	cwenger-lhah	I have. It has been a really long time since I have had the flu. I never take flu shots.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:16:36	deedee-ogag	, we will be so much farther ahead than those who wait to treat just the symptoms once they get sick.

It is such a personal choice and everyone has their own reasons for doing or not doing it. It is good to get both perspectives, though.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:19:13	cwenger-lhah	It is a miserable rainy day as it was yesterday.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:19:18	deedee-ogag	Joseph, do you get pain and stiffness at night in bed also?
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:19:32	Joseph-ogag	Cloudy and cold here  in Chicago.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:20:20	deedee-ogag	Yes, asthma does make it a little more complicated.  Have you been able to decrease your asthma symptoms with enemas and natural approaches to your health?
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:21:50	deedee-ogag	Joseph, you know what really works well for me, especially in the colder months?  I make this wonderful heating bag that I heat in the microwave and then take to bed with me or use when I am watching TV, etc.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:22:27	Joseph-ogag	Oh yes, I've reduced symptoms mostly with trying to stay active. I use enemas when I feel a cold coming on.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:22:39	deedee-ogag	I put some essential oils on the sore spots, put the heating bag on, and it takes the pain  away so well. It is amazing!  I use this on my stomach for stomach aches as well.  I could make you one up if you'd like.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:22:47	Joseph-ogag	That's a great idea. DeeDee. Thank you. I will do that tonight when I get home from work.

It heats well and holds its heat.  It can also be put into the freezer for when you need a cold pack.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-12-7	13:38:50	deedee-ogag	No, that time frame is fine.  Do you know how long you will do that?

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:09:09	kristina-iiai	One subject I'd like to talk about tonight is

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:11:44	kristina-iiai	Constipation is hard on us. In the U.S., laxatives and stool softeners are the two biggest selling medications, 2nd only to pain relievers. Constipation is quite common in our modern world for people of all ages.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:12:51	randyu-ogag	I take Benefiber tabs every day; this helps; drink water; exercise.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:12:58	kristina-iiai	So is colon cancer. In fact, colon cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the United States. Many scientific studies have shown that there is an increased risk of colon cancer in people who are chronically constipated.  The connection between bowel disease and constipation seems to be related to the fact that constipation dramatically increases what is called the bowel transit time, or the time that it takes food to go from the mouth, through the digestive system and out as stool as a so called "bowel movement."
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:13:07	randyu-ogag	Some meds can help too.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:13:33	kristina-iiai	How often do you take 
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:14:03	kristina-iiai	The National Institute of Health reports that the "normal" range of bowel movements in a week ranges from 3 to 21.  This range shows just how extremely constipated many of us are.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:14:10	randyu-ogag	Occasionally not very often; only if really bad.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:14:28	kristina-iiai	At the extreme ends of this "normal range" you have bowel transit times ranging from 8 to 56 hours! Among most natural health practitioners, it is felt that the optimal bowel transit time is between 12 and 18 hours.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:14:47	kristina-iiai	Slow bowel transit times raise the risk of colon diseases and contribute to health problems in part by increasing the amount of time that the colon content is available for re-absorption into the body.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:16:18	kristina-iiai	Benefiber is wheat dextrin so I wouldn't recommend it generally.

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:19:41	kristina-iiai	So, dextrin is a hydrolyzed starch made from various starches such as potato, corn, tapioca, rice, arrowroot or wheat. Wheat starch is a byproduct from extracting gluten from wheat. The wheat starch is sprayed with acid while being agitated and then suspended in water by the acids or enzymes. After maturing, the wheat starch is dried in a roaster where it is continually heated and stirred. The converted dextrin is then taken from the roaster and cooled. It is humidified before packing to keep the dextrin from getting lumpy or foaming. Heating times and acids vary depending upon the manufacturer and the final product usage.

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:21:43	randyu-ogag	What about my question on Fleets?
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:21:54	Larry-rfaf	I have another probiotic question.  Since I'm taking an oral probiotic in the morning and evening, can the use of a probiotic implant be excessive?

Wheat dextrin is in fact a by-product of extracting the gluten from wheat but complete extraction is not guaranteed. Individuals who are gluten-intolerant should avoid wheat dextrin.

It seems like a product works in the beginning (fiber powders, magnesium citrate, cape aloe, other herbs) but eventually they stop working.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599	Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-11-9	20:26:40	kristina-iiai	That is a very common experience, Joan, because those products often don't get at the cause of the constipation.

The longer food and microbial waste sit in contact with the colon wall the more opportunity there is for stagnation, purification and re-absorption of these wastes. It is also known that stool often contains many carcinogenic materials that when remain in contact with the colon wall promote cancer of the colon.

I use only 10 to 12 ounces of water with H2O2.

I think they are fine to use when necessary - when in a pinch.

Chi Nei Tsang involves the application of Chi-Kung in the manual treatment of the viscera (Nei-Tsang) and the deepest internal structures of the body.

The colon absorbs the healing oils into the system and they work on whatever health problem you are having.  They also work well on the skin, orally, and as aromatherapy.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:25:27	deedee-ogag	Renae, first I would do a cleansing enema using

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:28:09	deedee-ogag	Larry, the one we use is

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:28:35	Larry-rfaf	Thanks.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:29:44	Larry-rfaf	FYI on the salt... I had to cut back 50% as I was starting to get headaches with the standard amount.  Don't know why, but it worked.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:29:47	Charla D.-fjaj	I have been buying coconut milk and drinking it.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:31:01	deedee-ogag	Charla, coconut milk is excellent.  So is the water and the oil.  You can't go wrong with it.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:31:03	Charla D.-fjaj	I didn't get one last year because of a clinic I went to last year.

We just want you to have all the info and be able to make a knowledgeable decision for yourself.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:32:23	Larry-rfaf	I got the flu shot but it does take a period of time after the shot to fully develop protection.  Even though I believe in the shot, I have a friend with a very bad experience from the shot.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:33:12	Charla D.-fjaj	Always seems when my system is slightly toxic that water doesn't taste that great or I have to force myself to stay with it and not drink other things.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:33:59	Larry-rfaf	He's in his 80's and was paralyzed in all 4 limbs for several days.  He now has a long road of PT to recover.  Now he's developed a massive dose of shingles.

You could also add a little Stevia to it to make it taste sweeter.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:34:44	randyu-ogag	Signing off now.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:35:39	deedee-ogag	Adding in one of the citrus oils makes it taste great and gives you nutrients too.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:35:43	Charla D.-fjaj	Really thanks, Stu.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:36:06	Charla D.-fjaj	Is that citrus essential oil?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:36:08	deedee-ogag	Yes, definitely use filtered or spring water - no tap water.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:36:40	deedee-ogag	Yes, we use

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:38:00	stu k-rfaf	I have the same problem.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:38:05	Maryam-ogag	Is there a specific topic being covered today?

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:39:24	deedee-ogag	Charla, yes, definitely!  Pills for acid reflux actually inhibit digestion and create more digestive issues down the road.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:39:46	deedee-ogag	It is better to talk one-on-one about everything so I can make a better recommendation, but I would probably get you on enzymes,

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:41:35	Charla D.-fjaj	Well, I do muscle testing with the two gals off and on

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:42:50	deedee-ogag	OK, great.

The kidneys, or at least one of them, need to be in good working order because of the fluids that may be absorbed and eliminated during the process.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:52:24	deedee-ogag	Maryam, some essentail oils that could be beneficial to the kidney are juniper, geranium, grapefruit, and lemon.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:58:28	Charla D.-fjaj	What do you do when your whole body feels really dry and you drink and it still seems to feel that way?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:58:52	deedee-ogag	Yes, the eating plan and the cleansing part would be fine.  I think I'd like to evaluate before the fasting part, though. 
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	13:59:07	Charla D.-fjaj	I have not ever done the fasting part

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	14:00:32	Charla D.-fjaj	I use the calm formula.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db	Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-10-26	14:00:46	Charla D.-fjaj	What is your reacted magnesium? Is it better?

I am impressed that Rick drinks all of that juice every day!  I tried that for a long time but found green smoothies to be better for me.  The only dilemma I have with Dr. Walker's books (they're GREAT!) is that he recommends drinking distilled water.

Once enough water is in the colon, you then expel it, along with the resulting waste, into the toilet. You then repeat the process one or two more times.

You want to take in as much as one gallon of water during one of the enemas in a series and you want to take three in a row and you want to use an essential oil in the second enema.

Assisting the water to easily leave the colon is another function of the essential oil. Also, use a high quality sea salt, like

I find colonics easier because I don't have to keep getting up.  I do hold the water in during a colonic but am concerned putting too much in during an enema that doesn't come out as fast.

Price, who studied the diets of fourteen traditional societies during the 1930s and 1940s. His goal was to understand what makes human beings healthy and what allows them to have perfect teeth. The food Kristina recommends to readers are the traditional foods that gave health to the populations that Price researched. And, the diet is gluten-free!

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:17:54	deedee-ogag	so a clean colon will assist with the detoxifiying process of the body trying to process the hormones more efficiently.  Does that kind of answer your question?

With the diets that we have and the toxic exposure, plus the fact that we don't all have 2 - 3 bowel movements a day, means that our colons need some help just like our teeth need to be cleaned periodically.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:19:21	deedee-ogag	You were thinking correctly, Susan!

The Vit-Ra-Tox is harder for some to do because it is a 5 to 7 day fast.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:26:58	deedee-ogag	Core Restore also teaches people how to eat more healthy since it gives you categories and types of foods to eat that can be carried over after the cleanse.

I also used DeeDee's recommendation for the coconut oil suppositories.  I had a very serious infection problem from a spider bite and was on massive antibiotics.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:33:53	Susan B.-iiai	I did once and was very sick afterwards. I'd rather take my chances now!

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:36:08	deedee-ogag	Larry, I think that is the case with some people. They have always gotten them and feel safer getting them - I feel the same way - only opposite!
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:36:36	Susan B.-iiai	Well, I've done part of the above. I have no income and very limited resources so I did a hair analysis, cortisol panel, and just one estrogen measurement. Waiting for the results back from you folks any day now...
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:37:41	deedee-ogag	I have also heard of people having a reaction to the shot and feeling like they actually get the flu after they have gotten the shot  - I just think we do not know enough about all of the situations surrounding the vaccine.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:46:11	Andrea B.-fjaj	No, constipated no, but some gas.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:46:58	Larry-rfaf	After much use, I've noticed a white deposit forming on the inside of my silicone hose.  Does this serve to inhibit bacteria growth or should I be concerned about cleaning it out?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:47:23	deedee-ogag	Can you pinpoint what causes the gas for you?  Does it occur constantly and is it really foul-smelling or uncomfortable?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:48:18	deedee-ogag	Larry, I am not sure what caused that.  Is it salt or mineral deposit, or what does it look like?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:48:45	Andrea B.-fjaj	When I get up very early in the morning.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:50:56	Larry-rfaf	It could be salt or soap? I do rinse very well after use and have soaked it in a weak bleach solution.  It will come out using mechanical means but it's a lot of work.  It's a light white coating.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:52:07	deedee-ogag	It is probably mineral deposit - maybe soap residue, and as long as you disinfect (don't use bleach!), it should be fine.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:53:57	Andrea B.-fjaj	I don't eat before bed.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:55:51	deedee-ogag	I forgive you, Larry. You have a pass this time.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:57:10	deedee-ogag	You only want to eat a small amount of protein which actually stabilizes blood sugar and helps the adrenals.  Just a small amount.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:57:25	Joseph-ogag	But you got your, protein Larry. lol

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:58:17	Andrea B.-fjaj	OK, DeeDee, but a colonic session is recommended?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:59:24	deedee-ogag	Yes, a colonic would be good.  You could then see what is going on and hopefully the colon therapist would be able to give you some good feedback on what she sees.  We can always consult afterwards also, it they do not seem to have good info for you.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24	Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-9-28	13:59:37	Larry-rfaf	Thank you, everyone, for another good session.  Catch you next month.  Go Pack Go!!

I needed some support as the days go by, because daily enemas seem like some sort of hang-up. I know they are helping me, though. I have also changed my diet, mainly vegan, low salt and very low fat.

When the adrenals are fatigued and working harder then they should, the thyroid steps in to save them from exhaustion.  Sometimes these things are not picked up on blood tests until they are so severe.

Oils are also very useful in implants and suppositories because they are meant to stay in the colon longer, which gives them time to absorb.

Also, coconut oils are excellent to give energy during the fast and are also good for the thyroid, to tie the two subjects together.  It is also antimicrobial!

My mother started with me at age 8. It was done in a slow and careful way so I wouldn't dread the procedure.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08	Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-7-27	13:22:49	deedee-ogag	Epsom salts have to be used more cautiously.  It is very purging in nature and too much can be harmful.  One tablespoon in 2 quarts is all you want to use.

If they have no issues, I would not necessarily introduce them.  I would also be careful around puberty time.  This seems to create lasting
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08	Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-7-27	13:26:10	deedee-ogag	impressions, some that may be negative.  Anywhere between infant and 10 yrs. old would be fine, again if the child needs help.  I do not think I would do it on a regular basis otherwise.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08	Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-7-27	13:26:25	deedee-ogag	Done in a very gentle and understanding way, and never making the child feel as if it were a punishment or discipline.

Anything that brings the water closest to its natural state.  I think spring water fits into that category because it has its minerals, but not the toxic elements and additives, etc.

That is why the essential oils and herbs have really interested me.

He was told his dog only had two months to live - that was five months ago, yeah!!  He will probably talk about that more later on.

Drink half of your body weight in water in ounces  (100 lb. person drink 50 oz. daily).  IF you excerise or are outside for periods of time, or drink dehydrating liquids such as

They both can work very well separately, but put them together, and it makes a high, thorough enema much more possible and comfortable.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08	Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-7-27	13:51:20	deedee-ogag	The colon tube starts the water up higher so you avoid that need to purge right away (passes the part with more nerve endings) and the pump then delivers the water so efficiently.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08	Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-7-27	13:51:40	deedee-ogag	It works like a charm and many clients tell me they can hardly feel the pressure and cannot believe how much water they were able to take in so comfortably.

They were very unrehearsed and kind of raw, but hopefully got the information out.

First I just use 48 oz. of plain distilled water at 100 degrees and a gentle massage empties me out within 5 minutes... then within 15 minutes I use 32 oz. of distilled water at 100 degrees with a teaspoon of Celtic sea salt (dissolved) and 4 drops of lavender oil, which I hold for 20 minutes... This last recipe requires a lot of massage to get the peristalsis going.... Do you suggest anything else?

DeeDee has also discovered a method where you use coconut oil in ice cube trays with the essential oils. Free the tray full of implants and use them as suppositories.

We find a couple of day's worth of cleansing with a series of enemas and fasting will get you through so you don't have to take medication.

Some doctors will send you home if you tell them that you did enemas and did not take the meds. so sometimes you can't tell them unfortunately.  Do 2 days of fasting and cleansing with a series of 3 enemas per day.

He thinks enemas are good for us. I heard him talk about it. It would surely help many people with this sometimes misunderstond subject. Let the boss know. Make sure you e-mail if ever you go on TV.

This has always worked well for all I've worked with.

When I do, I will be taking the natural approach.  The drink they give you is hard on the kidneys and nervous system, and getting the stuff out of your system afterwards is important too.

I agree with you, DeeDee, that these so called doctors don't understand that there are other ways of handling something like this. I will sure let everyone know in August.

I have NO problems with anything. Doctor just want to make sure I`m O.K. at 71 yrs old. I'll bet him, I have NO polyps or abnormal problems. I'm taking enemas now for 63 years.

Of course, you still need to be very careful when inserting.

Then when I get it up that far, I let a little trickle of water go in and I work the colon tube up farther, but slowly.

Sometimes you have to slide up and down and change positions of your body too can help.

My voice gets raspy when my thyroid hormones are low (hypothyroid).  But, if my adrenal can't handle the increase in thyroid, I can't take thyroid meds/supplements until the adrenals are stronger.

This is something I know nothing about.  Is this in your book, Kristina?  I bought it and have read parts and scanned it through...

I had a surgery about 5 years ago and finally linked that to my over 100 pound weight gain.  I was already overweight - now I am 300 pounds.

I pretty much just eat whatever because I get so tired of being allergic to so many foods.  I have cut out meats a lot.  That makes me feel better.

Truthfully, you can't have struggles in one part of the body without those imbalances, inflammation, or overload effecting EVERY OTHER part of the body.
8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837	Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-5-11	20:13:43	kristina-iiai	Second of all, elimination of hormones needs to be optimized in order for the adrenals to be healthy.

I have been doing a lot of research lately about the colon and my liver and how you will crave the stuff that your body is allergic to... My friends kid me - and tell me to go to medical school.

It's like doing drugs and flushing out my system completely the next day.  My skin is great, my hair - but it's catching up to me.

And, you would be amazed at how many clients we have who don't eat a healthy diet but claim that they feel great because of their weekly enema.

What I am hoping to accomplish here is - well first I want to buy a better enema system - is to feel the health benefits from the enemas so much that I am encouraged to not eat the bad stuff.

Fresh juicing without fiber is supposed to get the nutrients into the system more quickly, as it doesn't have to be digested.  So, that would be the same for liquid herbals, I would think.

I think the tending the body issue is really key.  That's just not very societally acceptable, really.  But it's so important to listen to our body and heed its call for help.

I don't think using the kombucha for that purpose is a good idea but you can certainly try it. If you like it, it does help with immunity and improving the healthy balance of intestinal flora.

Then, we would work with them over some months through the Optimal Health Center and we could follow their progress on YouTube. If you or anyone you know is interested, I would offer free consults and supplements at cost.

But, first of all, I want to thank you for your excellent website and all the information.  It is really helpful and gives one hope!

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:09:46	deedee-ogag	Yes, sometimes diet changes can make things worse. Can you determine specifically what about the diet you think is causing the most problems for you?

But I've had to use enemas about every 2-3 days.  I wanted the slant board, but don't think will fit in my bathroom, so started with your $8.50

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:11:35	deedee-ogag	Alan, it looks like we have to start internally then with reacted magnesium and some herbs, and topical oils, etc. to heal that area a little more so that you can do some enemas.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:12:28	deedee-ogag	How are the enemas going so far, Heather?  Do you feel you are cleaning out well enough?  Are you having bowel movements between cleansings?
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:12:32	Heather-lhah	Now I'm trying to decide on which enema kit to purchase and what nozzle.   Questions are:  1) How much

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:13:37	Heather-lhah	The enemas are going well.  I'm able to take about 1-2 quarts with each successive one and I feel like I'm cleaning out pretty well.  But, no BMs between cleansings.  I had cut out most supplements, but my MD, using energy, has me on a lot of supplements.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:14:12	Alan D-ogag	I did get a script to help with the fissure - Diltiazem gel.

You only need to soak about 3 - 4 hours, but overnight is OK.  Do you just soak the nozzle or the whole kit and are you doing it every time?
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:15:06	Heather-lhah	Now I'm coming off some long-term medications (prozac, clonazepam) under her care, and she sensed I need a boost in nutrition.  But, I'd love to get the nutrition from food - that will happen.  Maybe I'm still not eating enough fat.  But, trying.

I think I moved too quickly from those to solid foods, or that's my MD's thinking.  Not sure how to answer....

The first attempts were no fun, but now I have the hang of it. Yesterday I did a high enema as the #3 and was able to retain it for a long time (1 hour) then emptied a small portion.

If it is an implant like coffee or aloe juice/olive oil, or probiotics, those you can hold for longer periods of time.

I'm sticking with the Enzymedica Digest Gold, but my MD switched me from the Biolkult to something called Perque Digesta Guard Forte.

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:28:50	deedee-ogag	Heather, doing enemas will help to tone the colon and should help transit time along with the enzymes and probiotics, but sometimes people use herbs such as fenugreek and chamomile to help transit time.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:30:21	gleener-lhah	Joseph try letting in a cup of the water to open those valves.

You may need to switch positions a little also to get a better angle.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb	Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-4-27	13:30:36	Heather-lhah	I think I have had gas and bloating for so many years that perhaps got the peristalsis going, and now that I no longer have gas/bloating, it may just take time to retrain my body's peristalsis.  Do they take fenugreek and chamomile in the enema or orally?

Might this be on the increase? Didn't hear much mention back when enemas and other colon care was routine.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:06:29	Dave-ueae	Yes, a good one.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:06:55	deedee-ogag	Dave, I think you are right.  Colon cancer is probably on the rise due to the increase in our poor diets and people being told it is OK if you only go to the bathroom every third day
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:07:08	deedee-ogag	Randy, you can ask any question you want.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:08:42	randyu-ogag	I have

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:10:45	deedee-ogag	There was also Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez who says he recommends to his cancer patients to take a couple of

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:12:49	deedee-ogag	Randy, I can also help you to come off of medication and to heal that IBS.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:13:24	randyu-ogag	Yes, DeeDee, what about proper equipment?  Should I have someone else help give the enema to me? I have not had one in many years.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:13:42	deedee-ogag	Yes, people are finally starting to talk about alternative health practices. (We say alternative, but they were so mainstream so many years ago.)
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:14:31	deedee-ogag	Randy, if you have someone willing to give the enema to you, that is great, and can be relaxing, but if you don't, you can definitely do it yourself with a little practice.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:15:00	deedee-ogag	Randy, you can call me here at the center, and I will help you pick out enema equipment.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:15:51	Dave-ueae	Yes, sight of a bag or enema can stored  on a bathroom door was almost routine.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:16:03	deedee-ogag	I have a great new healing way to do suppositories.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:16:06	randyu-ogag	Yes I would like to come off meds. I will give a call, DeeDee. 
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:16:32	deedee-ogag	Great, Randy. Look forward to talking with you.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:17:35	randyu-ogag	Suppositories work, but glycerin has side effects.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:17:52	randyu-ogag	DeeDee, when is a good time to call you?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:17:56	deedee-ogag	I have done these healing suppositories on myself and have been giving others the recipes and oils/herbs to do them and, wow!  do they work nicely. I should have testimonials about them soon.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:18:07	deedee-ogag	Even though this is not a new concept, the way I am starting to recommend them is new to most people.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:18:24	michael b.-ckak	People are getting away from "take 2 asprin and call me in the morning."

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:19:41	deedee-ogag	I use

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:20:57	Dave-ueae	Do the suppositrie melt fast for absorption, and should an enema precede it?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:21:41	deedee-ogag	Aspirin is willow tree bark.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:22:11	randyu-ogag	Suppositories don't clean, just relieve. Enemas do both and work faster and better, right?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:23:10	deedee-ogag	Dave, yes, they do melt quickly, they are very easy to insert, and you should do them in evening when you can lie down until you know how your body will react to them (we don't want embarrassing oil leaking). You should be cleaned out first if possible.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:24:00	deedee-ogag	Enemas do work much better than the normal suppository. I am using suppositories for healing purposes, not eliminating purposes.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:25:28	Dave-ueae	Can't ever recall getting a suppository, just a soap stick once as a child that was followed by an enema anyway. 
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:25:37	randyu-ogag	How much water is the norm for adults?  One quart at a time?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:25:43	deedee-ogag	These suppositories deliver healing oils/herbs into the body so we can directly heal hemorrhoids,  fissures, IBS, prostate issues, etc.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:26:21	Dave-ueae	Do you manufacture the suppository at OHN?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:27:35	deedee-ogag	Randy, many people work up to 3 - 4 quart enemas for a high enema and thorough cleanse.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:28:38	randyu-ogag	For a lower bowel cleanse only, about a quart for that?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:28:55	deedee-ogag	Dave, I make the oil/herb combinations here and put them in a bottle, and give instructions on how people can make the suppositories at home - they are very easy.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:29:09	deedee-ogag	Unfortunately it would be hard to ship the coconut oil as a suppository because it would melt above 76 degrees.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:29:33	deedee-ogag	I make them up here though for clients wanting to have one after their

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:30:16	Dave-ueae	Sounds good.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:30:23	deedee-ogag	I use a rounded (smaller) ice cube tray and about 1 tablespoon of melted coconut oil per suppository  -  add your oils/herbs to this and cool until firm.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:30:56	deedee-ogag	Randy, 1 - 2 quarts for a lower bowel cleanse is fine.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:31:23	deedee-ogag	Randy, we also recommend a series of enemas here (3) that gets the colon very cleaned out.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:31:46	Dave-ueae	I think vintage enema cans and bags were 2 quarts/liters. Bags seem smaller now.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:34:52	deedee-ogag	The two quart enema will be a temporary fix, but to really get cleaned out, we recommend the

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:36:29	deedee-ogag	You don't have to do enemas consecutive days, but do several or have someone perform a colonic to get you started if you can find that in your area.  If not, no worries, it can be done at home.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:37:21	deedee-ogag	It is a cold day here in Wisconsin.  How is it by you all?

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:37:44	randyu-ogag	Cold, snowy here... icy... winter.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:39:32	randyu-ogag	Yes, common but embarassing to talk about with someone, even doctor or nurse.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:40:02	deedee-ogag	Dave, yes, colonics are becoming more popular, but we are trying to bring back the enema for in home, because of the economy, etc.,  people may not be able to have as many colonics as they should.

I cannot make specific recommendations unless we do that and I have a health intake form from you.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:50:58	deedee-ogag	I got a little something (and I never really get sick anymore), but it went away a lot faster for me than other people.   Cleansing can really get you through that.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:51:36	deedee-ogag	Madison is great!   The office number is 608-242-0200  or you can e-mail me at  deedee@[ourdomain].com.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:52:25	deedee-ogag	Yes, medication is hard on the liver and colon.  Cleansing is very beneficial for that.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:53:02	Dave-ueae	With mild flu: a colonic or just an enema or two?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:53:33	deedee-ogag	Dave, either is good.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:54:49	deedee-ogag	I am looking forward to preparing some antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial suppositories for next year's flu season!

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:55:49	randyu-ogag	Yes, how did you know that?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:56:28	michael b.-ckak	I have been without flu for awhile. I keep following the diet changes and colon cleansing Kristina suggested starting 5 years ago. Must be doing right.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:56:42	deedee-ogag	Yes, enemas/colonics flush the "bad stuff" out more quickly and make the liver and other organs more able to deal with detoxifying the body.  It also boosts the immune system.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:57:18	Dave-ueae	Randy, when you said "not at all"...

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:58:01	Dave-ueae	... a  love/hate thing at the time?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:58:19	randyu-ogag	Yes.

Some households never practiced them for some reason though.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:58:52	Dave-ueae	It was bittersweet for many.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:59:39	deedee-ogag	Kids of course do not like to be given them, so many people have that bad memory.  Then they start again as adults and really find the benefits.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:59:47	Dave-ueae	Yes, , it was common but not 100 percent in families.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	13:59:48	randyu-ogag	Yes, they were used to cool high fever, too, worked well, and to help relieve constipation.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	14:00:47	deedee-ogag	Yes, the many benefits of a good cleanse  -  and now we can explore even more benefits with them by looking into how we can use implanting for healing  - all very exciting to me!
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	14:00:49	randyu-ogag	Hospitals still use them.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	14:02:42	deedee-ogag	They give them too quickly and many times with chemicals/additives that create cramping.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96	Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-23	14:03:21	randyu-ogag	Maybe I should take a vacation in Madison?

I want to continue my enemas, but I'm concerned about this.  I don't want mildew growing in my enema bag.  Any ideas?

I've tried several cleaners which have helped, but the mildew remains, especially on the shower curtain.

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423	Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-9	20:25:58	kristina-iiai	I will go change that right now!

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423	Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-9	20:31:57	kristina-iiai	The question that we should instead ask is: how is it that the control on this self-recognition is lost?

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423	Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-3-9	20:47:20	Brett-rfaf	Have you thought about doing research on this?

The suppositories work well before sleep.  You just put them in and lie down and the absorb into the area directly.

3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a	Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-2-23	13:35:34	deedee-ogag	Dennis, the colon tube usually curls because the passageway is not open enough for it to keep traveling.  Do you use water flowing in when you are inserting?  Also, try different positions to try to open the passageway better.
3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a	Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-2-23	13:36:19	deedee-ogag	Doug, what have you tried in your water?

I can make up the dram bottle of oil and you would make the suppositories at home using coconut oil. You liquify it first, pour it into a little container,

When you are ready, you pop it out and form it with your hands like clay into the shape of a suppository and then insert it.

I can then personalize your oil to go with it.

I think the addiction comes into play like anything else, when you are using them for other purposes that may not be the healthiest and excessively without the physical need.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:29:29	Dave-ueae	Same therapist, who is 60+ and from Europe, said she had her first colonic when 17  years old and 5 months pregnant. No ill effects, but has OHN covered the topic of enemas and colonics and pregnancy in case others would be interested?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:30:32	michael b-fjaj	I think the different oils offered by Young Living are amazing ,and their concept of diffusing the same oils into the air we breath is most interesting.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:31:01	deedee-ogag	Donna, maybe we can make the cleaning out more efficient for you so that you feel like you are getting everything.  It makes a difference of how much water you are using, what is in the water, the equipment you are using, etc.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:31:08	dennis r-iiai	Dr. Oz on TV supports enemas. He talked about that not long ago.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:32:26	deedee-ogag	I love

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:33:37	Jack A.-lhah	DeeDee, is there a particular combination of soap, water, peppermint, etc., that would  help a person eliminate a 2/3 quart enema rather than retaining it, or most of it, for hours?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:33:44	deedee-ogag	Yes, I have heard that Dr. Oz is an enema promoter.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:33:59	donnaj-ogag	I have the 4-qt silicone bag.  Do the essential oils gunk up the tubing at all?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:34:48	deedee-ogag	Jack, I would try the soap, peppermint, and salt separately at first so you can tell if there is one thing that is making you hold.  How much salt are you currently using per quart?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:35:40	deedee-ogag	Essential oils do need to be rinsed well with hot soapy water afterwards to eliminate the residue, but they are such pure oils that we don't have much problems with them.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:35:47	deedee-ogag	Hi, Scott.

Massaging the abdomen is very important also.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:41:42	DanH-ueae	Joining late, but upon 2 or 3 cleansing enemas, has there been any discussion regarding implants afterward?

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:43:58	Scott-rfaf	I've found that retention is more likely with very warm solutions. Massage and positional changes help move things for me.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:43:59	deedee-ogag	Dan, we have been talking a little bit about how effective the colon is at absorbing, so that minerals, herbs, essential oils, etc. can work wonders.  Do you have a particular thing you want to implant?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:44:39	Dave-ueae	 I've not had a big retention problem. I do find I do a lot of absorption when dehydrated, but I guess that is to be expected? Soap suds help prevent retention.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:46:06	deedee-ogag	Yes, soap can be very helpful because it is purging - especially peppermint.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:46:29	Scott-rfaf	I agree that soap suds preclude retention.

It works well after 2-3 cleansing sessions.  We've done a recipe of olive, coconut, flaxseed oils, MSM, bifidonate, aloe vera juice, and pure water.  Any other recipes?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c	Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2011-1-26	13:49:37	deedee-ogag	Michael, hah!  I will tell her that.  I know her wrists bother her when she is doing too much typing.

What are you looking for specifically in your implant?  Healing from something specific?

Very difficult to retain and way too harsh. Bronner's peppermint and regular castille soap packs are my preference these days.

b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:06:00	ddelkamp-iiai	I was just reading a study that they have done on oregano oil.  We know it has antimicrobial properties, so they were putting it onto meat before grilling so that the meat would not have to be cooked as long, saving some of the nutrients and enzymes.  
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:07:22	michael b-fjaj	I have not had a chance to do anything with the minerals yet.

b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:07:48	ddelkamp-iiai	Oregano oil is one of the essential oils we have been using here. Just thought that was interesting and potentially really great!!
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:08:50	ddelkamp-iiai	.  It depends on the oil and its properties as to how it will work best.  Also, everyone responds differently.  What oils are you wanting to work with?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:09:57	Dave-ueae	Perhaps lavender and other soothing ones.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:10:12	ddelkamp-iiai	Did you have questions about the minerals, Michael?

If you are trying to soothe the intestines, rubbing over your whole stomach area and doing an implant of the lavender should both work very well.

b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:16:03	ddelkamp-iiai	I will be doing the

b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:18:22	Dave-ueae	Monthly or a bit more frequently year-round, including OHN of course, lol.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:19:46	Dave-ueae	Lot of therapists tell me they follow the same schedule.

I have been using lemongrass on my clients.  This is very good for killing all the bad bacteria and also restoring the good flora as well as working on constipation.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:21:19	ddelkamp-iiai	Yes, I try do a cleanse monthly for maintenance, and if I am doing a fast, etc.,  I do it more frequently.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:21:50	Dave-ueae	A few drops in the water or as implant?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:22:50	ddelkamp-iiai	I use about 6-12 drops in the water as I am doing the cleansing part of the colonic (or enema) and then about 6 drops at the end with a little water and have the client hold for 10 minutes or so.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:23:13	michael b-fjaj	It has been 5 years since I found Kristina's website. My concern at that time was toxins that I had been exposed to.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:25:05	ddelkamp-iiai	Do you feel that you removed most of your toxins at this point, Michael?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:26:25	ddelkamp-iiai	So Michael, what is keeping you from trying your mineral implant?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:27:53	Dave-ueae	Will have to try lemongrass next time. Have several binding drugs at work.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:28:42	ddelkamp-iiai	I will tell you a little more about lemongrass.  Just jump in with any questions about that or anything.  Lemongrass is used for purification and digestion.  It is antifungal, antibacterial, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, regenerates connective tissue, and ligaments, dilates blood vessels, improves circulation, and promotes lymph flow.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:29:41	ddelkamp-iiai	This would be a great oil to use when the flu hits.  Especially the stomach flu.  To rub on and to use in an enema!
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:31:32	Dave-ueae	Stomach flu and enemas seem contradictory on the surface, but some of us learned early they were not.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:32:32	michael b-fjaj	Hi again, DeeDee. I am much more aware of toxins now, and avoid them, but now know more about ridding my body of them, much thanks to OHN.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:33:20	ddelkamp-iiai	That is very true.  Doing an enema during the flu helps the body to rid itself of the virus more quickly and makes the length of the illness much shorter and less severe.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:35:28	ddelkamp-iiai	How are your immune systems holding up?  Are you on vitamin D?  Our

b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:37:51	ddelkamp-iiai	That is very true.  Dave, did you receive

b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:41:57	ddelkamp-iiai	Yes, not to offend, but some of the older clients I have do tell me about those experiences and how even though they did not like getting them at the time, they did make them feel better.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:42:14	ddelkamp-iiai	Others in the same age range never experienced them, so it is interesting on how some had them in their house and others didn't.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:43:57	michael b-fjaj	The latest I have read is that flu shots still have mercury, aluminium, and formaldehyde.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:45:39	ddelkamp-iiai	You are probably right about the shots, though they will tell you that they are perfectly safe.  I never get them for myself or my family.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:46:54	Dave-ueae	Very typical bittersweet memories. Most of my neighbor friends had homes with bags displayed in the bathroom. No secrets. But there are others that were non-enema, as you say.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380	Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-12-22	13:48:23	ddelkamp-iiai	I wonder if the enema bag users were more of the natural healer types of households.

Soy acts like an estrogen in the body and can definitely lead to an imbalance of hormones.  We would need to make sure the digestive system and liver were working well first. (The liver helps to remove the excess hormones in the body.)

Also do you think there are any tests that I should do prior to that discussion to give a more clear picture of what is going on?

I know of people that were kind of stuck in the recovery and once they did a food allergy test and removed some items that they were eating regularly, they started getting better.

Then you implant smaller amounts of the chlorophyll (a couple of ounces) and retain for as long as your body lets you.   You can also take chlorophyll perles  orally before enemas.

Every problem in your body is recognized by your brain. Any weakness or symptom in the body, any in balance with hormones, blood sugar or emotional health, any physical trauma and any sign of accelerating gene is it knowledge to the brain. Essential Oil Body Feedback  uses the connection of the brain and the body along with therapeutic grade essential oils to tell you what your body requires to promote a fabulous colon cleanse and to promote healing.

Then you smell essential oils and after you exhale, regress the tender area on the body to see if it is less tender, the same or worse. The body provides the feedback to let you know which essential oils promote the best healing for your individual needs.

8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2	Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-11-10	20:20:48	kristina-iiai	 Here connections are made with several areas of the brain that register problems and health concerns of the body.

This effect can be measured by checking key areas of tenderness on the body.

It seems that it is best to rotate your essential oils similar to rotating foods in your diet.

Do you clear out the colon before you take a coffee enema? How often do you take a coffee enema? How much coffee do you use? How long have you been taking the coffee enemas? When you say I feel bad, what exactly do you mean? How do you feel  badly?
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2	Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-11-10	20:28:15	hanna750-iiai	Yes, I do a water enema first and then the coffee and retain it for 15 min.  I've been doing them for 2 yrs now.  I do add a tsp of

The coffee enema does make me feel worse but maybe it's detoxing.  I wish it would make me feel better.  I guess my question is: could it be circulating the toxins?
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2	Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-11-10	20:36:13	Joseph-ogag	Hi Kris - just wanted to say I bought the 32fr 30 inch colon tube from you and I love it.

It was way less intimidating than I imagined once I saw the small package, and I got about 18" in the first time (only used it once so far), and I could take the 2 quarts very easily.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2	Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-11-10	20:40:30	kristina-iiai	 Magnesium, besides being an essential mineral for regular bowel movements, is present in most cells and plays an essential role as the cofactor, assisting enzymes and catalyzing many necessary chemical reactions. Magnesium functions in reactive processes, such as nerve conduction, muscular movement, bone metabolism, protein synthesis, fat and carbohydrate metabolism, and glucose utilization.

8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2	Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-11-10	20:46:14	kristina-iiai	 I would also make sure that it is the coffee enema that's causing the problem. I would do an enema series without using the coffee implant to see if you have the same results. I would also vary the amount of coffee that you use,  vary the water source that you use,  vary the stimulant that you use, etc. With the method, biofeedback method,  that we are soon to have on our website, you can learn how to test all of these factors to determine which choices are best for you on a given day.

They offer household cleaners with oil of thieves, foaming hand soap, and more oils than I could imagine. Also diffusers, thinking it is most wonderful to have the scent of oils in your daily life.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2	Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-11-10	20:47:30	kristina-iiai	 Chlorella binds toxins tightly. Once coffee stimulates your gallbladder to contract and release toxin-laden bile into the small intestine, you want something where the bile duct enters  the intestine to bind the toxins so tightly they will not be read and sort through the intestinal wall.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2	Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-11-10	20:48:13	kristina-iiai	 What this means is that you take a handful of chlorella tablets, 15 to 30 tablets, timed to precede the start of the enema by about 30 minutes.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2	Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-11-10	20:48:41	kristina-iiai	 Just before starting the enema,  take an additional handful of chlorella tablets - about 5 to 15 tablets.

It is the ratio of these four minerals that is one of the cornerstones to good health. This is because these are the main minerals used for cellular respiration. These are the main four minerals - potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium - that  assist the body, each and every cell, to take in nutrients and to release waste.

However, if one is going to lie on their side, I recommend that you start out on your left side and once all the solution is in the colon,  move on to your right side, slowly, using your back.

However, if you call DeeDee and tell her to get together with me  to send you a care package, I will make sure that happens within the next week. You let her know I said this. Also, because I had to move into an apartment building, Arlo has a new home and I have two adorable kittens.

I have been working closely with a friend of ours who is an acupuncturist and we are beginning to use essential oils (Young Living) in our treatments.

Essential oils are the life source of the plant and carry the highest healing frequency of all supplements.  When properly processed, therapeutic grade essential oils are safe to drink, apply to

These oils are highly effective because their nutrients are readily assimilated on a cellular level, bypassing normal digestion.

Some oils are well known to be cleansing oils, like citrus oils...lemon, orange, etc., but peppermint can be very stimulating to the colon.

You can go up as far as is comfortable with your colon tube.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a	Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-10-27	13:16:30	Dee Dee-lhah	You never want to force the tube, but rather work it in slowly, and add small amounts of water as you go to help and open up the colon for easier insertion.

Celtic Sea Salt delivers minerals. Enema coffee promotes cleansing of the gallbladder, liver and blood.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a	Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-10-27	13:34:00	Dee Dee-lhah	Aloe juice and olive oil along with MSM promotes healing of joints and the mucosal lining of the colon, and probiotics will help to regulate the intestinal flora. The oils we will be using have endless possibilites for healing, so I think they will be absolutely great for everything.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a	Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-10-27	13:35:18	Dee Dee-lhah	When you take in a large enema, you will not be holding that too long, so a plug will probably not be necessary.  You can expel that on the toilet shorly after taking it in.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a	Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-10-27	13:35:47	Dee Dee-lhah	Where the plug comes in handy is when you are taking these smaller implants that you need to hold longer.  The plug, for some people, helps you to hold the implant longer.

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a	Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-10-27	13:38:53	Dee Dee-lhah	The length of time for holding each implant will be different, depending on the result you are trying to achieve.  Coffee is held for 15 minutes, but you would want to hold many of these oil implants for a long time - until they naturally come out with your next bowel movement.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a	Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-10-27	13:39:31	Shirley B-fjaj	I use straight white vinegar for grease on the kitchen counters. Would that be suitable for the colon tubes?

I do allow the coffee to "steep" in me for about 15 min., while lying down (couldn't resist the coffee pun). Are the other implants about 1 qt? 1 pint?

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a	Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-10-27	13:46:31	Dee Dee-lhah	I will be putting drops of essential oil right into the hose of the colonic system after cleansing and following it with a small amount of water.

They must know this instinctively.  I have also heard of people getting nauseous after taking wheat grass.

I used to use Shaklee's, but I think they are discontinuing it.  I will try and remember the other brand name I have used which I think is still good.

Is it because people are looking into more natural health practices and are sick of taking medications?  what do you think?

In the circle of the raw food movement, they talk a lot about colon hydrotherapy, and the importance of detox. Some have mentioned coffee enemas too, and the Gerson therapy is widely discussed there too for cancer patients.

He recommended more fiber and eating prunes, but no mention of enemas.

In my area here, we went from highs in the upper nineties/low 100's to the mid 70's in two days.  That's movement.

This inflammation is generally fatal.
d8a9184592ed0f92c059b2f83826eb4a709a6814	Colon Cleansing and Vitamin D Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-8-11	20:31:29	kristina-iiai	This new solution to acute inflammation in the brain is called therapeutic hypothermia: Ice the patients body to lower their temperature by about six degrees and induce a coma for up to 24 hours. This process limits inflammation and can allow people to return to a healthy life after their heart has been inactive for up to twenty minutes.

d8a9184592ed0f92c059b2f83826eb4a709a6814	Colon Cleansing and Vitamin D Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-8-11	20:32:53	kristina-iiai	Many people focus on their outward health and forget that colon health is essential to one's overall well-being. In fact, the Center for Disease Control (CDC)  reported that in 2006, over 139,000 people were diagnosed with colon cancer and over 53,000 people died from colon cancer. Obviously colon health cannot be ignored. Besides pursuing colon health for the prevention of colon cancer, having a healthier colon can promote weight loss, increase energy, reduce fatigue, and even cure headaches. However, the answer is not getting the quick fix with pharmaceuticals. While many prescribed drugs can reduce or even eliminate symptoms of colon problems, they do not address a fundamental lack of colon health.

It was found that those who experience sufficient social interactions were 50 per cent more likely to be alive when re-examined eight years later than those who were more socially isolated

Could wide use of enemas and other colon care back then have helped keep cancer down?

Our food has changed in leaps and bounds in a relatively short time, while our digestive system, particularly our colon, has not been able to keep up. For thousands of years we survived on basic foods such as fruit, game meat, nuts, and wild vegetables. However, in the last hundred years particularly, food has changed drastically: grain-fed meats, potato chips fried in trans fats, and dairy produced with hormones now line the shelves of many grocery stores. These toxins and unnatural foods can clog the colon and may increase the risk of colon cancer.

Your vitamin D levels can drop as much as 50% in the winter. Depleted of vitamin D, your immune system may not be up to its full potential, leaving you more susceptible to certain health concerns. In fact, I strongly believe that vitamin D deficiency is a growing epidemic!

For example, memory ductile cells in the breast need vitamin D to access DNA that enables the response to estrogen. So naturally, without sufficient amounts of vitamin D, your cells cannot access their DNA libraries and their functions are thereby impaired.   This is why vitamin D functions in so many different tissues, and affects such a large number of different diseases and health conditions. So far, scientists have found about 3,000 genes that are upregulated by vitamin D. Receptors that respond to the vitamin have been found in almost every type of human cell, from your brain to your bones. And researchers keep finding health benefits from vitamin D in virtually every area they look.

We examined the risk of dying from any cause in subjects who participated in randomized trials testing the impact of vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol [vitamin D2] or cholecalciferol [vitamin D3]) on any health condition.

The relationship between baseline vitamin D status, dose of vitamin D supplements, and total mortality rates remains to be investigated. Population-based, placebo-controlled randomized trials with total mortality as the main end point should be organized for confirming these findings.

If the response is mostly that one feels better, then as much as daily. If the response of the body is to feel worse, than I wouldn't recommend the coffee enema more than one time a month, unless constipation is an issue.

Betaine has been shown to be an effective lipotrophic agent. Lipotrophic agents promote the transportation and use of fats, helping to prevent the accumulation of fat in the liver. Vitamin A has an important and specific effect on lipid metabolism. Bovine liver and orchic extract are important in the metabolism of blood fats.

This will enable your adrenal glands to relax. It is the adrenal glands that raise the blood sugar between meals when we go more than 2½ hours without eating. Some people feel hungry, tired, unfocused, or perhaps hyper throughout the day as their adrenal glands compensate for the drop in blood sugar. Instead of having the stress hormones cortisol and adrenalin do the work to keep the blood sugar at a normal level, it is better to eat and let your adrenals take a vacation.

Try using only the sea salt and no peppermint. Try taking just a water enema or just a coffee enema. Experiment with all the elements to see if one of them is bothering you.

Some believe that Lyme Disease is the underlying causative agent of many chronic health conditions, including but not limited to: allergies, heart arrhythmias, arthritis (both osteo and rheumatoid), ADD, auto-immune disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, macular degeneration, sensory or motor radiculoneuropathies (i.e., clumsiness in the hands or feet and/or burning, tingling or numbness), Alzheimer's Disease, ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), Bell's palsy, irritable bowel syndrome and gastrointestinal distress, lupus, polymyalgia rheumatica (a more severe form of fibromyalgia), sleep disorders, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, brain fog, memory loss, joint pain/swelling/stiffness, lack of coordination, unexplained chills and fevers, recurrent infections, poor concentration, tremors, shortness of breath, anxiety or panic attacks, heart palpitations, weight changes (loss or gain), sore throats, loss of appetite, muscle pain or cramps, obsessive compulsive disorders, headaches/migraines, light sensitivity, trigeminal neuralgia, unexplained hair loss, and visual changes.

Swelling in upper leg and the critter visible. Dermatologist extracted it. Want some of our spare deer? We have many. many!
03de70cb2ada0fe54647f26c5f8d505a92330b70	Lyme Disease and Immunity Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-6-9	20:10:37	kristina-iiai	a recent study demonstrated the efficacy of Cat's Claw (Unicaria tomentosa) in destroying the Lyme organism. In fact, in the study, the control group of 14 patients all took antibiotics and only 3 improved slightly, 3 got worse and the remainder had no change in their clinical condition. The experimental group was treated with Cat's Claw and 85% of them were negative for the Lyme organism after 6 months and all the patients experienced a dramatic improvement in their clinical condition. (Cowden, WE, MD, et al., "Lyme Disease: Nutraceutical Breakthrough Using TOA-Free Cat's Claw", Focus, Feb '04, pp.3,4) In utilizing Cat's Claw, it is extremely important that the quality and purity of the product be assured. This herb occurs naturally in 2 forms: the more common TOA form and the rarer POA form. For those of you with a chemical bent, TOA stands for tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid and POA for pentacyclic oxindole alkaloid. Only the POA form is effective in stimulating the immunity which destroys the organism. As little as 1% TOA can cause a 30% reduction in the immune system modulating properties that POAs provide. Unfortunately some commercially available products contain as much as 80% TOAs. (Ibid, p. 3) The Medi-Herb Cat's Claw that we use at the RFHC is 1.5% to 2.0% POAs, the highest concentration available, and is TOA free. Therefore, the amount needed is less, making it much more affordable than other POA products on the market. We did a cost study and determined that using Medi-Herb Cat's Claw was very cost effective. ($60 for a month's supply vs. $325 for a month's supply from the other retailer.)

For optimum health, your body relies on a properly functioning immune system. Two naturally-ocurring plant compounds, sterols and sterolins, have been found to provide significant immune-regulating benefits. Even though they are widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, few people consume sufficient quantities of these foods to achieve maximum benifits. Exciting new clinical research published by leading immunologist, Prof. P. Bouic, Ph.D, demonstrates that supplementation with the patented combination of sterols and sterolins found in Moducare Sterinol can play an important role in optimizing your body's immune function.

This attachment firmly holds the rectum in place. Various factors, such as age, long-term constipation, and the stress of childbirth, may cause these ligaments and muscles to weaken, which means that the rectum's attachment to the body also weakens. This causes the rectum to prolapse, meaning it slips or falls out of place. Occasionally, large hemorrhoids  (large, swollen veins inside the rectum) may predispose the rectum to prolapse.

However, there are herbs in this formula that act on the colon in such a way to reduce its functioning: buckthorn bark and turkey rhubarb.

Mine came from Kristina's website. It is a larger scale 48-in. I can get about 3 feet in. Is there any special feeling that lets one know that it is up as far as it can go?

I'll do an enema as last resort but maybe it should get higher priority.

I would start with a week of the Core Restore and then switch over to a daily supplement that supports liver and digestive health which would include ingredients such as ox bile, pancreatin, dehydrocholic acid, and black radish.

I've been on the WAPF diet for almost 4 months, trying as hard as I can to eat like your book and am doing a great job really.

Do others have this issue? I like to use it to loosen things, but my system seems to fight it.

It is the liver, kidneys, and blood that do the invaluable work of continually clearing the body so it can remain in balance.

I also recommend the warmest water so a refill is often needed to keep the water temperature high enough with the second enema in the enema series.

This is why you take multiple enemas at one time, over a 30-60 minute period.

Also, how much peppermint oil to a 2 quart bag of water?

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:38:09	TomE-ueae	is the new 5-ft colon tube the same as the 30-in I bought from you?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:39:11	TomE-ueae	I bought the delrin tip tube but find it a bit too much and use the standard one fine

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:40:57	kristina-iiai	yes
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:41:29	Dave-ueae	Thanks, that was my impression.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:42:01	kristina-iiai	Most experts do say to deliver the coffee enema solution past the rectal area but not beyond the sigmoid colon.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:42:39	kristina-iiai	yes, to the new colon tube is the same FR diameter as the 30-inch colon tube, just longer.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:43:12	emmettb-lhah	Kris, I work in home health. About 3 weeks ago picked up scabies in a home i was in. I've been using an online brand to stop this. It's not working. Any advice?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:43:58	kristina-iiai	I don't recommend delivering the entire five feet of colon tube into the colon, but having a longer colon tube can make it easier to insert the colon tube deeper into the colon.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:44:50	TomE-ueae	I can use the 30-in but think only a few more inches would be the limit.  The longer length would be nicer though.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:46:02	Tom P-rfaf	Kristina... have you encountered the idea that frequent colonics, or high enemas, can aid in the treatment of ADD or ADHD for preteens?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:46:58	kristina-iiai	To clear out scabies, use an essential oil like peppermint, lavender or tea tree oil. Other essential oils that are reported to work well to eliminate scabies are anise and ylang-ylang.

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:52:32	kristina-iiai	For instance, if you have a fatty liver, you can damage your liver if you jump into a spring cleanse without proper preparation.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:52:42	kristina-iiai	Excellent, Tom.

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b	Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-3-10	20:54:43	kristina-iiai	If toxins that are stored in the bodily tissues are released but the body cannot eliminate them easily and fully, you can damage organs.

Is it helpful to consume a high fiber drink following them, so the bile and residue that is released from the liver isn't reabsorbed? Is that an issue?
44e06358f1e3eaa5d0a4ef2ee5d2a5fc4751a781	Enema Solutions and Vitamin D Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-2-24	13:04:10	kristina-iiai	Yes, it is an issue.

Phytocore was created as part of The Core Restore BT Kit.  Phytocore supports phase I and phase II detoxification by providing phytonutrients to help eliminate toxins and stimulate the liver during a 7-28 day detoxification program. Silymarin may be one of the most well known liver supporting agents in alternative medicine.  Silymarin has a strong history of use for its role in protecting the liver from medications and environmental contaminants.  Silymarin, along with curcumin and radish root increase phase II enzyme activity in the liver while artichoke, yellow dock, and dandelion root act as gentle choleretic agents.

Plus, some consumer investigations had found that Ivory's antimicrobial activity was better than other skin soaps, even those containing antibacterials such as triclosan.[citation needed] A postulate for this effectiveness is the ability of the soap to lyse bacteria efficiently, and to rinse cleanly. The drawback to the soap was its drying effect on the skin, as it had easily dissolved natural oils. Of all the commercial soaps, Ivory has been considered the best by holistic health people, but was criticized for what it did not contain, glycerin. One reason was that glycerin was expensive and would raise the cost of the bars, which had the value of being about the least expensive soap available for people of modest means.

This is because overexposure to UVB rays, which affect the surface layers of skin, quickly causes sunburns. On the other hand, UVA rays are responsible for the golden-brown tan sought after by most salon patrons. As a result, most tanning salons calibrate their tanning beds to emit approximately 95 percent UVA rays. This calibration maximizes the tanning effects of the machine and minimizes the risk of burning. Unfortunately, it also minimizes the amount of vitamin D that can be metabolized relative to the exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays. In other words, you want your tanning bed calibrated to maximize the amount of vitamin D that your body can metabolze relative to the exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays.

I was really trying to find out what I'd done wrong to deserve that!

I've been around Spanish speaker for most of my life, but found these folks had trouble commuicating with each other because of dialect.  Which flavor have you learned?

ae2115537814c9ea42b54668f9077454defba85b	Made-for-Enema Coffee Alternative Health Live Chat	2010-1-13	20:33:37	kristina-iiai	And, the mucous layer has weight.

One needs to call us up as we don't offer it on the website due to Standard Process policy of always starting on these supplements only with a consult first.

How else could I have found you from California? I went, carefully, over the various products you make available through your website but I have no experience with using enemas.

I would also like to do the colonic irrigation type of enemas. When I telephoned your office today, I was too late to reach staff.

I've never done these type of things entirely on my own. I have gone for colonics. I make freshly squeezed vegetable juices, lighly steam my vegetables.

I am keen on doing the kidney, gall-bladder and liver flushes. But now I know coffee enemas are the best course of action. WHAT, which ones, do I buy?

Then there were all the different sizes, tubes, containers but, especially, whatever the "pumps" are used for.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620	Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat	2009-11-11	20:11:30	Dave-ueae	This opens up the whole topic of seasonal and specialized (liver, kidney, etc.) cleansings.

I think I like the clear plastic bag, maybe the pail.

Shoes, I know my size, but I would like to know I may have accidentally chosen exactly what I'd like to have.

Many people in forums I've read cut out or greatly decrease their dairy intake, and saw improvement in their skin.  I think it's the hormones in milk that's the culprit.

One of the body's 4 exits for its release of toxins so I used one for years but no longer have access to one. How do you find it compares with the infrared?

Blood shows the bound forms of the hormone. the body also keeps the blood homeostatic, meaning that levels of hormones are maintained and only fluctuate when hormone levels are VERY imbalanced. You will find hormone imbalances in the saliva before you find them in the blood, in other words.

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18	Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat	2009-10-28	13:17:45 	kristina-iiai	The Female Hormone Panel (FHP)™ is a simple, non-invasive test. Eleven saliva samples are collected during specified time periods throughout a menstrual cycle.  For the first time in routine medical practice, the FHP will allow both patient and doctor to view the profile of Estrogen and Progesterone (See Figure 1). In addition, we report the cycle average for Testosterone and DHEA. Diagnostic guesswork is minimized, and hormonal balance evaluation and customized treatment become a reality with the FHP.   The expanded FHP (eFHPTM) also includes 5 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) measurements to see if both brain control and stimulation of the ovaries is optimal.   Applications of the Female Hormone Panel  The FHP can be used to detect and monitor the following:   Functional infertility  Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)  Fibroids
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18	Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat	2009-10-28	13:17:54 	kristina-iiai	 Influence of lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) on the hormone cycle   Menstrual problems originating in the brains systems   Early pregnancy problems - spontaneous miscarriage   Cycle irregularities following the use of birth control pills   Dysmenorrhea, i.e. painful and heavy periods  Migraine headaches   Endometriosis and cystic ovarian disease  Early Osteoporosis  Advantages of the FHP 
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18	Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat	2009-10-28	13:18:04 	kristina-iiai	1. Convenience: requires no blood draws, therefore no repeated clinic visits, and avoids the inconvenience of the 24-hour urine collection.   2. Customized Hormone Therapy Presently, female hormone therapy is not individualized to the needs of each woman because current diagnostic tests do not provide sufficient data. Consequently, most women are treated without regard to their individualized physiology and specific needs. The FHP, for the first time, will allow a clinician to customize therapy to each woman.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18	Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat	2009-10-28	13:18:14 	kristina-iiai	3. As is typical in most clinics, one or two blood samples or a 24-hour analysis of urine for these hormones cannot give an idea of the ovaries' hormonal productivity. The FHP gives a good approximation of the ovaries capacity over a whole cycle.

The extended MH panel measures these six hormones plus FSH and LH.   Traditionally, age-related male hormone changes were not considered problematic, because fertility in men persists until an advanced age.  Recent studies and careful evaluation in men has shown progressive changes, including:

The human body is a powerful self-healing system that is designed to be well, to regenerate, and to thrive. Unfortunately, the past model of health care contradicts this truth. Illness and disease are misrepresented as the natural state and as the inevitable result of aging, rather than as the reflection of imbalance and a hindered regenerative process. The result of this disease management system has been catastrophic to the health of our general population. Generations are disconnected from their innate healing potential and believe they must survive in disease.

One can then identify the most appropriate, effective, and least invasive method for restoring and sustaining endocrine balance. Provided with the proper physical and lifestyle support a person will respond rapidly, and normal endocrine function can return.

Protocols include lifestyle management, whole food nutritional supplements, high quality herbal supplements, and only when necessary, bioidentical hormone assistance therapy.

Younger guys are a different story.
