cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:00:52,ChristineG-ckak,Very well, thank you.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:04:17,deedee-ogag,Does anyone have a particular subject or any questions that they want to discuss?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:04:44,ChristineG-ckak,I have 2 questions, and I apologize if they are already addressed elsewhere.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:04:56,ChristineG-ckak,I have not had a chance to review all of your chat transcripts.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:05:05,BridgetA-iiai,I would like to talk about 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:05:25,deedee-ogag,No problem, we can discuss or go over anything.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:05:43,BridgetA-iiai,Oh, and also cleaning equipment afterward.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:06:05,ChristineG-ckak,Yes, that is one of my questions - how do you clean your equipment, and how do you use the 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:06:08,BridgetA-iiai,I get a lot of air in the tube and thus in me when taking the enema.  Do you have any suggestions?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:07:23,deedee-ogag,OK, for cleaning what I recommend is to rinse your system out with very warm soapy water, and then rinse.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:08:34,deedee-ogag,You can disinfect periodically with about 15-20 drops in your system and let soak for 3 hours or so, or you could just disinfect the part that goes into your body by putting the colon tube or nozzle into a basin, etc., with about 15-20 drops of 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:08:46,deedee-ogag,I would use about 5-8 drops of that in a basin or bag full of water.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:09:06,ChristineG-ckak,Excellent, thanks!
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:09:52,ChristineG-ckak,My next question is about implants that use oil - what is the best delivery system for these? I would not want to put oil in the enema tubes for fear I would never be able to clean them out.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:10:04,deedee-ogag,Bridget, do you run water through your system first a bit before putting it into your body?  And what kind of system do you currently use?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:10:29,screaming onion-woap,Is there anything that is available to shrink swollen hemorrhoids?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:11:00,BridgetA-iiai,I usually just rinse tubes in running water in the sink and now there is something dark growing in the tubes.  I have the silicone tube and long insert for inserting into the colon.  Do I need to throw away or can they be salvaged (cleaned)?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:11:59,deedee-ogag,Yes, screaming onion - S.O. for short.  You can use our 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:12:53,BridgetA-iiai,For hemorrhoids I use Forces of Nature hemorrhoid control.  It works well.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:13:10,deedee-ogag,Bridget, it is hard to get the mold out once it is in there because I do not advise bleach, but you can certainly try 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:13:56,deedee-ogag,Otherwise, I would just start over with a new tube and really try to keep it disinfected and dry.  I tell people to blow air through their hoses or colon tubes with a hair dryer, and then hang dry.  This helps to get them completely dry before storing.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:13:57,BridgetA-iiai,Okay, thanks.  I do 2 coffee enemas daily.  I should soak after each use?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:14:29,screaming onion-woap,I am not sure what you mean by Forces of Nature. Is that something that is available?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:14:43,BridgetA-iiai,Forces of Nature is the maker.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:15:20,deedee-ogag,Christine, you could use a syringe, or a syringe with a shorter tube (
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:15:34,screaming onion-woap,Do you sell the above product?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:15:43,deedee-ogag,Bridget, you could just soak once at the end of the day.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:16:57,ChristineG-ckak,Thanks!
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:17:14,deedee-ogag,I am not real familiar with that product.  Is it completely natural?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:17:37,BridgetA-iiai,Sounds good.  I need to order a couple more tubes then and keep the oil from the coffee cleaned off.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:18:32,BridgetA-iiai,Yes, its natural.  The practitioner who recommended to me had it tested in a lab for metals, purity, etc., and it's good.  You and Kristina may want to stock.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:18:50,deedee-ogag,Yes, I would use a separate tube for coffee and for oil if you use both.  This will help prevent build-up of particles from the coffee, etc.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:19:13,deedee-ogag,Thanks for the info, Bridget.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:20:00,ChristineG-ckak,Does coffee normally affect the tubes if you only take coffee enemas, say, once a week? or is it good practice to have a different tube/bag for each enema type?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:20:41,deedee-ogag,It has the same idea as the essential oil blends I make up, it looks like.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:21:24,deedee-ogag,You can use the same tubes for cleaning and for coffee.  Using coffee just discolors the tubes a bit.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:21:28,screaming onion-woap,What our the essential oils that you recommend or should I say how do I order them and by what name?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:22:30,BridgetA-iiai,What about air, Deedee?  How do I keep the air out of the tube when taking? I insert after coffee fills the insert tube but the silicone tube does not fill completely and thus air goes through.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:23:40,deedee-ogag,S.O., I use a blend of cypress, myrrh, lemon, basil, peppermint, and sometimes helichrysum and/or spikenard if I have them available.  You can just call the office and ask me for a blend of essential oils for hemorrhoids.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:23:57,deedee-ogag,You can apply it topically, or put it in a suppository.  I have a 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:24:20,deedee-ogag,Welcome, Carl.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:24:55,Carl W-ogag,Thank you, DeeDee.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:25:44,deedee-ogag,Bridget, unfortunately it is almost impossible to prevent just a little air from entering the colon when using a colon tube.  Usually, people don't even notice it.  Does it really give you problems?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:27:51,deedee-ogag,If anyone is thinking about doing a digestive/liver cleanse this month, I highly recommned our 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:27:58,deedee-ogag,It reduces toxins, improves hormonal balance, helps the body eliminate better, heals the gut, etc., and gets you on the right track for healthier eating habits.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:28:15,ChristineG-ckak,Very good idea.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:28:19,BridgetA-iiai,Maybe there are already gases present in colon,  and yes, wherever it's from, it's uncomfortable and, obviously, I'm attempting to get rid of the gas.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:28:50,BridgetA-iiai,I just did a liver/gallbladder flush.  I highly recommend like crazy.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:29:53,deedee-ogag,Yes, many times there is already gas in the colon, and introducing water can build up a lot of pressure.  Could you do a small enema to start, then sit and relieve the water and gas, and then continue with more water after you have done that?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:30:03,deedee-ogag,Rub your colon when you do this also, to push the gas out.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:30:56,deedee-ogag,Did you feel well when doing that, Bridget?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:31:00,BridgetA-iiai,Yes, I can try those.  Thanks for the suggestions.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:31:32,screaming onion-woap,Back again. What esential oils do I order for swollen hemorrhoids?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:31:34,deedee-ogag,I am assuming you did

The thing is that I have had a clean diet and habits for many years.  I was surprised at the garbage that came out and that was only the first one.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:32:12,BridgetA-iiai,Stones of all types and tons of mucus.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:32:58,deedee-ogag,S.O.,  call me at the office and just ask me for the hemorrhoid blend.  I use cypress, myrrh, lemon, basil, peppermint, and vsometimes helichrysum and/or spikenard if I have them available. 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:33:34,deedee-ogag,S.O.,  I answered you above.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:34:31,ChristineG-ckak,I have a question about colon tubes or nozzles. Is it just preference what you use, or is one supposed to be used at certain times and the other at other times?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:34:37,screaming onion-woap,By accident I deleted your message. Thanks.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:35:43,deedee-ogag,S.O.,   do you need it again?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:36:01,screaming onion-woap,Yes please.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:40:24,Carl W-ogag,OK, thanks. I am not sure if they are lowering my BP yet, since I havn't been taking them very long.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:40:26,deedee-ogag,For example, tissue damage may be healed by the essential oils more quickly and visibly, but internal issues can take a while and may need continuous support. Being able to measure the sucess does make it easier to know how effective it is, though.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:41:07,deedee-ogag,Carl, keep me posted on that one.

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:42:04,deedee-ogag,Carl, this group may not know how effective the oils have been for you.  Do you care to share the success you have had?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:43:50,deedee-ogag,Paul and slu k,  any questions or topics you'd like to discuss?
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:44:37,Carl W-ogag,I started using DeeDee's essential oil prostate blend in August last year. I was getting up to go to the bathroom about 4 or 5 times per night. Now, I only get up about 1 or 2 times per night. I am 73 years old. I believe that the essential oils made the difference.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:45:12,deedee-ogag,Thank you, Carl.  I think that is wonderful!

cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:46:40,deedee-ogag,Essential oils were used so much in ancient times to heal everything.  We have really gotten away from their healing power, but I think we are bringing it back.  People are so sick of drugs, surgeries, etc., and are looking for more natural cures.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:46:45,deedee-ogag,Welcome, James.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:48:08,deedee-ogag,Slu k, I use one or two cleansing enemas to clean out as much of the colon as I can. (Use 
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:49:22,deedee-ogag,You only want to hold them a few minutes, but get as much liquid into the colon as you can.  An implant should be done on a clean colon.  They are usually held longer (coffee for 15 minutes, or probiotics, oils, etc., for as long as you can).  These are usually healing substances that you want absorbed into your system.
cc39f8bd1e6d86315ad7359beb4903bc33d2ecbc,Healing with Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2012-1-4,13:49:54,slu k-rfaf,How often should they be taken?

Some people do daily enemas and implants for healing (illness, cancer, acute issues, etc.), and some people do them for maintenance or occasional cleaning out.  I try to do them about once per month, or so.

We do want to do some things that will help the body remove it before it does create a problem.
e5621233864a0c692e470cf04bedd4d56b5c666e,Full Body Cleanse Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-28,13:03:43,howard-ogag,Yes, that would be good, but so far it is working :) lol

This usually will do the trick, but it also depends on what else is going on.

They do tell you to eat yogurt after taking antibiotics, so they kind of get it, though usually yogurt is not enough to restore all that was killed by the antibiotics.

Some of the protocols for IBS would be herbs to heal the intestinal lining, changing the diet, and giving the body good bacteria.

e5621233864a0c692e470cf04bedd4d56b5c666e,Full Body Cleanse Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-28,13:33:24,jesser-ogag,What a neat idea!  Since unfortunately I do not have the power to lead in her treatment, I cannot presently do this.  However, knowing my genetic disposition, I might be interested in pursuing this.

There is just no money in it for them, so we have to do all of our own studies and documentation on what works with our clients and then share that info.  
e5621233864a0c692e470cf04bedd4d56b5c666e,Full Body Cleanse Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-28,13:41:50,michal-ogag,I planted ginkgo trees and make almost daily tea.

I see so many people that have first gone the medical route and have not found answers, so they are now trying the natural approach.

His question was  if anyone in the group has a post-workout regime for enemas to rehydrate the body after the workout.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:04:35,deedee-ogag,You're welcome, Joseph. Have you been able to try them out yet?

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:06:33,cwenger-lhah,OK, I could write up a more complete testimonial.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:07:15,Joseph-ogag,I had a list, but mainly for restoring flora after the antibiotics I was on.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:08:21,deedee-ogag,Joseph, I can definitely make a mixture for that.  Is the pain in a certain area, or what is the source?
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:08:30,cwenger-lhah,Do you make up suppositories to be used to relieve constipation?

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:10:18,Joseph-ogag,Sore legs, low back pain, and hip pain and inflammation in my hands, just from sports and working out and not stretching as I should.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:10:32,deedee-ogag,Yes, I would blend the oils for that.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:10:43,Joseph-ogag,Awesome.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:12:19,deedee-ogag,There are several oils that decrease inflammation, and therefore decrease pain also.  You could also use some oils topically on the spots for a more instant relief also.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:13:24,deedee-ogag,I am going to be writing more about this in the next newsletter also, but essential oils can cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore they can work much more effectively because they can get into the brain and central nervous system more readily than many things, even perscription drugs.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:14:13,Joseph-ogag,See, that makes sense, plus the blend you made for me helped with my allergies and smells wonderful!

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:15:02,deedee-ogag,Two added benefits! Great!

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:16:23,Joseph-ogag,I get a flu shot, DeeDee.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:16:33,cwenger-lhah,I have. It has been a really long time since I have had the flu. I never take flu shots.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:16:36,deedee-ogag,, we will be so much farther ahead than those who wait to treat just the symptoms once they get sick.

It is such a personal choice and everyone has their own reasons for doing or not doing it. It is good to get both perspectives, though.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:18:36,deedee-ogag,We have a sunny, crisp, cold day here today.   How is it by you two?
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:18:59,Joseph-ogag,I would love to defend against it naturally, but it is a habit since I've had asthma all my life.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:19:13,cwenger-lhah,It is a miserable rainy day as it was yesterday.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:19:16,Joseph-ogag,But I've been doing well this season, thank goodness.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:19:18,deedee-ogag,Joseph, do you get pain and stiffness at night in bed also?
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:19:32,Joseph-ogag,Cloudy and cold here  in Chicago.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:20:03,Joseph-ogag,Most definitely, DeeDee. More so upon waking, though.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:20:20,deedee-ogag,Yes, asthma does make it a little more complicated.  Have you been able to decrease your asthma symptoms with enemas and natural approaches to your health?
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:21:50,deedee-ogag,Joseph, you know what really works well for me, especially in the colder months?  I make this wonderful heating bag that I heat in the microwave and then take to bed with me or use when I am watching TV, etc.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:22:27,Joseph-ogag,Oh yes, I've reduced symptoms mostly with trying to stay active. I use enemas when I feel a cold coming on.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:22:39,deedee-ogag,I put some essential oils on the sore spots, put the heating bag on, and it takes the pain  away so well. It is amazing!  I use this on my stomach for stomach aches as well.  I could make you one up if you'd like.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:22:47,Joseph-ogag,That's a great idea. DeeDee. Thank you. I will do that tonight when I get home from work.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:23:31,Joseph-ogag,I have a water bottle and one of those rice neck bags.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:24:12,deedee-ogag,The bag is made from soft material and has rice and essential oils/herbs in it.  It heats well and holds its heat.  It can also be put into the freezer for when you need a cold pack.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:24:28,deedee-ogag,Yes, that is great!

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:33:36,cwenger-lhah,Yes, I had 2 additional

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:35:11,deedee-ogag,That is great, does she know of us up here?
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:35:43,cwenger-lhah,I did tell her about you.
53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:36:59,deedee-ogag,Well, I am glad that she knows the benefits and is willing to provide them.

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:38:50,deedee-ogag,No, that time frame is fine.  Do you know how long you will do that?

53ab9a4834f8513ff7ec9e5ccae0859d324ec489,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-12-7,13:41:37,deedee-ogag,Sounds great!  Keep me posted on how you feel and how it is going.  Maybe you can share some of the details with the group also.

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:06:34,kristina-iiai,What's on your minds tonight?
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:06:52,kristina-iiai,Nope, the snow has stopped. It has been a lovely day!

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:07:20,kristina-iiai,And, there is a beautiful, near full moon out tonight.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:07:39,Larry-rfaf,Going to be cold by morning!

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:08:58,Larry-rfaf,Question on using the bifidonate powder.  How much product and water for an implant?
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:09:09,kristina-iiai,One subject I'd like to talk about tonight is 
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:09:37,randyu-ogag,Yes I have, with alternate

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:10:35,kristina-iiai,4 billion colony forming units or 1 teaspoon of powder with one cup of water. Hold solution as long as possible, including all night.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:11:00,Larry-rfaf,Thanks.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:11:11,kristina-iiai,Randy, are  you willing to share the details of your IBS and how you support your body?
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:11:44,kristina-iiai,Constipation is hard on us. In the U.S., laxatives and stool softeners are the two biggest selling medications, 2nd only to pain relievers. Constipation is quite common in our modern world for people of all ages.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:12:51,randyu-ogag,I take Benefiber tabs every day; this helps; drink water; exercise.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:12:58,kristina-iiai,So is colon cancer. In fact, colon cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the United States. Many scientific studies have shown that there is an increased risk of colon cancer in people who are chronically constipated.  The connection between bowel disease and constipation seems to be related to the fact that constipation dramatically increases what is called the bowel transit time, or the time that it takes food to go from the mouth, through the digestive system and out as stool as a so called "bowel movement."
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:13:07,randyu-ogag,Some meds can help too.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:13:33,kristina-iiai,How often do you take 
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:14:03,kristina-iiai,The National Institute of Health reports that the "normal" range of bowel movements in a week ranges from 3 to 21.  This range shows just how extremely constipated many of us are.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:14:10,randyu-ogag,Occasionally not very often; only if really bad.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:14:28,kristina-iiai,At the extreme ends of this "normal range" you have bowel transit times ranging from 8 to 56 hours! Among most natural health practitioners, it is felt that the optimal bowel transit time is between 12 and 18 hours.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:14:47,kristina-iiai,Slow bowel transit times raise the risk of colon diseases and contribute to health problems in part by increasing the amount of time that the colon content is available for re-absorption into the body.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:16:18,kristina-iiai,Benefiber is wheat dextrin so I wouldn't recommend it generally.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:16:35,kristina-iiai,Have you tried any other fiber products?

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:18:11,randyu-ogag,IBS is hard to lick; stubborn.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:18:28,JoanS-rfaf,Hi there... I have similar concerns - extremely slow bowel transit.  That's why I've turned to home enemas.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:18:45,randyu-ogag,What do you think of the Fleet mineral oil or aloe vera enemas?
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:19:27,kristina-iiai,I hope you don't mind me talking more about the Benefiber. I am not criticizing your choice. I just want to explore the details here.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:19:41,kristina-iiai,So, dextrin is a hydrolyzed starch made from various starches such as potato, corn, tapioca, rice, arrowroot or wheat. Wheat starch is a byproduct from extracting gluten from wheat. The wheat starch is sprayed with acid while being agitated and then suspended in water by the acids or enzymes. After maturing, the wheat starch is dried in a roaster where it is continually heated and stirred. The converted dextrin is then taken from the roaster and cooled. It is humidified before packing to keep the dextrin from getting lumpy or foaming. Heating times and acids vary depending upon the manufacturer and the final product usage.

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:21:43,randyu-ogag,What about my question on Fleets?
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:21:54,Larry-rfaf,I have another probiotic question.  Since I'm taking an oral probiotic in the morning and evening, can the use of a probiotic implant be excessive?

Wheat dextrin is in fact a by-product of extracting the gluten from wheat but complete extraction is not guaranteed. Individuals who are gluten-intolerant should avoid wheat dextrin.

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:25:47,kristina-iiai,Why are you taking the implants?
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:25:58,JoanS-rfaf,I've struggled with constipation for many, many years.  It seems like a product works in the beginning (fiber powders, magnesium citrate, cape aloe, other herbs) but eventually they stop working.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:26:40,kristina-iiai,That is a very common experience, Joan, because those products often don't get at the cause of the constipation.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:27:12,randyu-ogag,Joan is right, they only work for a while; then the cycle stars over again.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:27:35,kristina-iiai,Finishing up on my notes about constipation from above (read the archive if you missed it): Like all mucous membranes, the interior surface of the colon is able to absorb certain substances. The longer food and microbial waste sit in contact with the colon wall the more opportunity there is for stagnation, purification and re-absorption of these wastes. It is also known that stool often contains many carcinogenic materials that when remain in contact with the colon wall promote cancer of the colon.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:27:45,JoanS-rfaf,I believe it's probably food sensitivities for me, but I'm still trying to figure them out.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:29:14,randyu-ogag,Foods are the culprit for me too.  Some will trigger symptoms and cause

I use only 10 to 12 ounces of water with H2O2.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:32:07,kristina-iiai,And, Joan, how is it going using 
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:32:09,randyu-ogag,Asparagus, chili, greasy stuff; all things I love to eat.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:32:42,kristina-iiai,I have not heard before of someone being sensitive to asparagus. What happens when you eat it?
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:33:19,randyu-ogag,The canned asparagus is what gets me... makes me go.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:34:09,randyu-ogag,PH is right - some of us don't need to use much water in enemas; maybe a pint to a quart.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:34:40,kristina-iiai,I bet fresh stuff would work for you. I would always avoid canned vegetables.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:34:58,JoanS-rfaf,Enemas are really helping me.  I'm only having time to do it once a week.  I'm trying to keep wheat out of my diet.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:35:07,randyu-ogag,Salads and dressings will get me too; balsamic vinaigrette is great but the seeds are a laxative.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:36:10,kristina-iiai,Yes, again, with the essential oil suppositories we are finding that some people do better

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:37:29,randyu-ogag,Yes, some doctors recommend suppositories first before enemas.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:38:56,kristina-iiai,A good read on gluten sensitivities:

e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:39:50,kristina-iiai,You are very welcome, Joan. Thanks for joining us.

I think they are fine to use when necessary - when in a pinch.
e398891239807a43e9d5c7e60a69927bfc653599,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-11-9,20:41:06,kristina-iiai,Good night, Randy.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:08:34,deedee-ogag,The ancient Chinese practice, practiced by monks, is called Chi Nei Tsang and it is very promising for those with

Chi Nei Tsang involves the application of Chi-Kung in the manual treatment of the viscera (Nei-Tsang) and the deepest internal structures of the body.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:10:38,deedee-ogag,I will explore the abdomen, mapping the tensions that are in the tissues. The work is mostly gentle, and the touch is soft, although it can be deep.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:11:12,howard-ogag,Especially with the nurse since I was on Cumadin to continue taking herbal vitamin and Omega3 and more importly the herbal tea and sesame oil and to recheck to INR on a weekly schedule (at least for now).

The colon absorbs the healing oils into the system and they work on whatever health problem you are having.  They also work well on the skin, orally, and as aromatherapy.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:24:40,renae j-lhah,May have parasites.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:25:27,deedee-ogag,Renae, first I would do a cleansing enema using 
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:26:18,stu k-rfaf,How much sea salt should you put in the enema?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:27:05,deedee-ogag,For parasites, lemongrass, tarragon, anise, Idaho tansy, basil, peppermint, ginger, nutmeg, tea tree and rosemary, to name a few.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:28:09,deedee-ogag,Larry, the one we use is 
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:28:33,deedee-ogag,Stu - you would use 1 teaspoon of sea salt per quart of warm water.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:28:35,Larry-rfaf,Thanks.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:29:44,deedee-ogag,Howard, why don't you tell the group about your experience with the flu and what happened.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:29:44,Larry-rfaf,FYI on the salt... I had to cut back 50% as I was starting to get headaches with the standard amount.  Don't know why, but it worked.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:29:47,Charla D.-fjaj,I have been buying coconut milk and drinking it.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:30:15,deedee-ogag,A client of mine said his wife got the flu and she got the flu shot.  He did not get the shot and did not get the flu!
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:30:36,Charla D.-fjaj,So you don't recommend flu shots then?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:31:01,deedee-ogag,Charla, coconut milk is excellent.  So is the water and the oil.  You can't go wrong with it.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:31:03,Charla D.-fjaj,I didn't get one last year because of a clinic I went to last year.

We just want you to have all the info and be able to make a knowledgeable decision for yourself.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:32:20,Charla D.-fjaj,I know I need more water to drink, but what happens or what should you add to it to get past this time?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:32:23,Larry-rfaf,I got the flu shot but it does take a period of time after the shot to fully develop protection.  Even though I believe in the shot, I have a friend with a very bad experience from the shot.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:33:12,Charla D.-fjaj,Always seems when my system is slightly toxic that water doesn't taste that great or I have to force myself to stay with it and not drink other things.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:33:49,Charla D.-fjaj,Lately I have been feeling really sluggish and tired.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:33:59,Larry-rfaf,He's in his 80's and was paralyzed in all 4 limbs for several days.  He now has a long road of PT to recover.  Now he's developed a massive dose of shingles.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:34:17,randyu-ogag,Thanks, DeeDee. Have a good day!!

You could also add a little Stevia to it to make it taste sweeter.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:34:44,randyu-ogag,Signing off now.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:35:21,Charla D.-fjaj,That sounds good with the essential oils added.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:35:39,deedee-ogag,Adding in one of the citrus oils makes it taste great and gives you nutrients too.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:35:43,Charla D.-fjaj,Really thanks, Stu.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:35:52,Charla D.-fjaj,I have one I need to use.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:36:06,Charla D.-fjaj,Is that citrus essential oil?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:36:08,deedee-ogag,Yes, definitely use filtered or spring water - no tap water.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:36:40,deedee-ogag,Yes, we use 
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:36:47,Charla D.-fjaj,OK, thanks. I have lots of acid reflux at times... and have to take a pill for it. Any ideas for calming it?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:38:00,stu k-rfaf,I have the same problem.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:38:05,deedee-ogag,Yes, if you do happen to get the flu or a cold, doing a week of enemas really makes you feel better a lot quicker and takes the intensity and duration down.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:38:05,Maryam-ogag,Is there a specific topic being covered today?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:38:21,Charla D.-fjaj,My allergy doctor says to take the pills and it calms my asthma when I have it.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:39:24,deedee-ogag,Charla, yes, definitely!  Pills for acid reflux actually inhibit digestion and create more digestive issues down the road.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:39:46,deedee-ogag,It is better to talk one-on-one about everything so I can make a better recommendation, but I would probably get you on enzymes,

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:43:28,Charla D.-fjaj,I took a series of IVs last year at this time... h2o peroxide ones... Helps me lots.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:44:00,deedee-ogag,Charla, what do you take them for?  What does it help specifically?

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:48:44,deedee-ogag,Does the cyst affect your elimination of urine right now?  What kind of cyst is it?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:49:46,deedee-ogag,You send the hair sample here per instructions on the kit and we then send it to our lab that we work with  - Analytical Research Labs.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:50:16,Maryam-ogag,No not at all! Not sure of the type.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:50:30,Charla D.-fjaj,Thanks.

The kidneys, or at least one of them, need to be in good working order because of the fluids that may be absorbed and eliminated during the process.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:52:24,deedee-ogag,Maryam, some essentail oils that could be beneficial to the kidney are juniper, geranium, grapefruit, and lemon.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:53:29,deedee-ogag,Michal - did you have anything to ask or add?

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:55:13,michal-ogag,To be sure that it is a cyst and not an abscess or a tumor, like RENOMA.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:55:31,deedee-ogag,Have you had that, Maryam?

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:58:16,cristinag-fjaj,I just started taking an iron supplement and they cause serious constipation. Suggestions?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:58:28,Charla D.-fjaj,What do you do when your whole body feels really dry and you drink and it still seems to feel that way?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:58:52,deedee-ogag,Yes, the eating plan and the cleansing part would be fine.  I think I'd like to evaluate before the fasting part, though. 
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,13:59:07,Charla D.-fjaj,I have not ever done the fasting part

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,14:00:32,Charla D.-fjaj,I use the calm formula.

5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,14:00:46,Charla D.-fjaj,What is your reacted magnesium? Is it better?
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,14:00:46,michal-ogag,Long, long ago, in a country far, far away they were giving lots of enemas for many ailments and diseases. In hospitals, in clinics, at homes.
5d56ac03d02847127b226443708269e0d3dfb0db,Essential Oil Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-10-26,14:01:04,Maryam-ogag,OK.

I am impressed that Rick drinks all of that juice every day!  I tried that for a long time but found green smoothies to be better for me.  The only dilemma I have with Dr. Walker's books (they're GREAT!) is that he recommends drinking distilled water.

Once enough water is in the colon, you then expel it, along with the resulting waste, into the toilet. You then repeat the process one or two more times.

You want to take in as much as one gallon of water during one of the enemas in a series and you want to take three in a row and you want to use an essential oil in the second enema.

Assisting the water to easily leave the colon is another function of the essential oil. Also, use a high quality sea salt, like

I find colonics easier because I don't have to keep getting up.  I do hold the water in during a colonic but am concerned putting too much in during an enema that doesn't come out as fast.  Does that make sense?

Price, who studied the diets of fourteen traditional societies during the 1930s and 1940s. His goal was to understand what makes human beings healthy and what allows them to have perfect teeth. The food Kristina recommends to readers are the traditional foods that gave health to the populations that Price researched. And, the diet is gluten-free!

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:04:56,deedee-ogag,I believe a strong immune system is the secret to not getting the flu since we are all going to be exposed and we don't know what strain we will be exposed to
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:05:07,deedee-ogag, and many flu shots do not seem to contain the strain that you may be exposed to, so you never can be sure you are vaccinating for the correct bug.

Wondering if you might touch on the connection between hormone balance/imbalance (and resulting depression) and colon health?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:13:40,Larry-rfaf,Would the probiotic degrade in a suppository if made ahead of time and stored in the fridge?

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:15:10,Joseph-ogag,Yes, I would just like to ask about how to restore good bacteria in the system... especially after a dose of antibiotics...
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:16:09,deedee-ogag,Hormone imbalance is very common, believe it or not.  Depression many times is misdiagnosed and it is really thyroid issues which are connected to 
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:16:55,Andrea B.-fjaj,28 years is too early to have a session of colon hydrotherapy, or is the right age?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:17:25,deedee-ogag,Colon cleansing can be used as part of a protocol for hormonal health because the liver processes the excessive hormones in the body, so the liver has to be healthy and the liver relies on the colon to process its waste,
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:17:54,deedee-ogag,so a clean colon will assist with the detoxifiying process of the body trying to process the hormones more efficiently.  Does that kind of answer your question?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:18:27,Susan B.-iiai,Yes, precisely. That's where my mind was headed, thanks for confirming.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:18:47,Susan B.-iiai,What else can I do to help my lazy liver?

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:19:04,deedee-ogag,Andrea, 28 yrs. old is not too early.  With the diets that we have and the toxic exposure, plus the fact that we don't all have 2 - 3 bowel movements a day, means that our colons need some help just like our teeth need to be cleaned periodically.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:19:21,deedee-ogag,You were thinking correctly, Susan!

The Vit-Ra-Tox is harder for some to do because it is a 5 to 7 day fast.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:26:58,deedee-ogag,Core Restore also teaches people how to eat more healthy since it gives you categories and types of foods to eat that can be carried over after the cleanse.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:27:59,Andrea B.-fjaj,DeeDee, for my cleansing I use two or three enemas about every two weeks, but after a few days I still feel bloated. The

I also used DeeDee's recommendation for the coconut oil suppositories.  I had a very serious infection problem from a spider bite and was on massive antibiotics.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:30:03,deedee-ogag,Yes, it may be useful, but it sounds like you do a pretty good job at home.  It may be more to do with your diet - food allergies, digestive system not working in general.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:30:07,deedee-ogag,You may find the Core Restore helpful, but we can dig into more specifics if you want to.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:33:53,Susan B.-iiai,I did once and was very sick afterwards. I'd rather take my chances now!
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:34:15,Larry-rfaf,I get one every year and have for 30 years.  The only year I missed... I got the flu!  Even with my new approach to health, I'll likely stay with the flu shot.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:35:08,deedee-ogag,Ssusan, another question regarding hormones: Have you ever had your hormones tested? - because we do offer perimenopausal testing if you want to know what is going on, and I would also highly recommend 
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:36:08,deedee-ogag,Larry, I think that is the case with some people. They have always gotten them and feel safer getting them - I feel the same way - only opposite!
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:36:36,Susan B.-iiai,Well, I've done part of the above. I have no income and very limited resources so I did a hair analysis, cortisol panel, and just one estrogen measurement. Waiting for the results back from you folks any day now...
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:37:41,deedee-ogag,I have also heard of people having a reaction to the shot and feeling like they actually get the flu after they have gotten the shot  - I just think we do not know enough about all of the situations surrounding the vaccine.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:37:44,Joseph-ogag,Ah, very good, Larry. Thank you. I think that is probably the best way to take a series.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:46:11,Andrea B.-fjaj,No, constipated no, but some gas.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:46:58,Larry-rfaf,After much use, I've noticed a white deposit forming on the inside of my silicone hose.  Does this serve to inhibit bacteria growth or should I be concerned about cleaning it out?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:47:23,deedee-ogag,Can you pinpoint what causes the gas for you?  Does it occur constantly and is it really foul-smelling or uncomfortable?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:48:18,deedee-ogag,Larry, I am not sure what caused that.  Is it salt or mineral deposit, or what does it look like?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:48:45,Andrea B.-fjaj,When I get up very early in the morning.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:50:56,Larry-rfaf,It could be salt or soap? I do rinse very well after use and have soaked it in a weak bleach solution.  It will come out using mechanical means but it's a lot of work.  It's a light white coating.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:52:07,deedee-ogag,It is probably mineral deposit - maybe soap residue, and as long as you disinfect (don't use bleach!), it should be fine.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:52:53,Joseph-ogag,No bleach?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:53:27,Larry-rfaf,Well... I was out of

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:53:57,Andrea B.-fjaj,I don't eat before bed.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:54:55,deedee-ogag,Andrea, try eating protein right before bed. This will stabilize blood sugar through the night and stabilize the digestive system.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:55:51,deedee-ogag,I forgive you, Larry. You have a pass this time.

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:56:54,Larry-rfaf,Hmmm... The last time I had a couple of hard boiled eggs and a couple of beers before going to bed... well... it didn't work out too well! ;) 
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:57:10,deedee-ogag,You only want to eat a small amount of protein which actually stabilizes blood sugar and helps the adrenals.  Just a small amount.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:57:25,Joseph-ogag,But you got your, protein Larry. lol

6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:58:17,Andrea B.-fjaj,OK, DeeDee, but a colonic session is recommended?
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:59:24,deedee-ogag,Yes, a colonic would be good.  You could then see what is going on and hopefully the colon therapist would be able to give you some good feedback on what she sees.  We can always consult afterwards also, it they do not seem to have good info for you.
6f78cfa44a84c7b61927a79f58262f21731b0f24,Enema Solutions and Detox Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-28,13:59:37,Larry-rfaf,Thank you, everyone, for another good session.  Catch you next month.  Go Pack Go!!

Personal experiences of what work are often our best teachers when it comes to taking care of ourselves.

I am in robust health, but I have always needed to help my system a bit, and have used enemas for this and general health. Sometimes my stomach or colon just feels a little raw, and needs something soothing.

24e10e6ab38a6edaa375f5abb721cd52cb8157df,Therapeutic Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-14,20:21:03,kristina-iiai,Yes, if you are using regular enemas, take a daily probiotic. No matter how good your health is.

(I believe this is one reason why taking enema to avoid and alleviate flus is such a useful technique.)
24e10e6ab38a6edaa375f5abb721cd52cb8157df,Therapeutic Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-9-14,20:33:00,Dave-ueae,By weekly, do you mean a "good" enema or at least 2?

I have found that when, per your suggestion, I add a small amount of salt to my enema solution, I don't get cramps. This really amazed me. I was avoiding salt because I have high blood pressure.

MSM would be absorbed effectively into the system and could bypass the digestive system.

Oils are also very useful in implants and suppositories because they are meant to stay in the colon longer, which gives them time to absorb.

Also, coconut oils are excellent to give energy during the fast and are also good for the thyroid, to tie the two subjects together.  It is also antimicrobial!

My mother started with me at age 8. It was done in a slow and careful way so I wouldn't dread the procedure.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:22:49,deedee-ogag,Epsom salts have to be used more cautiously.  It is very purging in nature and too much can be harmful.  One tablespoon in 2 quarts is all you want to use.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:22:55,Dave-ueae,Has salt-soda replaced soap as best enema ingredient?

If they have no issues, I would not necessarily introduce them.  I would also be careful around puberty time.  This seems to create lasting
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:26:10,deedee-ogag,impressions, some that may be negative.  Anywhere between infant and 10 yrs. old would be fine, again if the child needs help.  I do not think I would do it on a regular basis otherwise.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:26:25,deedee-ogag,Done in a very gentle and understanding way, and never making the child feel as if it were a punishment or discipline.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:27:23,Dave-ueae,I think enemas have largely been an as-needed therapy, esprecially for kids.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:27:53,deedee-ogag,PH, purified water is great and filtered is fine too.  Anything that brings the water closest to its natural state.  I think spring water fits into that category because it has its minerals, but not the toxic elements and additives, etc.

That is why the essential oils and herbs have really interested me.

e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:34:24,Larry-rfaf,I viewed the video you were shooting on my last visit... runner and his dog.  You left out the comments he made about the benefits to his dog.  Very amazing!
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:35:22,deedee-ogag,Plain water can be fine for one enema, but it is hypotonic which means there is lower pressure than intracellular fluid.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:36:29,deedee-ogag,This can throw off electrolyte balance if used often.

He was told his dog only had two months to live - that was five months ago, yeah!!  He will probably talk about that more later on.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:37:35,randyu-ogag,Thanks DeeDee, for that info about plain water.

e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:39:01,Dave-ueae,for hydration?

He brings the dog in to do FIR saunas, and he is also on several supplements.  He has a brain tumor and it was causing him not to be able to walk, etc.  The dog is 14 yrs. old, and they said his only option for keeping

Drink half of your body weight in water in ounces  (100 lb. person drink 50 oz. daily).  IF you excerise or are outside for periods of time, or drink dehydrating liquids such as

They both can work very well separately, but put them together, and it makes a high, thorough enema much more possible and comfortable.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:51:20,deedee-ogag,The colon tube starts the water up higher so you avoid that need to purge right away (passes the part with more nerve endings) and the pump then delivers the water so efficiently.
e08c5fac02153e5a3301ff5d254f238873020a08,Fasting and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-7-27,13:51:40,deedee-ogag,It works like a charm and many clients tell me they can hardly feel the pressure and cannot believe how much water they were able to take in so comfortably.

They were very unrehearsed and kind of raw, but hopefully got the information out.

It seemed to work but am not sure if it did the job or not, if you know what I mean. I bought an enema kit but haven't started that yet as I had some intestinal problems due to some antiobiotics I took...

Being the curious guy that I am, I'm trying to read everything I can on the supps.  What is in the REAL and why does it work?

First I just use 48 oz. of plain distilled water at 100 degrees and a gentle massage empties me out within 5 minutes... then within 15 minutes I use 32 oz. of distilled water at 100 degrees with a teaspoon of Celtic sea salt (dissolved) and 4 drops of lavender oil, which I hold for 20 minutes... This last recipe requires a lot of massage to get the peristalsis going.... Do you suggest anything else?

I have it from many medical doctors that water washes (enemas) are always a better choice than laxatives.

DeeDee has also discovered a method where you use coconut oil in ice cube trays with the essential oils. Free the tray full of implants and use them as suppositories.

We find a couple of day's worth of cleansing with a series of enemas and fasting will get you through so you don't have to take medication.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:33:55,Dave-ueae,A star is  born!

931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:36:09,DerekJ-ogag,It's an mp3.

Some doctors will send you home if you tell them that you did enemas and did not take the meds. so sometimes you can't tell them unfortunately.  Do 2 days of fasting and cleansing with a series of 3 enemas per day.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:37:36,DerekJ-ogag,Dennis, do they want you to chug a gallon of the "Golitely" stuff?

He thinks enemas are good for us. I heard him talk about it. It would surely help many people with this sometimes misunderstond subject. Let the boss know. Make sure you e-mail if ever you go on TV.

This has always worked well for all I've worked with.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:45:06,DerekJ-ogag,I know a little olive oil in the solution really gets things moving for me.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:45:26,deedee-ogag,I have not had my first colonoscopy yet.  When I do, I will be taking the natural approach.  The drink they give you is hard on the kidneys and nervous system, and getting the stuff out of your system afterwards is important too.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:45:26,DerekJ-ogag,Sounds like solid advice there, Dennis

931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:47:22,DerekJ-ogag,DeeDee, something my CT had me do was put castor oil on my stomach before my session to help "detox." Not sure if that is any benefit.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:47:32,dennisr-lhah,I've decided to fast with liquids only 2 days before the test and enemas twice a day each day. I agree with you, DeeDee, that these so called doctors don't understand that there are other ways of handling something like this. I will sure let everyone know in August.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:47:59,DerekJ-ogag,What are they looking for, Dennis?

931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:48:31,DerekJ-ogag,OK, good to know. Thanks, DeeDee.

931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:52:58,dennisr-lhah,This is my first TOTAL  inspection of my colon. I have NO problems with anything. Doctor just want to make sure I`m O.K. at 71 yrs old. I'll bet him, I have NO polyps or abnormal problems. I'm taking enemas now for 63 years.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:53:18,deedee-ogag,The white delrin nozzles are smaller and very smooth, so they actually are less irritating than the ones that have side holes.  Of course, you still need to be very careful when inserting.
931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:53:33,DerekJ-ogag,Yeah, I would be shocked if they found anything.

931a425540e17ffd9cfa6ee9e9104cd592524dcb,Enemas and Colon Tubes Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-22,13:54:41,deedee-ogag,I do not have constipation issues, so I would rely on the feedback I get from my clients.  Of course everyone is so different, so what works for one person may not for the next person.

Let's get that peristalsis working again without the use of the stimulating herbs that you can only use briefly.

Then when I get it up that far, I let a little trickle of water go in and I work the colon tube up farther, but slowly.

Sometimes you have to slide up and down and change positions of your body too can help.

38e3e75909e08601db1d5e1b6b3c27abadbf6d35,Colon Health Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-6-8,20:17:41,kristina-iiai,Different things cause irritation to the gut for different people. The list includes

I've heard of a couple of places on the web, but it seems that they are a little weird.

My voice gets raspy when my thyroid hormones are low (hypothyroid).  But, if my adrenal can't handle the increase in thyroid, I can't take thyroid meds/supplements until the adrenals are stronger.

It is all natural - Premier labs.  Very good stuff - but I could not handle the feeling that I was feeling so deeply and seriously about trivial things and...

This is something I know nothing about.  Is this in your book, Kristina?  I bought it and have read parts and scanned it through...

I pretty much just eat whatever because I get so tired of being allergic to so many foods.  I have cut out meats a lot.  That makes me feel better.

Truthfully, you can't have struggles in one part of the body without those imbalances, inflammation, or overload effecting EVERY OTHER part of the body.

I have been doing a lot of research lately about the colon and my liver and how you will crave the stuff that your body is allergic to... My friends kid me - and tell me to go to medical school.

What I am hoping to accomplish here is - well first I want to buy a better enema system - is to feel the health benefits from the enemas so much that I am encouraged to not eat the bad stuff.

8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837,Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-5-11,20:41:45,Sarah C-lhah,I have a kit and I buy the capsules and the herbs.  My 12-year-old makes them too.

8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837,Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-5-11,20:43:21,kristina-iiai,Gotu kola makes you have to sleep a lot?

I was taking that "silver" and I would become overwhelmingly dizzy.  I had to not take it.  Just a few drops and I would have to lie down.

8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837,Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-5-11,20:46:42,randyu-ogag,What was wrong, Kristina?

8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837,Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-5-11,20:47:04,Sarah C-lhah,Yes - I'm waiting to hear more Kristina.

Fresh juicing without fiber is supposed to get the nutrients into the system more quickly, as it doesn't have to be digested.  So, that would be the same for liquid herbals, I would think.
8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837,Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-5-11,20:49:27,Sarah C-lhah,So with your practices now - you are keeping all this under control?  Kristina - are you the doctor on all the videos?

Turns out, I have a severe caffience allergy. I even had to give up kombucha!

It is inspiring, especially because I have many of the same issues you have dealt with.  That is helpful to hear about new issues cropping up, AND about tending your body rigorously.
8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837,Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-5-11,20:52:26,kristina-iiai,Cascara sagrada, an herb from a tree, can stain the walls of the colon.

I LOVE kombucha, and can tolerate it, I think, even though I don't tolerate caffeine well.  Actually, as my health has improved, I can periodically have a cup of black tea without the nervousness.  
8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837,Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-5-11,20:53:51,Sarah C-lhah,OK, I see - I wonder if that was why the doc was so irritated!!  It did feel like I was never finished going to the bathroom.  But a lot of my stomach issues seemed to dissipate and I was losing weight...

I was prescribed synthetic ginseng - euleorthra root or something and did not tolerate that at all.

I think the tending the body issue is really key.  That's just not very societally acceptable, really.  But it's so important to listen to our body and heed its call for help.
8cdb22a18fe0c161b297e94dc1439c392a151837,Adrenal Health and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-5-11,20:56:33,kristina-iiai,Sarah, call and talk to DeeDee. She can help you out. I don't think using the kombucha for that purpose is a good idea but you can certainly try it. If you like it, it does help with immunity and improving the healthy balance of intestinal flora.

Then, we would work with them over some months through the Optimal Health Center and we could follow their progress on YouTube. If you or anyone you know is interested, I would offer free consults and supplements at cost.

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:05:54,Alan D-ogag,I have been taking the Miralax 3 times a day. My problems are from many meds I take for back pain.

But, first of all, I want to thank you for your excellent website and all the information.  It is really helpful and gives one hope!
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:07:16,deedee-ogag,Thank you, Heather.  Ask any questions that you have.

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:09:46,deedee-ogag,Yes, sometimes diet changes can make things worse. Can you determine specifically what about the diet you think is causing the most problems for you?
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:10:21,Heather-lhah,My gut (no gas/bloating anymore, and less gurgling) is better.  But I've had to use enemas about every 2-3 days.  I wanted the slant board, but don't think will fit in my bathroom, so started with your $8.50 
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:11:35,Alan D-ogag,Someone has suggested to me that I take a daily enema, but would that be too often?
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:11:35,deedee-ogag,Alan, it looks like we have to start internally then with reacted magnesium and some herbs, and topical oils, etc. to heal that area a little more so that you can do some enemas.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:12:28,deedee-ogag,How are the enemas going so far, Heather?  Do you feel you are cleaning out well enough?  Are you having bowel movements between cleansings?
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:12:32,Heather-lhah,Now I'm trying to decide on which enema kit to purchase and what nozzle.   Questions are:  1) How much

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:13:37,Heather-lhah,The enemas are going well.  I'm able to take about 1-2 quarts with each successive one and I feel like I'm cleaning out pretty well.  But, no BMs between cleansings.  I had cut out most supplements, but my MD, using energy, has me on a lot of supplements.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:14:12,Alan D-ogag,I did get a script to help with the fissure - Diltiazem gel.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:14:15,deedee-ogag,That is a perfect amount of GSE.  You only need to soak about 3 - 4 hours, but overnight is OK.  Do you just soak the nozzle or the whole kit and are you doing it every time?
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:15:06,Heather-lhah,Now I'm coming off some long-term medications (prozac, clonazepam) under her care, and she sensed I need a boost in nutrition.  But, I'd love to get the nutrition from food - that will happen.  Maybe I'm still not eating enough fat.  But, trying.

I think I moved too quickly from those to solid foods, or that's my MD's thinking.  Not sure how to answer.... 
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:18:29,gleener-lhah,Joseph,  have  you  been  taking for  a  long  time?

The first attempts were no fun, but now I have the hang of it. Yesterday I did a high enema as the #3 and was able to retain it for a long time (1 hour) then emptied a small portion.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:19:57,deedee-ogag,I was just wondering if you were doing the basics like probiotics and enzymes.

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:23:59,deedee-ogag,If the enema is a cleansing enema, hold it no more than ten minutes.  If it is an implant like coffee or aloe juice/olive oil, or probiotics, those you can hold for longer periods of time.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:24:26,Heather-lhah,I have been on probiotics and digestive enzymes for awhile.  I'm sticking with the Enzymedica Digest Gold, but my MD switched me from the Biolkult to something called Perque Digesta Guard Forte.

a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:28:50,deedee-ogag,Heather, doing enemas will help to tone the colon and should help transit time along with the enzymes and probiotics, but sometimes people use herbs such as fenugreek and chamomile to help transit time.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:30:21,gleener-lhah,Joseph try letting in a cup of the water to open those valves.

You may need to switch positions a little also to get a better angle.
a32702f48c7cf5ab39fd40e89da859b404a5aedb,Constipation and Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-4-27,13:30:36,Heather-lhah,I think I have had gas and bloating for so many years that perhaps got the peristalsis going, and now that I no longer have gas/bloating, it may just take time to retrain my body's peristalsis.  Do they take fenugreek and chamomile in the enema or orally?

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:04:52,Dave-ueae,Interesting thing in today's local paper: 4 page section on colorectal cancer. Might this be on the increase? Didn't hear much mention back when enemas and other colon care was routine. 
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:04:54,randyu-ogag,Can I ask a question that pertains only to me?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:05:39,michael b.-ckak,Happy spring - here is hoping great health to all here.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:06:29,Dave-ueae,Yes, a good one.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:06:55,deedee-ogag,Dave, I think you are right.  Colon cancer is probably on the rise due to the increase in our poor diets and people being told it is OK if you only go to the bathroom every third day
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:07:08,deedee-ogag,Randy, you can ask any question you want.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:08:40,deedee-ogag,Recently a client sent me an e-mail regarding an interview she saw between Suzanne Somers and Dr. Nancy Snyderman, who is on the NBC Today Show a lot as their medical specialist.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:08:42,randyu-ogag,I have

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:10:45,deedee-ogag,There was also Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez who says he recommends to his cancer patients to take a couple of

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:12:31,Dave-ueae,People are starting to look at alternatives, which ironically was standard operating procedure years ago.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:12:49,deedee-ogag,Randy, I can also help you to come off of medication and to heal that IBS.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:13:24,randyu-ogag,Yes, DeeDee, what about proper equipment?  Should I have someone else help give the enema to me? I have not had one in many years.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:13:42,deedee-ogag,Yes, people are finally starting to talk about alternative health practices. (We say alternative, but they were so mainstream so many years ago.)
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:14:31,deedee-ogag,Randy, if you have someone willing to give the enema to you, that is great, and can be relaxing, but if you don't, you can definitely do it yourself with a little practice.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:15:00,deedee-ogag,Randy, you can call me here at the center, and I will help you pick out enema equipment.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:15:51,Dave-ueae,Yes, sight of a bag or enema can stored  on a bathroom door was almost routine.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:16:03,deedee-ogag,I have a great new healing way to do suppositories.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:16:06,randyu-ogag,Yes I would like to come off meds. I will give a call, DeeDee. 
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:16:32,deedee-ogag,Great, Randy. Look forward to talking with you.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:17:35,randyu-ogag,Suppositories work, but glycerin has side effects.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:17:52,randyu-ogag,DeeDee, when is a good time to call you?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:17:56,deedee-ogag,I have done these healing suppositories on myself and have been giving others the recipes and oils/herbs to do them and, wow!  do they work nicely. I should have testimonials about them soon.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:18:07,deedee-ogag,Even though this is not a new concept, the way I am starting to recommend them is new to most people.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:18:24,michael b.-ckak,People are getting away from "take 2 asprin and call me in the morning."

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:19:41,deedee-ogag,I use 
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:20:33,deedee-ogag,Right, Michael - though there is a way to take aspirin in the colon for pain also. 
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:20:57,Dave-ueae,Do the suppositrie melt fast for absorption, and should an enema precede it?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:21:41,deedee-ogag,Aspirin is willow tree bark.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:22:11,randyu-ogag,Suppositories don't clean, just relieve. Enemas do both and work faster and better, right?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:23:10,deedee-ogag,Dave, yes, they do melt quickly, they are very easy to insert, and you should do them in evening when you can lie down until you know how your body will react to them (we don't want embarrassing oil leaking). You should be cleaned out first if possible.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:24:00,deedee-ogag,Enemas do work much better than the normal suppository. I am using suppositories for healing purposes, not eliminating purposes.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:25:28,Dave-ueae,Can't ever recall getting a suppository, just a soap stick once as a child that was followed by an enema anyway. 
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:25:37,randyu-ogag,How much water is the norm for adults?  One quart at a time?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:25:43,deedee-ogag,These suppositories deliver healing oils/herbs into the body so we can directly heal hemorrhoids,  fissures, IBS, prostate issues, etc.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:26:21,Dave-ueae,Do you manufacture the suppository at OHN?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:27:35,deedee-ogag,Randy, many people work up to 3 - 4 quart enemas for a high enema and thorough cleanse.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:28:38,randyu-ogag,For a lower bowel cleanse only, about a quart for that?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:28:55,deedee-ogag,Dave, I make the oil/herb combinations here and put them in a bottle, and give instructions on how people can make the suppositories at home - they are very easy.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:29:09,deedee-ogag,Unfortunately it would be hard to ship the coconut oil as a suppository because it would melt above 76 degrees.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:29:33,deedee-ogag,I make them up here though for clients wanting to have one after their

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:30:16,Dave-ueae,Sounds good.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:30:23,deedee-ogag,I use a rounded (smaller) ice cube tray and about 1 tablespoon of melted coconut oil per suppository  -  add your oils/herbs to this and cool until firm.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:30:56,deedee-ogag,Randy, 1 - 2 quarts for a lower bowel cleanse is fine.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:31:23,deedee-ogag,Randy, we also recommend a series of enemas here (3) that gets the colon very cleaned out.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:31:46,Dave-ueae,I think vintage enema cans and bags were 2 quarts/liters. Bags seem smaller now.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:32:48,deedee-ogag,Our smallest enema bag/bucket

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:33:36,randyu-ogag,What if in my case I have not been cleansed in a couple of years?  For

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:34:52,deedee-ogag,The two quart enema will be a temporary fix, but to really get cleaned out, we recommend the

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:36:29,deedee-ogag,You don't have to do enemas consecutive days, but do several or have someone perform a colonic to get you started if you can find that in your area.  If not, no worries, it can be done at home.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:37:21,deedee-ogag,It is a cold day here in Wisconsin.  How is it by you all?

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:37:44,randyu-ogag,Cold, snowy here... icy... winter.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:38:27,randyu-ogag,I do take benefiber or fiber tabs and stool softener now and then, fiber daily.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:39:32,randyu-ogag,Yes, common but embarassing to talk about with someone, even doctor or nurse.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:40:02,deedee-ogag,Dave, yes, colonics are becoming more popular, but we are trying to bring back the enema for in home, because of the economy, etc.,  people may not be able to have as many colonics as they should.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:40:32,randyu-ogag,My memory tells me that the cleansing enema way back now and then made me feel better and more alive... open.

We eat and can't go, etc., then it all comes out at once, then starts over.  Have to break the cycle.... DeeDee, thanks for the kind works...

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:46:17,deedee-ogag,Randy, I can talk briefly with you about general things unless we set up a specific appointment (consult) which is $ 1.40 per minute. I cannot make specific recommendations unless we do that and I have a health intake form from you.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:51:36,deedee-ogag,Madison is great!   The office number is 608-242-0200  or you can e-mail me at  deedee@[ourdomain].com.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:52:25,deedee-ogag,Yes, medication is hard on the liver and colon.  Cleansing is very beneficial for that.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:53:02,Dave-ueae,With mild flu: a colonic or just an enema or two?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:53:33,deedee-ogag,Dave, either is good.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:54:49,deedee-ogag,I am looking forward to preparing some antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial suppositories for next year's flu season!
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:54:53,Dave-ueae,My childhood enemas usually were connected with a bug. Standard advice then. Not alone I'm sure.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:55:15,randyu-ogag,No, not at all...
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:55:33,Dave-ueae,Randy, your mom gave them?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:55:49,randyu-ogag,Yes, how did you know that?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:56:28,michael b.-ckak,I have been without flu for awhile. I keep following the diet changes and colon cleansing Kristina suggested starting 5 years ago. Must be doing right.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:56:42,deedee-ogag,Yes, enemas/colonics flush the "bad stuff" out more quickly and make the liver and other organs more able to deal with detoxifying the body.  It also boosts the immune system.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:57:18,Dave-ueae,Randy, when you said "not at all"...

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:58:01,Dave-ueae,... a  love/hate thing at the time?
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:58:19,randyu-ogag,Yes.

Some households never practiced them for some reason though.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:58:52,Dave-ueae,It was bittersweet for many.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:59:39,deedee-ogag,Kids of course do not like to be given them, so many people have that bad memory.  Then they start again as adults and really find the benefits.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:59:47,Dave-ueae,Yes, , it was common but not 100 percent in families.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,13:59:48,randyu-ogag,Yes, they were used to cool high fever, too, worked well, and to help relieve constipation.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,14:00:47,deedee-ogag,Yes, the many benefits of a good cleanse  -  and now we can explore even more benefits with them by looking into how we can use implanting for healing  - all very exciting to me!
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,14:00:49,randyu-ogag,Hospitals still use them.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,14:01:22,deedee-ogag,Yes, sometimes they do, but they are mostly unpleasant at the hospital.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,14:01:37,randyu-ogag,Yes and I don't know why.

5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,14:02:42,deedee-ogag,They give them too quickly and many times with chemicals/additives that create cramping.
5c38a7283c9009a76ca6c5d31284e71b4fd44d96,Enema Series and Colon Implant Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-23,14:03:21,randyu-ogag,Maybe I should take a vacation in Madison?

I've tried several cleaners which have helped, but the mildew remains, especially on the shower curtain.

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423,Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-9,20:25:58,kristina-iiai,I will go change that right now!

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423,Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-9,20:30:31,Brett-rfaf,What oils do you recommend as additions to an enema?

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423,Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-9,20:31:57,kristina-iiai,The question that we should instead ask is: how is it that the control on this self-recognition is lost?
03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423,Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-9,20:32:23,kristina-iiai,And how is it that this loss of control then results in tissue destruction?
03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423,Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-9,20:32:54,kristina-iiai,Absolutely there are ways to help your brother and niece with their asthma, without medication.

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423,Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-9,20:34:39,kristina-iiai,JuvaFlex is the one I would start with.

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423,Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-9,20:36:40,kristina-iiai,JuvaFlex is fennel, geranium, rosemary, roman chamomile, blue tansy, and helichrysum.

As far as I am concerned, it is a perfect blend for use in the colon.

03d3b308ab400ef548acb4f720cf7f87f602c423,Autoimmunity Disease Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-3-9,20:47:20,Brett-rfaf,Have you thought about doing research on this?

The suppositories work well before sleep.  You just put them in and lie down and the absorb into the area directly.

3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a,Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-2-23,13:31:39,Doug M-ogag,Hi DeeDee.
3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a,Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-2-23,13:31:43,deedee-ogag,For prostatitis you could use an implant or suppository of peppermint, chamomile, wintergreen, rosemary, myrtle, thyme, tsuga, blue cypress, 
3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a,Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-2-23,13:32:22,deedee-ogag,The herbs we would use for this would be echinacea, saw palmetto, licorice, buchu, and corn silk.

3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a,Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-2-23,13:35:34,deedee-ogag,Dennis, the colon tube usually curls because the passageway is not open enough for it to keep traveling.  Do you use water flowing in when you are inserting?  Also, try different positions to try to open the passageway better.
3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a,Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-2-23,13:36:19,deedee-ogag,Doug, what have you tried in your water?

3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a,Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-2-23,13:47:07,michael b-fjaj,I worry about diabetes myself. The fact that you, Doug, are aware of this gives you a head start.
3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a,Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-2-23,13:48:45,deedee-ogag,We do have a product that is called prostatrol forte and is saw palmetto, zinc selenium, nettles root, and pygeum bark.  It is in pill form, so you take it orally.
3896aaf081a46e105ab3921e4511d094f4fd338a,Colon Implants Suppositories Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-2-23,13:49:30,deedee-ogag, is such an epidemic right now and can be prevented, so that is very encouraging.

I can make up the dram bottle of oil and you would make the suppositories at home using coconut oil. You liquify it first, pour it into a little container,

When you are ready, you pop it out and form it with your hands like clay into the shape of a suppository and then insert it.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:03:51,dennis r-iiai,Please tell people you can't lose weight by taking an enema!

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:04:35,Philip W-iiai,We emailed about the temperature of the elimination water.  Has it been shown that different temperatures encourage different rates of elimination?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:05:34,deedee-ogag, because weight is a symptom of toxicity and so when we detoxify with a colon cleanse,
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:05:36,deedee-ogag, we are allowing the body to have the ability to get rid of toxins and therefore weight that is stored in our fat cells.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:06:59,michael b-fjaj,I am sorry to say I have not done much with the trace minerals yet, but will soon. Where is Kristina? I hope she is well.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:10:32,clairew-lhah,A day or two after I do an enema series, I experience gas.  Anything I can do for it?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:10:34,dennis r-iiai,By using my back brace during my enema, I can take in more water and even hold it in longer.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:11:48,deedee-ogag,Phillip, to get to your question, cooler water can either make the colon cramp and sometimes causes the body to hold, but can also cause the body to purge more quickly, so it can be quite individual.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:12:07,donnaj-ogag,Is there any reason not to do enemas daily? 
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:12:24,Dave-ueae,Regardless of ingredients, the therapist thought  moms were wise to give enemas. She first got them from a visiting nurse when pregnant.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:13:18,deedee-ogag,Hi Claire. You can try adding

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:16:33,deedee-ogag,Our wonderful helper Linda has also put together some bath/detoxifying salts which include epsom salts, dead sea salts, coconut oil, and baking soda.  I can then personalize your oil to go with it.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:17:02,Dave-ueae,On personalized, would a lemongrass colonic followed by a coffee enema be OK and not cancel each other out?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:17:22,deedee-ogag,Goldenseal is wonderful!  and everything is absorbed so much more quickly and  efficiently in the colon than by mouth.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:18:02,Joseph-ogag,Yes, it usually kicks out my cold very quickly.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:18:07,deedee-ogag,Yes, I have done lemongrass during the cleansing part of the enema followed by a coffee implant and it works wonderfully.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:19:59,dennis r-iiai,DeeDee, you're doing a great job in our chat. I'm sure everyone feels the same way. Keep it up!

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:21:36,Joseph-ogag,Oh yes, great chat!

I think the addiction comes into play like anything else, when you are using them for other purposes that may not be the healthiest and excessively without the physical need.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:22:02,deedee-ogag,Thank you so much for the kind words of encouragement.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:24:43,Dave-ueae,Thanks. My enemas from early times were always needed, and same today. My newest therapist was given them weekly as a child for

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:26:39,deedee-ogag,Donna, how often are you doing enemas right now?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:26:53,deedee-ogag,Welcome, Jack.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:28:01,donnaj-ogag,I'm averaging 3 times per week.  I'm not feeling like I'm clearing my entire colon.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:29:29,Dave-ueae,Same therapist, who is 60+ and from Europe, said she had her first colonic when 17  years old and 5 months pregnant. No ill effects, but has OHN covered the topic of enemas and colonics and pregnancy in case others would be interested?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:30:32,michael b-fjaj,I think the different oils offered by Young Living are amazing ,and their concept of diffusing the same oils into the air we breath is most interesting.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:31:01,deedee-ogag,Donna, maybe we can make the cleaning out more efficient for you so that you feel like you are getting everything.  It makes a difference of how much water you are using, what is in the water, the equipment you are using, etc.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:31:08,dennis r-iiai,Dr. Oz on TV supports enemas. He talked about that not long ago.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:32:26,deedee-ogag,I love 
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:33:08,deedee-ogag, I am almost done with my 18-month herbal class this month, and herbs and oils are so effective that we should be using them so much more regularly than we are and avoiding medications with a ton of side effects.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:33:37,Jack A.-lhah,DeeDee, is there a particular combination of soap, water, peppermint, etc., that would  help a person eliminate a 2/3 quart enema rather than retaining it, or most of it, for hours?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:33:44,deedee-ogag,Yes, I have heard that Dr. Oz is an enema promoter.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:33:59,donnaj-ogag,I have the 4-qt silicone bag.  Do the essential oils gunk up the tubing at all?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:34:48,deedee-ogag,Jack, I would try the soap, peppermint, and salt separately at first so you can tell if there is one thing that is making you hold.  How much salt are you currently using per quart?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:35:40,deedee-ogag,Essential oils do need to be rinsed well with hot soapy water afterwards to eliminate the residue, but they are such pure oils that we don't have much problems with them.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:35:47,deedee-ogag,Hi, Scott.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:36:12,Jack A.-lhah,One teaspoon per quart, plus one extra just because.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:36:32,Scott-rfaf,Hi DeeDee and all. Sorry I'm late.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:37:32,deedee-ogag,Hi, DanH.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:38:26,deedee-ogag, and

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:39:16,Jack A.-lhah,What about water temperature?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:39:19,donnaj-ogag,Ok, thanks.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:41:18,Dave-ueae,DeeDee, we're just all backed up - with questions :D 
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:41:26,deedee-ogag,Dave, since you have done enemas awhile, do you have any tips on the temp. and on eliminating water that doesn't want to leave?  Massaging the abdomen is very important also.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:41:42,DanH-ueae,Joining late, but upon 2 or 3 cleansing enemas, has there been any discussion regarding implants afterward?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:43:28,dennis r-iiai,After inserting a quart, I clamp off the water for 5 mins. to give my body the chance to warm it up, because water cools down quickly in the bag. It helps me.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:43:58,Scott-rfaf,I've found that retention is more likely with very warm solutions. Massage and positional changes help move things for me.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:43:59,deedee-ogag,Dan, we have been talking a little bit about how effective the colon is at absorbing, so that minerals, herbs, essential oils, etc. can work wonders.  Do you have a particular thing you want to implant?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:44:39,Dave-ueae, I've not had a big retention problem. I do find I do a lot of absorption when dehydrated, but I guess that is to be expected? Soap suds help prevent retention.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:46:06,deedee-ogag,Yes, soap can be very helpful because it is purging - especially peppermint.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:46:29,Scott-rfaf,I agree that soap suds preclude retention.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:47:26,dennis r-iiai,Interesting session today. Thanks DeeDee! Talk again soon, bye!

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:48:49,deedee-ogag,Thank you - any other question that people want to get in?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:49:10,DanH-ueae,DeeDee, my wife and I retain coffee implants for up to 45-60 minutes.  It works well after 2-3 cleansing sessions.  We've done a recipe of olive, coconut, flaxseed oils, MSM, bifidonate, aloe vera juice, and pure water.  Any other recipes?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:49:37,deedee-ogag,Michael, hah!  I will tell her that.  I know her wrists bother her when she is doing too much typing.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:50:10,Dave-ueae,I'm not alone in being raised with Ivory. I think the purpose was to irritate the colon and promote elimination, right? Temp 100F more or less seems best.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:50:24,deedee-ogag,Hi Dan, you guys do quite the implant and I am impressed with the holding time.  How much fluid are you using?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:51:48,deedee-ogag,There are so many different implants and I am currently exploring more and more with herbal and essential oil combinations.  What are you looking for specifically in your implant?  Healing from something specific?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:51:50,poppajoejr-ckak,Very interesting. Signing off. Thanks.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:52:06,deedee-ogag,Thank you.

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:53:34,deedee-ogag,Hello buzzard - any quick questions from you?
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:53:42,Scott-rfaf,Green Palmolive was very common as I was growing up. Very difficult to retain and way too harsh. Bronner's peppermint and regular castille soap packs are my preference these days.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:54:03,michael b-fjaj,I can't help think your typing speed is picking up. Anyway, tell Kristina she is missed.  
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:54:25,deedee-ogag,Soap can be extra irritating for those who have irritation already.  In that case I would use something more soothing, like sea salt and lavender, chamomile, etc.
f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:54:54,Joseph-ogag,Thank you very much DeeDee. Be well and hope to catch you next time!

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:56:11,Dave-ueae,You were given Palmolive?

f5d4bd39cdf8bad26697ac2dac6f901c27014c0c,Enema Solutions and Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2011-1-26,13:58:43,deedee-ogag,Yes, soothing is better and makes for a more positive outlook on colon cleansing!

b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:05:35,Dave-ueae,Getting back to a subject of your last chat: Is the external use of essential oils sufficient to relieve abdominal issues, or first aid pending implant?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:06:00,ddelkamp-iiai,I was just reading a study that they have done on oregano oil.  We know it has antimicrobial properties, so they were putting it onto meat before grilling so that the meat would not have to be cooked as long, saving some of the nutrients and enzymes.  
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:07:22,michael b-fjaj,I have not had a chance to do anything with the minerals yet.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:07:38,ddelkamp-iiai,What they discovered is that it was also inhibiting carcinogenic properties, so it can actually prevent cancer - is what they are thinking.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:07:48,ddelkamp-iiai,Oregano oil is one of the essential oils we have been using here. Just thought that was interesting and potentially really great!!
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:08:50,ddelkamp-iiai,.  It depends on the oil and its properties as to how it will work best.  Also, everyone responds differently.  What oils are you wanting to work with?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:09:57,Dave-ueae,Perhaps lavender and other soothing ones.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:10:12,ddelkamp-iiai,Did you have questions about the minerals, Michael?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:11:27,ddelkamp-iiai, can work really well topically and internally, as well as inhaled.  If you are trying to soothe the intestines, rubbing over your whole stomach area and doing an implant of the lavender should both work very well.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:12:18,ddelkamp-iiai,Is anyone planning a New Year's cleanse?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:12:59,Dave-ueae,An aid to regularity (anti-constipation) as well as soothing?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:13:44,Dave-ueae,Have a colonic lined up first of year.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:14:32,michael b-fjaj,I would like for you to talk more about a New Year's cleanse.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:14:51,ddelkamp-iiai,Lavender is more soothing, but not as useful for constipation.  Peppermint, ginger, fennel, tarragon, and a blend of these and more found in 
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:16:03,ddelkamp-iiai,I will be doing the

b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:17:04,ddelkamp-iiai,Dave, do you still do colonics every year around that time?  Or do you do them throughout the year also?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:18:22,Dave-ueae,Monthly or a bit more frequently year-round, including OHN of course, lol.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:19:46,Dave-ueae,Lot of therapists tell me they follow the same schedule.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:20:42,ddelkamp-iiai,I will use lemongrass in my colonics.  I have been using lemongrass on my clients.  This is very good for killing all the bad bacteria and also restoring the good flora as well as working on constipation.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:21:19,ddelkamp-iiai,Yes, I try do a cleanse monthly for maintenance, and if I am doing a fast, etc.,  I do it more frequently.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:21:50,Dave-ueae,A few drops in the water or as implant?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:22:50,ddelkamp-iiai,I use about 6-12 drops in the water as I am doing the cleansing part of the colonic (or enema) and then about 6 drops at the end with a little water and have the client hold for 10 minutes or so.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:23:13,michael b-fjaj,It has been 5 years since I found Kristina's website. My concern at that time was toxins that I had been exposed to.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:25:05,ddelkamp-iiai,Do you feel that you removed most of your toxins at this point, Michael?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:26:25,ddelkamp-iiai,So Michael, what is keeping you from trying your mineral implant?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:27:53,Dave-ueae,Will have to try lemongrass next time. Have several binding drugs at work.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:28:42,ddelkamp-iiai,I will tell you a little more about lemongrass.  Just jump in with any questions about that or anything.  Lemongrass is used for purification and digestion.  It is antifungal, antibacterial, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, regenerates connective tissue, and ligaments, dilates blood vessels, improves circulation, and promotes lymph flow.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:29:41,ddelkamp-iiai,This would be a great oil to use when the flu hits.  Especially the stomach flu.  To rub on and to use in an enema!
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:31:32,Dave-ueae,Stomach flu and enemas seem contradictory on the surface, but some of us learned early they were not.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:32:32,michael b-fjaj,Hi again, DeeDee. I am much more aware of toxins now, and avoid them, but now know more about ridding my body of them, much thanks to OHN.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:33:20,ddelkamp-iiai,That is very true.  Doing an enema during the flu helps the body to rid itself of the virus more quickly and makes the length of the illness much shorter and less severe.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:35:28,ddelkamp-iiai,How are your immune systems holding up?  Are you on vitamin D?  Our 
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:36:18,Dave-ueae,That was the wisdom back in the day when an enema bag or can was a household necessity. Needs to be revived.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:37:51,ddelkamp-iiai,That is very true.  Dave, did you receive 
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:37:51,michael b-fjaj,The company, Young Living, is most amazing, all of oils they offer.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:38:50,ddelkamp-iiai,I love 
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:40:14,Dave-ueae,Probably two or three a year, generally associated with illness combined with constipation. A need, not a scheduled thing. Others tell you similar?
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:41:57,ddelkamp-iiai,Yes, not to offend, but some of the older clients I have do tell me about those experiences and how even though they did not like getting them at the time, they did make them feel better.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:42:14,ddelkamp-iiai,Others in the same age range never experienced them, so it is interesting on how some had them in their house and others didn't.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:43:57,michael b-fjaj,The latest I have read is that flu shots still have mercury, aluminium, and formaldehyde.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:45:39,ddelkamp-iiai,You are probably right about the shots, though they will tell you that they are perfectly safe.  I never get them for myself or my family.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:46:54,Dave-ueae,Very typical bittersweet memories. Most of my neighbor friends had homes with bags displayed in the bathroom. No secrets. But there are others that were non-enema, as you say.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:48:23,ddelkamp-iiai,I wonder if the enema bag users were more of the natural healer types of households.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:50:13,michael b-fjaj,When I was in basic training in the army, I got all the shots that people going to Vietnam got. Talk about some strange reactions. 
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:50:45,ddelkamp-iiai,Do either of you have a specific question for me before we end?  My client has come in and is waiting for her session.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:51:05,Dave-ueae,Maybe today rather than back them, when enemas were not "alternative" medicine but something most docs totally approved of. Even Spock in his early post WWII editions.
b45551d9dfd6c75d164cfc8d22b4b46c9ec61380,Detoxification and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-12-22,13:51:29,Dave-ueae,All for me. Thanks, DeeDee.

dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:09:07,DeeDee-ogag,Brooke, that is probably correct.  Soy acts like an estrogen in the body and can definitely lead to an imbalance of hormones.  We would need to make sure the digestive system and liver were working well first. (The liver helps to remove the excess hormones in the body.)
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:09:23,Moron4392-fjaj,Mame:  In closing just want to state may you and your family have a great and blessed Thanksgiving.

dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:10:21,Tiffany B-fjaj,That makes sense...I haven't eaten soy in years (except small amounts of fermented soy)  but he said he could "feel" that the effects were still in my system

dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:11:55,DeeDee-ogag,Drew, none of our systems comes with the

Also do you think there are any tests that I should do prior to that discussion to give a more clear picture of what is going on?

dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:21:24,Tiffany B-fjaj,I have been doing coffee enemas too... When I do them I can feel my liver and gallbladder cleaning out,  BIG TIME!
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:21:46,DeeDee-ogag, are great, aren't they?  I love them.

dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:22:51,DeeDee-ogag,Right, and helping your liver like that will also help with the excess hormones.
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:23:00,Tiffany B-fjaj,Yep, that's what I figured.
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:23:20,Tiffany B-fjaj,I do have a question: what do you think of food allergy tests (IGg90)?
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:23:40,Tiffany B-fjaj,If they say that you have an immune reaction to milk.....do you think you should still do raw dairy?
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:25:02,DeeDee-ogag,Food allergy testing can be very helpful.  I know of people that were kind of stuck in the recovery and once they did a food allergy test and removed some items that they were eating regularly, they started getting better.
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:25:58,DeeDee-ogag, is much better because our bodies do process it much better, but if it shows up as an allergy, you may want to remove it all together.  That is what Kristina did.
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:26:16,Tiffany B-fjaj,Did she remove it permanently?
dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:26:20,Tiffany B-fjaj,Even raw butter?

dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:26:54,DeeDee-ogag,She also removed eggs.  She already had gluten and soy removed.

Recently, a clerk at a local health food store suggested using chlorophyll on occasion. Is this very common and are there any contraindications?

dc808451bda7bff0f7ac77f97601d751ca4c829c,Enemas and Essential Oils Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-24,13:55:23,DeeDee-ogag,You want to do 1-2 higher volume cleansing enemas first.  Then you implant smaller amounts of the chlorophyll (a couple of ounces) and retain for as long as your body lets you.   You can also take chlorophyll perles  orally before enemas.

Every problem in your body is recognized by your brain. Any weakness or symptom in the body, any in balance with hormones, blood sugar or emotional health, any physical trauma and any sign of accelerating gene is it knowledge to the brain. Essential Oil Body Feedback  uses the connection of the brain and the body along with therapeutic grade essential oils to tell you what your body requires to promote a fabulous colon cleanse and to promote healing.

Then you smell essential oils and after you exhale, regress the tender area on the body to see if it is less tender, the same or worse. The body provides the feedback to let you know which essential oils promote the best healing for your individual needs.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:16:27,kristina-iiai, Charles, what solution were you using or do you use when you try to hold the 2 quarts of water?

8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:17:15,kristina-iiai, Hi John

8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:20:07,hanna750-iiai,Hi there

8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:20:48,kristina-iiai, Here connections are made with several areas of the brain that register problems and health concerns of the body.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:20:58,Howard-ogag,Liquid Soap causes some upset and could result in the situation you said. I use peppermint oil instead.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:21:47,kristina-iiai, When you smell essential oils, they are temporarily affecting areas of the brain that are registering problems in the body. This effect can be measured by checking key areas of tenderness on the body.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:22:10,kristina-iiai, Thank you Howard.

8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:25:09,kristina-iiai,  With my work with the acupuncturist Michelle  Buchanan, I have learned that it is important to test your essential oils that you use in your colon. It seems that it is best to rotate your essential oils similar to rotating foods in your diet.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:26:59,kristina-iiai, Hanna,  can you please tell me more? Do you clear out the colon before you take a coffee enema? How often do you take a coffee enema? How much coffee do you use? How long have you been taking the coffee enemas? When you say I feel bad, what exactly do you mean? How do you feel  badly?
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:28:15,hanna750-iiai,Yes, I do a water enema first and then the coffee and retain it for 15 min.  I've been doing them for 2 yrs now.  I do add a tsp of

8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:33:17,Charles N-fjaj,Kristina, essential oil rather than castile soap?

8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:34:13,kristina-iiai, Yes, Charles. Many people have excellent cleansing results with a better therapeutic action when they use essential oils in the colon  instead of soap.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:34:33,Charles N-fjaj,Thanks.

The coffee enema does make me feel worse but maybe it's detoxing.  I wish it would make me feel better.  I guess my question is: could it be circulating the toxins?
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:36:13,Joseph-ogag,Hi Kris - just wanted to say I bought the 32fr 30 inch colon tube from you and I love it.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:37:09,kristina-iiai, That's a good question, Dave. Magnesium is an essential mineral for colon health.  Yes, it is important for all ages. For dosage, may I recommend a 
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:37:47,kristina-iiai, Hello Joseph!  Thanks for the update. It would be great to hear what we love about it.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:40:27,Joseph-ogag,Well, I like that it is silicone, and I feel safe with that. It was way less intimidating than I imagined once I saw the small package, and I got about 18" in the first time (only used it once so far), and I could take the 2 quarts very easily.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:40:30,kristina-iiai, Magnesium, besides being an essential mineral for regular bowel movements, is present in most cells and plays an essential role as the cofactor, assisting enzymes and catalyzing many necessary chemical reactions. Magnesium functions in reactive processes, such as nerve conduction, muscular movement, bone metabolism, protein synthesis, fat and carbohydrate metabolism, and glucose utilization.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:41:52,kristina-iiai,Thanks, Joseph.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:42:49,Joseph-ogag,You are welcome... so now I know when I take a coffee retention that the fluid will get where it needs to be.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:43:59,Dave-ueae,Magnesium sounds valuable. Good in maintaining regularity?
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:44:09,kristina-iiai, Yes, the coffee enema could be circulating the toxin. I have an article on my website about using  the 
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:45:26,hanna750-iiai,I actually have chlorella at home.  How many hours before the enema should I take it?
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:46:14,kristina-iiai, I would also make sure that it is the coffee enema that's causing the problem. I would do an enema series without using the coffee implant to see if you have the same results. I would also vary the amount of coffee that you use,  vary the water source that you use,  vary the stimulant that you use, etc. With the method, biofeedback method,  that we are soon to have on our website, you can learn how to test all of these factors to determine which choices are best for you on a given day.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:46:31,michael b.-ckak,Young Living is most amazing. They are just nuts about thieves. They offer household cleaners with oil of thieves, foaming hand soap, and more oils than I could imagine. Also diffusers, thinking it is most wonderful to have the scent of oils in your daily life.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:47:30,kristina-iiai, Chlorella binds toxins tightly. Once coffee stimulates your gallbladder to contract and release toxin-laden bile into the small intestine, you want something where the bile duct enters  the intestine to bind the toxins so tightly they will not be read and sort through the intestinal wall.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:48:13,kristina-iiai, What this means is that you take a handful of chlorella tablets, 15 to 30 tablets, timed to precede the start of the enema by about 30 minutes.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:48:41,kristina-iiai, Just before starting the enema,  take an additional handful of chlorella tablets - about 5 to 15 tablets.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:50:02,kristina-iiai, The dosage,  generally,  for magnesium supplementation is between 400  and 1000 mg per day.
8f6c948e676df4dbb974d9395c17fb4f4d8494a2,Essential Oil Colon Cleansing Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-11-10,20:50:13,kristina-iiai, Once a person takes too much magnesium, they will get diarrhea.

It is the ratio of these four minerals that is one of the cornerstones to good health. This is because these are the main minerals used for cellular respiration. These are the main four minerals - potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium - that  assist the body, each and every cell, to take in nutrients and to release waste.

However, if one is going to lie on their side, I recommend that you start out on your left side and once all the solution is in the colon,  move on to your right side, slowly, using your back.

However, if you call DeeDee and tell her to get together with me  to send you a care package, I will make sure that happens within the next week. You let her know I said this.

I have been working closely with a friend of ours who is an acupuncturist and we are beginning to use essential oils (Young Living) in our treatments.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:01:46,michael b-fjaj,this is great, to have you answer the questions before i ask them. it is really windy and rainy here.

Essential oils are the life source of the plant and carry the highest healing frequency of all supplements.  When properly processed, therapeutic grade essential oils are safe to drink, apply to

These oils are highly effective because their nutrients are readily assimilated on a cellular level, bypassing normal digestion.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:06:22,michael b-fjaj,with your info, i became most aware of young living. they seem right on top of everything with oils.

Some oils are well known to be cleansing oils, like citrus oils...lemon, orange, etc., but peppermint can be very stimulating to the colon.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:08:53,Dee Dee-lhah,It kind of depends on what we feel may be causing the constipation and how you as an individual respond to the different oils when tested.

This one may be good if the person is experiencing yeast overgrowth, or a skin fungus, etc.

Is it possible for this to go too far in? and when i do an enema series, do i start high in the colon, or start lower and work higher?
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:14:28,Dee Dee-lhah,Thieves has clove, lemon, cinnamon bark, eucalyptus, and rosemary.  It smells wonderful and also makes a great household cleaner that is non-toxic.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:15:49,Dee Dee-lhah,You can do your first enema lower, to clean out the lower portion of the colon first, then it will be easier to work your way up and get water higher for a more thorough cleanse.  You can go up as far as is comfortable with your colon tube.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:16:30,Dee Dee-lhah,You never want to force the tube, but rather work it in slowly, and add small amounts of water as you go to help and open up the colon for easier insertion.

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:30:36,susanb-ogag,If you are using essential oils,

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:31:25,Charles N-fjaj,is a plug necessary to retain a large enema using a colon tube?
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:32:39,Dee Dee-lhah,Because the colon is such a highly absorbable site in the body, implants can be very effective.  Celtic Sea Salt delivers minerals. Enema coffee promotes cleansing of the gallbladder, liver and blood.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:34:00,Dee Dee-lhah,Aloe juice and olive oil along with MSM promotes healing of joints and the mucosal lining of the colon, and probiotics will help to regulate the intestinal flora. The oils we will be using have endless possibilites for healing, so I think they will be absolutely great for everything.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:35:18,Dee Dee-lhah,When you take in a large enema, you will not be holding that too long, so a plug will probably not be necessary.  You can expel that on the toilet shorly after taking it in.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:35:47,Dee Dee-lhah,Where the plug comes in handy is when you are taking these smaller implants that you need to hold longer.  The plug, for some people, helps you to hold the implant longer.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:37:19,Dee Dee-lhah,I think for implanting the oils, using our

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:38:53,Dee Dee-lhah,The length of time for holding each implant will be different, depending on the result you are trying to achieve.  Coffee is held for 15 minutes, but you would want to hold many of these oil implants for a long time - until they naturally come out with your next bowel movement.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:39:31,Shirley B-fjaj,I use straight white vinegar for grease on the kitchen counters. Would that be suitable for the colon tubes?
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:39:33,Dee Dee-lhah,  Much of that will be absorbed through the colon walls and into the system by then, which is what we want.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:40:30,Dee Dee-lhah,Yes, you could definitely use vinegar on your colon tube.
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:41:43,Dee Dee-lhah,If i missed someone's question, please let me know  - it is hard to keep track sometimes.

I do allow the coffee to "steep" in me for about 15 min., while lying down (couldn't resist the coffee pun). Are the other implants about 1 qt? 1 pint?
d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:42:47,Dee Dee-lhah,Yes, it could very well be.  what type of reaction do you get?

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:43:45,Shirley B-fjaj,Thank you

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:44:33,susanb-ogag,Do you implant the essentials oils mixed with something else? Olive oil?

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:46:31,Dee Dee-lhah,I will be putting drops of essential oil right into the hose of the colonic system after cleansing and following it with a small amount of water.

d509f9d30c45dd52cebd7884c3a79688c721a98a,Essential Oil Enema Implants Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-10-27,13:48:13,Shirley B-fjaj,Thanks

They must know this instinctively.  I have also heard of people getting nauseous after taking wheat grass.

Yes, I've done coffee enemas. Right now, I use my intuition when I think I need a coffee enema. It's turning out to be about 2X a week, but am wondering if I should do it more often with the chelation.

I used to use Shaklee's, but I think they are discontinuing it.  I will try and remember the other brand name I have used which I think is still good.

Is it because people are looking into more natural health practices and are sick of taking medications?  what do you think?

In the circle of the raw food movement, they talk a lot about colon hydrotherapy, and the importance of detox. Some have mentioned coffee enemas too, and the Gerson therapy is widely discussed there too for cancer patients.

He recommended more fiber and eating prunes, but no mention of enemas.

d8a9184592ed0f92c059b2f83826eb4a709a6814,Colon Cleansing and Vitamin D Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-8-11,20:31:09,Ray J-rfaf,I started it for the liver cleanse and just looking to better health.

This inflammation is generally fatal.
d8a9184592ed0f92c059b2f83826eb4a709a6814,Colon Cleansing and Vitamin D Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-8-11,20:31:29,kristina-iiai,This new solution to acute inflammation in the brain is called therapeutic hypothermia: Ice the patientï¿½s body to lower their temperature by about six degrees and induce a coma for up to 24 hours. This process limits inflammation and can allow people to return to a healthy life after their heart has been inactive for up to twenty minutes.

d8a9184592ed0f92c059b2f83826eb4a709a6814,Colon Cleansing and Vitamin D Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-8-11,20:32:53,kristina-iiai,Many people focus on their outward health and forget that colon health is essential to one's overall well-being. In fact, the Center for Disease Control (CDC)  reported that in 2006, over 139,000 people were diagnosed with colon cancer and over 53,000 people died from colon cancer. Obviously colon health cannot be ignored. Besides pursuing colon health for the prevention of colon cancer, having a healthier colon can promote weight loss, increase energy, reduce fatigue, and even cure headaches. However, the answer is not getting the quick fix with pharmaceuticals. While many prescribed drugs can reduce or even eliminate symptoms of colon problems, they do not address a fundamental lack of colon health.

It was found that those who experience sufficient social interactions were 50 per cent more likely to be alive when re-examined eight years later than those who were more socially isolated

Could wide use of enemas and other colon care back then have helped keep cancer down?

Our food has changed in leaps and bounds in a relatively short time, while our digestive system, particularly our colon, has not been able to keep up. For thousands of years we survived on basic foods such as fruit, game meat, nuts, and wild vegetables. However, in the last hundred years particularly, food has changed drastically: grain-fed meats, potato chips fried in trans fats, and dairy produced with hormones now line the shelves of many grocery stores. These toxins and unnatural foods can clog the colon and may increase the risk of colon cancer.

I absolutely love the beds and my vitamin D levels have been steadily rising since I started to use them, where they hadn't been rising well with the use of vitamin D supplementation.

0f0a3fc8efa5390d37a0fb6eebcd73d6237f6ad5,Vitamin D Therapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-7-28,13:34:28,kristina-iiai,the best way to make sure you don't end up with too much or too little vitamin D is to produce it in your own body, by getting some exposure to beneficial ultraviolet A and B rays, like those produced by the sun.
0f0a3fc8efa5390d37a0fb6eebcd73d6237f6ad5,Vitamin D Therapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-7-28,13:34:39,philiph-lhah,I just checked the site under tanning and it seems like a reasonable price.

Your vitamin D levels can drop as much as 50% in the winter. Depleted of vitamin D, your immune system may not be up to its full potential, leaving you more susceptible to certain health concerns. In fact, I strongly believe that vitamin D deficiency is a growing epidemic!

For example, memory ductile cells in the breast need vitamin D to access DNA that enables the response to estrogen. So naturally, without sufficient amounts of vitamin D, your cells cannot access their DNA libraries and their functions are thereby impaired.   This is why vitamin D functions in so many different tissues, and affects such a large number of different diseases and health conditions. So far, scientists have found about 3,000 genes that are upregulated by vitamin D. Receptors that respond to the vitamin have been found in almost every type of human cell, from your brain to your bones. And researchers keep finding health benefits from vitamin D in virtually every area they look.

But perhaps most important to note is that vitamin D can lower your risk of dying from any cause, according to a new

We examined the risk of dying from any cause in subjects who participated in randomized trials testing the impact of vitamin D supplementation (ergocalciferol [vitamin D2] or cholecalciferol [vitamin D3]) on any health condition.
0f0a3fc8efa5390d37a0fb6eebcd73d6237f6ad5,Vitamin D Therapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-7-28,13:48:07,kristina-iiai,Conclusions:  Intake of ordinary doses of vitamin D supplements seems to be associated with decreases in total mortality rates. The relationship between baseline vitamin D status, dose of vitamin D supplements, and total mortality rates remains to be investigated. Population-based, placebo-controlled randomized trials with total mortality as the main end point should be organized for confirming these findings.

Vitamin D from sunlight acts as a pro-hormone, rapidly converting into 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or vitamin D3.

If the response is mostly that one feels better, then as much as daily. If the response of the body is to feel worse, than I wouldn't recommend the coffee enema more than one time a month, unless constipation is an issue.

Betaine has been shown to be an effective lipotrophic agent. Lipotrophic agents promote the transportation and use of fats, helping to prevent the accumulation of fat in the liver. Vitamin A has an important and specific effect on lipid metabolism. Bovine liver and orchic extract are important in the metabolism of blood fats.

Is there anything I can do about this?
8a88900718ef6383b1a880ff6455805a79ebd414,Candida and Stool Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-7-14,20:28:23,kristina-iiai,Additionally, I don't know what you have already tried to rid  yourself of the Candida.

This will enable your adrenal glands to relax. It is the adrenal glands that raise the blood sugar between meals when we go more than 2ï¿½ hours without eating. Some people feel hungry, tired, unfocused, or perhaps hyper throughout the day as their adrenal glands compensate for the drop in blood sugar. Instead of having the stress hormones cortisol and adrenalin do the work to keep the blood sugar at a normal level, it is better to eat and let your adrenals take a vacation.

Try using only the sea salt and no peppermint. Try taking just a water enema or just a coffee enema. Experiment with all the elements to see if one of them is bothering you.

Some believe that Lyme Disease is the underlying causative agent of many chronic health conditions, including but not limited to: allergies, heart arrhythmias, arthritis (both osteo and rheumatoid), ADD, auto-immune disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, macular degeneration, sensory or motor radiculoneuropathies (i.e., clumsiness in the hands or feet and/or burning, tingling or numbness), Alzheimer's Disease, ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), Bell's palsy, irritable bowel syndrome and gastrointestinal distress, lupus, polymyalgia rheumatica (a more severe form of fibromyalgia), sleep disorders, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, brain fog, memory loss, joint pain/swelling/stiffness, lack of coordination, unexplained chills and fevers, recurrent infections, poor concentration, tremors, shortness of breath, anxiety or panic attacks, heart palpitations, weight changes (loss or gain), sore throats, loss of appetite, muscle pain or cramps, obsessive compulsive disorders, headaches/migraines, light sensitivity, trigeminal neuralgia, unexplained hair loss, and visual changes.

03de70cb2ada0fe54647f26c5f8d505a92330b70,Lyme Disease and Immunity Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-6-9,20:10:31,Dave-ueae,Re tick, i volunteer at a park, but largely inside, so a visitor must have been a carrier. Swelling in upper leg and the critter visible. Dermatologist extracted it. Want some of our spare deer? We have many. many!
03de70cb2ada0fe54647f26c5f8d505a92330b70,Lyme Disease and Immunity Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-6-9,20:10:37,kristina-iiai,a recent study demonstrated the efficacy of Cat's Claw (Unicaria tomentosa) in destroying the Lyme organism. In fact, in the study, the control group of 14 patients all took antibiotics and only 3 improved slightly, 3 got worse and the remainder had no change in their clinical condition. The experimental group was treated with Cat's Claw and 85% of them were negative for the Lyme organism after 6 months and all the patients experienced a dramatic improvement in their clinical condition. (Cowden, WE, MD, et al., "Lyme Disease: Nutraceutical Breakthrough Using TOA-Free Cat's Claw", Focus, Feb '04, pp.3,4) In utilizing Cat's Claw, it is extremely important that the quality and purity of the product be assured. This herb occurs naturally in 2 forms: the more common TOA form and the rarer POA form. For those of you with a chemical bent, TOA stands for tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid and POA for pentacyclic oxindole alkaloid. Only the POA form is effective in stimulating the immunity which destroys the organism. As little as 1% TOA can cause a 30% reduction in the immune system modulating properties that POAs provide. Unfortunately some commercially available products contain as much as 80% TOAs. (Ibid, p. 3) The Medi-Herb Cat's Claw that we use at the RFHC is 1.5% to 2.0% POAs, the highest concentration available, and is TOA free. Therefore, the amount needed is less, making it much more affordable than other POA products on the market. We did a cost study and determined that using Medi-Herb Cat's Claw was very cost effective. ($60 for a month's supply vs. $325 for a month's supply from the other retailer.)

For optimum health, your body relies on a properly functioning immune system. Two naturally-ocurring plant compounds, sterols and sterolins, have been found to provide significant immune-regulating benefits. Even though they are widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, few people consume sufficient quantities of these foods to achieve maximum benifits. Exciting new clinical research published by leading immunologist, Prof. P. Bouic, Ph.D, demonstrates that supplementation with the patented combination of sterols and sterolins found in Moducare Sterinol can play an important role in optimizing your body's immune function.

They occur naturally in plants, animals, and fungi, with the most familiar type of animal sterol being cholesterol. (one reason people's bodies tend to raise the cholesterol levels.)

Important zoosterols are cholesterol and some steroid hormones; notable phytosterols include campesterol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol. Ergosterol is a sterol present in the cell membrane of fungi, where it serves a role similar to cholesterol in animal cells.

I do agree sterols and sterolins are highly therapeutic.

May include long-term antibiotic therapy b. May include traditional Chinese medicine c. May include long-term Western herbal therapy (Cat's Claw, Wormwood, Echinacea Premium and Sarsaparilla) d. Homeopathy e. Orthomolecular nutrition f. Heat treatment to increase cellular activity (diathermy, spa, sauna) g. May include electromagnetic therapies, such as Rife machines 2. Open the pathways of elimination to deal with aggravation of the die-off of organisms, or Herxheimer reaction a. Lymph massage b. Exercise to increase lymph movement c. Skin brushing d. Chi gong, yoga, etc e. High protein, high fat, low carb diet with vegetables (modified elimination diet). Avoid artificial sweeteners. Drink lots of pure water. Quality essential fatty acids are critical. f. Maintain alkalinity via supplements or bicarbonate. Supplements include buffered Vitamin C to bowel tolerance, green drink, Chlorophyll Perles (Standard Process). See Alkaline Broth recipe, attached. 3. Drain the lymph, liver and gall bladder and clear the colon to clear the body of TNF alpha and neurotoxins, along with heavy metals a. Probiotics to maintain normal bowel flora b. Gall bladder flushes (use hot lemon tea to maintain gall bladder function) c. Daily doses of colon cleanse (psyllium with betonite clay) d. Coffee enemas (I personally do not recommend) 4. Circulate the blood and make it less viscous a. Enzyme therapy to reduce rouleau formation b. Trace Minerals concentrate with a couple grains of high quality cayenne to enhance circulation to extremities. The warming herb helps balance the cold effect of Cat's Claw. c. Ginko biloba to open capillary beds 5. Regulate the immune system to target the organisms and lower the inflammatory responses, keep the body alkaline a. Chlorophyll extract from green leafy vegetables b. A green drink or Alkaline Broth 6. Maintain body temperature at 98.6ï¿½F a. Support thyroid function, as needed (Thyroid Complex/Medi-Herb) 7.

d5a1e035efeb2784be201bf4450d1939f8f510ea,Constipation and Coffee Enemas Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-5-26,13:43:53,kristina-iiai,Normally, the rectum is securely attached to the pelvis with the help of ligaments and muscles. This attachment firmly holds the rectum in place. Various factors, such as age, long-term constipation, and the stress of childbirth, may cause these ligaments and muscles to weaken, which means that the rectum's attachment to the body also weakens. This causes the rectum to prolapse, meaning it slips or falls out of place. Occasionally, large hemorrhoids  (large, swollen veins inside the rectum) may predispose the rectum to prolapse.

c33a96c32f31eccbc82f571a193e53e15d72235c,Core Restore Colon Cleanse Kit Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-28,20:46:19,kristina-iiai,Dave, there are excellent, supportive herbs in the product: licorice root, ginger, oregon grape root and red clover flowers. However, there are herbs in this formula that act on the colon in such a way to reduce its functioning: buckthorn bark and turkey rhubarb.
c33a96c32f31eccbc82f571a193e53e15d72235c,Core Restore Colon Cleanse Kit Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-28,20:47:26,IowaAlan-iiai,OK, I know that getting a colon up as far as possible is the best. Mine came from Kristina's website. It is a larger scale 48-in. I can get about 3 feet in. Is there any special feeling that lets one know that it is up as far as it can go?
c33a96c32f31eccbc82f571a193e53e15d72235c,Core Restore Colon Cleanse Kit Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-28,20:47:56,Dave-ueae,For several months, but not on a daily schedule, but as needed, and also to get system restarted after a colonic. I'll do an enema as last resort but maybe it should get higher priority.
c33a96c32f31eccbc82f571a193e53e15d72235c,Core Restore Colon Cleanse Kit Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-28,20:48:12,kristina-iiai,Often, with prescription medication, the colon backs up because of the load on the liver. I would start with a week of the Core Restore and then switch over to a daily supplement that supports liver and digestive health which would include ingredients such as ox bile, pancreatin, dehydrocholic acid, and black radish.

I've been on the WAPF diet for almost 4 months, trying as hard as I can to eat like your book and am doing a great job really. Rarely I'll eat a candy bar because i do miss a little something sweet. seems like that's when constipation returns
72eaeab05ab12a0e28de3b23fc785033dc5cd028,Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-14,20:17:16,kristina-iiai,I think you will feel so much better as you incorporate these healthy lifestyle changes into your day-to-day life.

72eaeab05ab12a0e28de3b23fc785033dc5cd028,Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-14,20:18:38,Bee L-rfaf,Good question.  has been my nemesis for 25 years and improved greatly on WAPF diet, but started up again.

72eaeab05ab12a0e28de3b23fc785033dc5cd028,Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-14,20:19:09,Bee L-rfaf,what's that? A supplement?

Do others have this issue? I like to use it to loosen things, but my system seems to fight it.
72eaeab05ab12a0e28de3b23fc785033dc5cd028,Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-14,20:19:21,Tara-ueae,ok, thanks!

72eaeab05ab12a0e28de3b23fc785033dc5cd028,Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-14,20:30:20,TomE-ueae,I've tried from fairly quick time with soap dissolving to stronger and at least when used on first series tends to cause me issues.  i will see if doing it second will work.
72eaeab05ab12a0e28de3b23fc785033dc5cd028,Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-14,20:32:01,TomE-ueae,would your liquid soap be milder?

72eaeab05ab12a0e28de3b23fc785033dc5cd028,Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-4-14,20:38:55,michael b-fjaj,not yet

I also recommend the warmest water so a refill is often needed to keep the water temperature high enough with the second enema in the enema series.

Except CT scan showed a fatty liver. I do have very high cholesterol.  I take enemas, what would you suggest in the enema?

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:12:34,tri-squire-ckak,Ok, I guess I will be ordering soon.

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:17:36,Dave-ueae,I'd add that the coffee enema works best when the colon's already cleansed rather than as a single.

This is why you take multiple enemas at one time, over a 30-60 minute period.

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:36:41,Jan H-rfaf,Kristina, is peppermint oil something that I should be using on a regular basis like the goat's milk soap enemas? Also, how much peppermint oil to a 2 quart bag of water?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:37:02,kristina-iiai,I don't know what is going on with the chat connection.

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:37:49,kristina-iiai,Welcome, Jackie
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:38:01,Jackie P-iiai,I have a question, Kristina.  With regards to scheduling, would it be preferable to do enemas before or after exercise?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:38:09,TomE-ueae,is the new 5-ft colon tube the same as the 30-in I bought from you?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:39:11,TomE-ueae,I bought the delrin tip tube but find it a bit too much and use the standard one fine
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:39:38,kristina-iiai,I think try both and see what your body prefers. I see advantages to both taking an enema series before exercise and taking an enema series after exercise.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:39:39,Dave-ueae,Back to coffee enemas: is 6 inches or so of insertion best, rather than deeper?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:40:57,kristina-iiai,yes
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:41:29,Dave-ueae,Thanks, that was my impression.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:42:01,kristina-iiai,Most experts do say to deliver the coffee enema solution past the rectal area but not beyond the sigmoid colon.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:42:39,kristina-iiai,yes, to the new colon tube is the same FR diameter as the 30-inch colon tube, just longer.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:43:12,emmettb-lhah,Kris, I work in home health. About 3 weeks ago picked up scabies in a home i was in. I've been using an online brand to stop this. It's not working. Any advice?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:43:58,kristina-iiai,I don't recommend delivering the entire five feet of colon tube into the colon, but having a longer colon tube can make it easier to insert the colon tube deeper into the colon.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:44:50,TomE-ueae,I can use the 30-in but think only a few more inches would be the limit.  The longer length would be nicer though.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:46:02,Tom P-rfaf,Kristina... have you encountered the idea that frequent colonics, or high enemas, can aid in the treatment of ADD or ADHD for preteens?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:46:58,kristina-iiai,To clear out scabies, use an essential oil like peppermint, lavender or tea tree oil. Other essential oils that are reported to work well to eliminate scabies are anise and ylang-ylang.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:48:17,kristina-iiai,Tom, not as a stand alone treatment, but certainly as a part of a health optimizing program that includes a gut healing diet, such as I write about in 
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:48:59,Tom P-rfaf,Do you know of any articles on the 'net that discuss this?  I have a mom-friend who has an ADD child.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:49:18,kristina-iiai,Yes, peppermint oil can be used in an enema on a regular basis. Use 2-4 drops of peppermint oil per quart of water.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:50:19,Jan H-rfaf,Thank you!

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:51:55,TomE-ueae,I am planning to get something set up with DeeDee on my return and travel into Wisconsin late March/April.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:51:59,kristina-iiai,To start with, it is important to prepare for your spring cleanse in order for it to be supportive of the body and not more harmful. 
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:52:32,kristina-iiai,For instance, if you have a fatty liver, you can damage your liver if you jump into a spring cleanse without proper preparation.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:52:42,kristina-iiai,Excellent, Tom.

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:53:30,Dave-ueae,Also will be in Madison for a series. What about nutrition  with cleanse?
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:54:05,kristina-iiai,A water-only spring cleanse is a LOT of work for the body: as toxins are released, the liver, the gallbladder, and the colon all need to be optimally functioning in order to remove those previously stored toxins from the body.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:54:43,kristina-iiai,If toxins that are stored in the bodily tissues are released but the body cannot eliminate them easily and fully, you can damage organs.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:55:46,kristina-iiai,To prepare for a spring cleanse if you have liver issues, start by taking a tri-weekly enema series that includes a coffee enema.

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:56:57,kristina-iiai,Make sure your Vitamin D levels are optimized; have a Vitamin D test; use a Vitamin D supplement or a Vitamin D tanning bed as we offer at the Optimal Health Network.
2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:57:33,kristina-iiai,Make sure on the days you do not take enemas that you empty your bowels fully. If not, use our GB3, which is also support for the liver and the gallbladder.

2ce8a043f2bba34625e475e8bf838e59c82c039b,Colon Cleanse Enema Solutions Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-3-10,20:58:35,Jackie P-iiai,All dairy?  Or just pasteurized dairy?

Is it helpful to consume a high fiber drink following them, so the bile and residue that is released from the liver isn't reabsorbed? Is that an issue?
44e06358f1e3eaa5d0a4ef2ee5d2a5fc4751a781,Enema Solutions and Vitamin D Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-2-24,13:04:10,kristina-iiai,Yes, it is an issue.

Phytocore was created as part of The Core Restore BT Kit.  Phytocore supports phase I and phase II detoxification by providing phytonutrients to help eliminate toxins and stimulate the liver during a 7-28 day detoxification program. Silymarin may be one of the most well known liver supporting agents in alternative medicine.  Silymarin has a strong history of use for its role in protecting the liver from medications and environmental contaminants.  Silymarin, along with curcumin and radish root increase phase II enzyme activity in the liver while artichoke, yellow dock, and dandelion root act as gentle choleretic agents.

Plus, some consumer investigations had found that Ivory's antimicrobial activity was better than other skin soaps, even those containing antibacterials such as triclosan.[citation needed] A postulate for this effectiveness is the ability of the soap to lyse bacteria efficiently, and to rinse cleanly. The drawback to the soap was its drying effect on the skin, as it had easily dissolved natural oils. Of all the commercial soaps, Ivory has been considered the best by holistic health people, but was criticized for what it did not contain, glycerin. One reason was that glycerin was expensive and would raise the cost of the bars, which had the value of being about the least expensive soap available for people of modest means.

This is because overexposure to UVB rays, which affect the surface layers of skin, quickly causes sunburns. On the other hand, UVA rays are responsible for the golden-brown tan sought after by most salon patrons. As a result, most tanning salons calibrate their tanning beds to emit approximately 95 percent UVA rays. This calibration maximizes the tanning effects of the machine and minimizes the risk of burning. Unfortunately, it also minimizes the amount of vitamin D that can be metabolized relative to the exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays. In other words, you want your tanning bed calibrated to maximize the amount of vitamin D that your body can metabolze relative to the exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays.

I've been around Spanish speaker for most of my life, but found these folks had trouble commuicating with each other because of dialect.  Which flavor have you learned?

ae2115537814c9ea42b54668f9077454defba85b,Made-for-Enema Coffee Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-1-13,20:17:09,Lisa-ueae,I enjoy your

ae2115537814c9ea42b54668f9077454defba85b,Made-for-Enema Coffee Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-1-13,20:17:34,kristina-iiai,Thanks, Lisa.

ae2115537814c9ea42b54668f9077454defba85b,Made-for-Enema Coffee Alternative Health Live Chat,2010-1-13,20:19:23,Lisa-ueae,All the pictures from your trip are breathtaking!

One needs to call us up as we don't offer it on the website due to Standard Process policy of always starting on these supplements only with a consult first.

71260bf59190e19a1629b75157b69d32985868dc,Enema Series and Colonics Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-25,13:54:16,Jo-0cac,just knowing other folks are doing coffee enemas and experiencing healing helps me!

How else could I have found you from California? I went, carefully, over the various products you make available through your website but I have no experience with using enemas.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:01:20,kristina-iiai,I have a sick child home tonight so I might be a bit slow but I will do my best to delightedly keep up. I sure do appreciate folks showing up!

I would also like to do the colonic irrigation type of enemas. When I telephoned your office today, I was too late to reach staff.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:06:10,nanette d-fjaj,My health: I went for an excellent 2-week fresh juice fast in early July. I've never done these type of things entirely on my own. I have gone for colonics. I make freshly squeezed vegetable juices, lighly steam my vegetables.

818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:08:26,kristina-iiai,Have you had a look at any of our

I am keen on doing the kidney, gall-bladder and liver flushes. But now I know coffee enemas are the best course of action. WHAT, which ones, do I buy?
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:09:30,Brett H.-iiai,enemas have certainly helped my skin, that's for sure

Then there were all the different sizes, tubes, containers but, especially, whatever the "pumps" are used for.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:11:30,Dave-ueae,This opens up the whole topic of seasonal and specialized (liver, kidney, etc.) cleansings.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:14:18,kristina-iiai,There are 2 liter complete colon cleanse coffee enema bucket kits that have the same stainless steel enema bucket, the same 6 ft length of silicone hosing, the same simple-to-use white multi-position clamp, but different nozzles.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:14:38,kristina-iiai,Do you have an idea of what type of nozzle you want to use? I recommend an assortment of nozzles.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:15:12,kristina-iiai,Brett, can you tell us more? What skin troubles were you having?

818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:15:24,nanette d-fjaj,I read one of the testimonials where the man said how much easier it was using the hand "pump" -- and looking at the ones on the website, I had no idea how those are used. I think I like the clear plastic bag, maybe the pail.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:15:25,kristina-iiai,Yes, one nozzle is just fine.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:15:54,Brett H.-iiai,Mainly acne.  I've had it for many years.

818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:17:11,nanette d-fjaj,Ah, the nozzles. To pick just one from across the country? Shoes, I know my size, but I would like to know I may have accidentally chosen exactly what I'd like to have.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:17:17,kristina-iiai,The

818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:18:00,kristina-iiai,However, during your first fill, the retention balloon might place too much pressure within the anus, causing cramping that would be better avoided during the first fill.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:18:06,Brett H.-iiai,That's exactly the nozzle that I have and I do massage my belly.  :-)

818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:18:41,Brett H.-iiai,Thought of that, but I've been fine.  I've learned to deal with the brief initial cramping.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:18:44,nanette d-fjaj,Will I be able to speak with someone in your office so that I can make one order and that one should be complete? -- easiest and most comfortable to use and clean.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:19:09,kristina-iiai,yes, let me look at tomorrow's schedule for you

818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:20:14,kristina-iiai,The office is very busy tomorrow. Best times to call our between 9:15 and 9:50 and between 3 and 4. All central time.

818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:20:53,kristina-iiai,How did you figure out the dairy effect?
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:21:01,Brett H.-iiai,Steam sauna once a week.

818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:22:19,Brett H.-iiai,Research online.  Many people in forums I've read cut out or greatly decrease their dairy intake, and saw improvement in their skin.  I think it's the hormones in milk that's the culprit.
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:22:21,kristina-iiai,Does anyone use the seasonal cleanse like Dave brought up? Liver cleanse? Deep tissue cleanse?
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:22:38,kristina-iiai,Have you tried raw dairy?
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:22:41,nanette d-fjaj,The original Finnish sauna is great. One of the body's 4 exits for its release of toxins so I used one for years but no longer have access to one. How do you find it compares with the infrared?
818267bfb59834b30c328195aeb6b0869b629620,Enemas and Colon Hydrotherapy Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-11-11,20:22:42,Brett H.-iiai,I'd like to try a seasonal cleanse.  What's all involved?

Blood shows the bound forms of the hormone. the body also keeps the blood homeostatic, meaning that levels of hormones are maintained and only fluctuate when hormone levels are VERY imbalanced. You will find hormone imbalances in the saliva before you find them in the blood, in other words.

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:17:45 ,kristina-iiai,The Female Hormone Panel (FHP)™ is a simple, non-invasive test. Eleven saliva samples are collected during specified time periods throughout a menstrual cycle.  For the first time in routine medical practice, the FHP will allow both patient and doctor to view the profile of Estrogen and Progesterone (See Figure 1). In addition, we report the cycle average for Testosterone and DHEA. Diagnostic guesswork is minimized, and hormonal balance evaluation and customized treatment become a reality with the FHP.   The expanded FHPï¿½ (eFHPTM) also includes 5 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) measurements to see if both brain control and stimulation of the ovaries is optimal.   Applications of the Female Hormone Panel  The FHP can be used to detect and monitor the following:  ï¿½ Functional infertility ï¿½ Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) ï¿½ Fibroids
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:17:54 ,kristina-iiai,ï¿½ Influence of lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) on the hormone cycle  ï¿½ Menstrual problems originating in the brainï¿½s systems  ï¿½ Early pregnancy problems - spontaneous miscarriage  ï¿½ Cycle irregularities following the use of birth control pills  ï¿½ Dysmenorrhea, i.e. painful and heavy periods ï¿½ Migraine headaches  ï¿½ Endometriosis and cystic ovarian disease ï¿½ Early Osteoporosis  Advantages of the FHPï¿½ 
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:18:04 ,kristina-iiai,1. Convenience: requires no blood draws, therefore no repeated clinic visits, and avoids the inconvenience of the 24-hour urine collection.   2. Customized Hormone Therapy Presently, female hormone therapy is not individualized to the needs of each woman because current diagnostic tests do not provide sufficient data. Consequently, most women are treated without regard to their individualized physiology and specific needs. The FHP, for the first time, will allow a clinician to customize therapy to each woman.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:18:14 ,kristina-iiai,3. As is typical in most clinics, one or two blood samples or a 24-hour analysis of urine for these hormones cannot give an idea of the ovaries' hormonal productivity. The FHP gives a good approximation of the ovariesï¿½ capacity over a whole cycle. 
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:18:40 ,TaraM-rfaf,cool... is there a button on here to email this chat conversation or do I need to copy and paste?

The extended MH panel measures these six hormones plus FSH and LH.   Traditionally, age-related male hormone changes were not considered problematic, because fertility in men persists until an advanced age.  Recent studies and careful evaluation in men has shown progressive changes, including:

The human body is a powerful self-healing system that is designed to be well, to regenerate, and to thrive. Unfortunately, the past model of health care contradicts this truth. Illness and disease are misrepresented as the natural state and as the inevitable result of aging, rather than as the reflection of imbalance and a hindered regenerative process. The result of this disease management system has been catastrophic to the health of our general population. Generations are disconnected from their innate healing potential and believe they must survive in disease.

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:38:32 ,kristina-iiai,we use testing methods to establish the individualized hormonal and metabolic pattern of a patient. One can then identify the most appropriate, effective, and least invasive method for restoring and sustaining endocrine balance. Provided with the proper physical and lifestyle support a person will respond rapidly, and normal endocrine function can return.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:38:34 ,Deb S-rfaf,Okay, if it is natural and I don't want to live like this in my age, what can be done?
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:39:00 ,kristina-iiai,Primary testing methods include saliva testing and hair analysis, in addition to evaluating symptoms and lifestyle patterns. Protocols include lifestyle management, whole food nutritional supplements, high quality herbal supplements, and only when necessary, bioidentical hormone assistance therapy.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:39:13 ,kristina-iiai,No, I don't necessarily think that the enemas caused it.

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:39:44 ,kristina-iiai,What I am wondering is does the prolapse occur after you release the enema solution and waste or just when you move your bowels on  your own?
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:39:55 ,Mike-ueae,Kristina, they have no reason to remove mine...Its just BPH

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:42:39 ,kristina-iiai,Hormones are treated as if they are supplements, which they absolutely are not.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:42:59 ,kristina-iiai,Also, no one hormone is ever the problem or the solution.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:43:11 ,kristina-iiai,Each and every hormone acts within a family of hormones.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:43:14 ,Deb S-rfaf,Unfortunately I have been on them for about 4 years when I thought I was gonna never get out of bed again. I was tested and my levels were none.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:43:40 ,kristina-iiai,It is essential to address the whole family of hormones and then keep monitoring the body 
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:43:51 ,Dave-ueae,Once men reach a certain age (over 70), even if they develop prostate cancer it grows so slowly that something else will be the cause of death. Younger guys are a different story.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:44:11 ,kristina-iiai,If not done properly, bio identical hormones can dysregulate the entire system
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:44:22 ,TaraM-rfaf,Kristina, do herbal breast enhancement creams and pills really work?
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:44:49 ,kristina-iiai,More is not necessarily better in hormoneland. Just the opposite. Excess hormones in the system can and will shut down the endocrine system.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:44:57 ,Deb S-rfaf,I had improved but never had any energy. But I was like that before I was even 25
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:45:32 ,Deb S-rfaf,What can I do now because I do get checked very regularly
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:45:49 ,kristina-iiai,Might you take daily enemas while you work on your gut health with us?
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:46:08 ,Deb S-rfaf,who is that for
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:46:42 ,kristina-iiai,We never use hormone creams because it is impossible to dose them well. The cream gets on family members, pets, and other places it doesn't belong.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:47:56 ,kristina-iiai,In my mind, a 70 year old man is young and needs to also work on the hormonal and toxic issues that caused the cancer in order to optimize his health
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:48:20 ,kristina-iiai,I am glad that you had those tools then. This is good.

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:49:26 ,Dave-ueae,Agreed, best to prevent in the first place.

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:50:23 ,kristina-iiai,Deb, who did you test with? We do use multiple samples

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:52:41 ,harolds-lhah,All of our needs are different, and I am not a doctor, but for me enemas have been a lifetime benefit. My mom was a nurse, and I grew up in the era when most homes had an enema bag hanging on the back of the bathroom door, and enemas help provide good health
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:53:57 ,kristina-iiai, would be an example of one of the products we might use with you once we got to know you better
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:54:42 ,Deb S-rfaf,Is grapefruit extract beneficial for using in the water for an enema?
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:54:56 ,kristina-iiai,Deb, the testing would be similar and if you have current results, within the last 3 months, we can work with the data on the ZRT test but we have chosen to go with the lab Diagnos-Techs
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:55:49 ,Deb S-rfaf,I can call and make an appointment if needed to see what I should do unless the website you just posted is for me
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:56:27 ,kristina-iiai,Hormone creams and gels build up in subcutaneous tissue and after several months or longer, depending on the fat cell content of the person will release excessive amounts of free, unbound hormone into the system.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:56:52 ,kristina-iiai,the use of hormone creams and gels leads to progressive overdosing, triggering a host of increasing problems.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:57:19 ,Deb S-rfaf,Yikes! So hopw would we know this? By a certain test that you just spoke of or what?
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:57:46 ,kristina-iiai,Oral pills will be deactivated or mostly bound by the liver. This can both stress and overwork the liver over time.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:58:38 ,Marcy-rfaf,Thank you so much. You have been very helpful. I will be in touch! Bye for now!

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:59:02 ,michael b-fjaj,Dave, as you well know, us folks can do a lot to maintain better health, kinda why we are at this chat.

55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:59:38 ,kristina-iiai,In other words, each hormone is completely dependent on a team of nutrients in order to function.
55668998d9b4ac17ce8838242f9c05b1938b4e18,Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis Alternative Health Live Chat,2009-10-28,13:59:39 ,Deb S-rfaf,Can I ever have good hormones at my age without medication?
