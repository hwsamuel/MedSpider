The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently aroused global attention due to its rapid spread since its first detection in May 2015 in Brazil to 22 other countries and other territories in the Americas. The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, has also been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly and neurological disorders, and has been declared a Global Emergency by the World Health Organization. This explosive spread of ZIKV in Brazil poses challenges for public health preparedness and surveillance for the Olympics and Paralympics which are due to be held in Rio De Janeiro in August, 2016. We review the epidemiology and clinical features of the current ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, highlight knowledge gaps, and review the public health implications of the current ZIKV outbreak in the Americas. We highlight the urgent need for a coordinated collaborative response for prevention and spread of infectious diseases with epidemic potential at mass gatherings events.

I have my place at the Games so I really, really want them to continue.  Despite the inoculations I must have to go to Brazil, from Hep A to rabies, there isn't one for Zika, or Dengue, so I intend to use the strongest solution of DEET I can find and apply it diligently, sleep under a DDT impregnated net and avoid evenings in the open. And anyway, for an elderly male, Zika is almost not an issue.	But I have children who are presently forming families.   I do NOT want to think I could come back and carry Zika near them so I will have to avoid them for at least two weeks (advice from tropical diseases guru - personal communication, as he said he could not possibly publish that as official!).   And mosquitos of the Aedes species just don't live in the UK, at present anyway - malaria existed in the Thames marshes and Norfolk in the past, and will in the future, as climate change takes place, but not now. http://pmj.bmj.com/content/80/949/663.full So the UK is relatively safe at present, and returning Gamesmakers won't be a problem, here.	But there will be visitors to the Games from throughout that part of the world where Aedes exists.  That's between the isotherms for 10C in winter, and includes almost all of South America, which is already infected, Middle and North America up to California to North Carolina, the whole of Africa, Europe from Southern France to Greece, the Middle East, India, the Far East. most of Australia and the Pacific Islands.  Phew! They ARE going to get Zika!	I really don't know, and I fear that no one knows.  We don't even know if there really is an epidemic of microcephaly in South America, but the human consequences of that if real are horrible.  And we have only six months to find out.

The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. If you have any one of these, you need to go to the urgent care clinic.-

For anyone not a foetus, Zika seems to be a flu-like illness, with no (?) common complications.  So the concern is only for the foetus, What do we know about the association?  This report from CDChttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6503e2.htm finds that in the past Brazil had "approximately 0.5 cases per 10,000 live births" whihc was thought to be an under-report, with a true rate of 1-2/10K.  In only the second half of 2015, 20/10K have been reported, but that no previous head circumference records were made and there had been no laboratory confirmation of Zika infection in the mothers or infants, so that bias is inevitable.  As usual, and as the BMJ bans, more data is needed.But that didn't help me make up my mind - the Games should continue.  Zika WILL spread to the other parts of the world where transmitting mosguitoes live, the Games might let it do so a bit quicker, that's all.John-nsyb1hub1bv8rb1vpeb

Apart from John D many of us have been wondering about this. It is yet another nail in the potential coffin of the Brazil Olympics. There seems increasingly little hope that the infra structure will be in place , some of the watersport areas are likely to be unhealthy , ticket sales I believe are not going well and now Zika. Many of the sports now have other world class competitions and athletes from these may prefer not to compete - particularly if some of the top contenders +/- their countries are absent following drug scandals.	There is also the problem that Brazil is running into problems in its anti-mosquito campaign.	It could be that events will snowball and cancellation become inevitable but that might be pretty disastrous for Brazil and it would require a kirked to decide how far compensation would be payable.	Any advice on returning travellers might tend to be overcautious. The idea of John D in quarantine for 2 weeks with just a computer for company could be interesting for doc2doc...	Apart from the foetal risks a bit more is emerging to suggeat that G-B may be a rare complication - but that can be pretty major. It might have a low mortality in its own right but some of us might well prefer demise to really severe disease and decline ventilation.	The one bit of good that might emerge is that the UK needs to look at its mozzie breeding grounds. They exist in most gardens etc... and it is only a matter of time before we have some of these mosquitos breeding in the UK .-k45b

Hewrote of his concern in the Harvard Review of Public Health (Attaran A,Why Public Health Concerns for Global Spread of Zika Virus Means That Rio de Janeiros 2016 Olympic Games Must Not Proceed Online athttp://harvardpublichealthreview.org/off-the-podium-why-rios-2016-olympic-games-must-not-proceed/ Accessed on 19/5/16)	He is, of course, right that a global event in the infection zone of a new disease will spread it around the world. There are bound to be spectators who are infected and will take it home with them.  But, in this connected world, in which air travel continues to boom, the spread of Zika to the rest of the world is inevitable.  Aedes species of mosquito that carry it are endemic across the tropics and into the southern Mediterrenean countries of Europe. This is the distribution of Ae.Aegypti, known to carry Zika:	and this is the distribution of Ae.albopictus, closely related and thought to also carry the virus.	Rather more widespread, especially in southeast US, Italy and Spain.	I feel that, rather than Ban the Games, Prof.Attaran should be arguing for support from the wealthy nations for those whose public health systems are vestigial, if only in self-interest. Climate chnage will draw the Aedes northwards, perhaps to the Norfolk and English south coast marshes where they once transmitted malaria. None of us shall escape, except possible the Scandanavians and other Boreal nations.	John-ru7b5cbc5eugj1v3cvgtfukzgofi806736k

Today's New Scientist reports that about 500 people in the US have Zika, acquired abroad, and over 800 in Puerto Rico.  Over 150 of those in mainland USA are pregnant. The virus has been found on the Cap Verde islands, on the fringe of Africa.  350 miles from its westernmost edge is further than a mosquito can fly, but that's not how the virus is spreading. It's flying humans that do it, and it's not going to stop now.	The only hope mentioned in the article is that there are two strains of Zika, Asian and African.  The second was the first Zika found, in Uganda in the 40s, and it's probably still endemic but does not cause the microcephalic affect. It may be that the African version confers immunity to the Asian one spreading from South America. Let's hope so.	JOhn-4rz4bye0fphrf4d

Of course human spread will exacerbate the problem but with a bit of global warming these problems may well hit Europe in the future anyway. Just look around at the puddles , stagnant water and garden rain tubs , pools etc... as mosquito breeding grounds and the UK too has the making of an epidemic.	So far have any athletes shown signs of backing out of competing ?	My impression is that public awareness is growing but still has a long way to go - haemorrhagic fevers in Africa have become much more of a personal threat in Europe over the last 30 years as the interest in Ebola showed and the interest each time bird flu problems arise. What I do not think the public has registered is how ill equipped we are to deal with a major epidemic - folk might even die... Cue : blame the government , failure to invest in the NHS etc...-5g2ad

A search on PubMed for "wind spread virus" found 71 hits, and a scan of the abstracts sowed that wind is a possible vector. Animal diseases - foot and mouth which is spread by direct contact, and Bkluetongue (Schallenberg) which is spread by midges - have been accused.  Also, human disease, hand, foot and mouth.   But the distances are tiny, tens of kilometers, and in the HFM outbreak in China, the temperature and humidity also contributed, presumably as particles with virus in/on them dry out.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=wind+spread+virus	I presume, from no knowledge at all, that as malaria has evolved to to use two species to spread itself, other viruses that use animal vectors, like Zika, will have done the same.  Others, that spread by droplet infection will be favoured by resistance to drying out, which an insect vector will protecct them from.  Insects are found almost throughout the troposphere, below 14kms, but mosquitoes are not found above 300 feet http://www.cmcd.org/research/significant-research-projects/flight-height-of-salt-marsh-mosquitoes-during-migration/ so unless unusual conditions carry mosquitoes very high, only human carriers can be able to take the virus across wide sea passages.

Insulin deficiency worsens with the natural progression of type 2 diabetes, explaining the escape from oral antihyperglycemic agents and the need for exogenous insulin therapy (2).	The use of external pumps in patients with type 2 diabetes is a recent practice compared with that in type 1 diabetes, and its use is still debated. In only a few countries, such as in France and Israel, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external pump is an alternative in type 2 diabetes that the health authorities have allowed for reimbursement. The rationale for using pump therapy was first suggested by its use in case reports of type 2 diabetes with extreme insulin resistance and poor glycemic control (36). In such patients, insulin was administered transiently by intravenous insulin infusion allowing lower mean glucose level despite a 40% reduction of insulin requirements. The sequential use of 4-week intravenous insulin infusion followed by 1-year CSII in a group of patients with type 2 diabetes patients poorly controlled despite very high insulin requirements allowed a dramatic reduction of HbA1c (3%, 9 mmol/mol), while insulin requirements were reduced by one-third. Such beneficial effects of CSII were attributed to increased insulin sensitivity assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study (7). These observations raised the question as to whether insulin continuous administration by a pump device gives an advantage compared with the conventional approach of insulin intensification by multiple daily injections (MDIs). The evidence base is still under debate and will be discussed in this review	Abstract 2	Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a promising therapy, but the clinical evidence supporting it is mixed. Large randomized controlled trials have concluded that CSII was equivalent to multiple daily injections (MDI), whereas smaller trials have concluded that CSII was superior. Simpler insulin regimens of CSII have been investigated for T2DM and may lead to improved outcomes. Future directions in this area include simpler insulin pumps and the use of concentrated insulins (U-500), neither of which has left the feasibility stage of research. CSII may be appropriate for some people with T2DM, especially those for whom MDI therapy has failed.-yk0eq1ea52660r5i015anel4aea

An old medical and life adage.The last diabetic patient on continuous subcutaneous insulin pump infusion (CSII) that I saw was a 22 years old young lady with type 1 diabetes since 9 years old, a wealthy medical student with a private doctor and using CSII for 6 years. Her HBA1C was stable at 6.0% and that information was enough for me regarding her glycaemic control. I was called because of a recent appearence of microalbuminuria (mean of 52 mg of albumin/g of creatinine on two consecutive spots morning urines). My requested ABPM showed normal BP levels but a small decrease in the systolic BP decrease during sleep. So I started her on ramipril 10 mg at night with a follow-up after about 1 year with me as her BP and albuminuria doctor. I advised her private doctor to bring her HBA1C closest to normal "as possible" without Hypos (easy task right?). I will move on with my opinion in the next post.-0x1a979gma

In a few words, CSII has been delivered so far to an elite of type 1 diabetic subjects - NICE guidance on this is freely available on google for those interested.When I read the post by Alaminum I felt weird, then he sent to us some abstracts....then I took a bit of my time to look a bit more into this. So Lets go:- "Medtronic" has one of the most traditional and effective pace-makers on the market for a long time. Recently its renal denervation catheter for resistant hypertension was got out of production after brilliant preliminary results from two non-randomised clinical studies were followed by a negative prospective double blind and sham randomised clinical trial, published in the NEJM - contrary to previous brilliant results the multicenter double blind and sham prospective trial showed that the technique of renal denervation for resistant hyprtension was indeed safe but had No effectiveness.- The CSII Headquarters for type 2 diabetes is in France, and is being supported by Medtronic, Abbott, Ely Lilly, and Novo Nordisk. This is good news because a big change in the paradigms and technology of type 2 diabetes care demand high financial investments&support from device companies and insulin, or insulin analogues pharmaceutical companies, the major financial interests looking for this methodology to succeed. Conversely, we need being also very critical, because not always what is more expensive for patients or healthcare systems mean better outcomes; just see what happen frequently with newer anti-diabetic drugs, more expensive and more toxic with no better clinically relevant outcomes.In the next post I will give my final comments on this.Dear Alaminum, its not my fault! you posted quite a complex issue here.All Best,Joey-p47c7eo00pweb

Methods Patients on pump therapy at a single paediatric tertiary hospital were matched to patients treated by injections on the basis of age, duration of diabetes and HbA1c at the time of pump start. HbA1c, anthropometric data, episodes of severe hypoglycaemia and rates of hospitalisation for DKA were collected prospectively.Results 	A total of 345 patients on pump therapy were matched to controls on injections. The mean age, duration of diabetes at pump start and length of follow-up were 11.4 (3.5), 4.1 (3.0) and 3.5 (2.5) years, respectively. The mean HbA1c reduction in the pump cohort was 0.6% (6.6 mmol/mol). This improved HbA1c remained significant throughout the 7 years of follow-up. Pump therapy reduced severe hypoglycaemia from 14.7 to 7.2 events per 100 patient-years (p <0.001). In contrast, severe hypoglycaemia increased in the non-pump cohort over the same period from 6.8 to 10.2 events per 100 patient-years. The rate of hospitalisation for DKA was lower in the pump cohort (2.3 vs 4.7 per 100 patient-years, p =0.003) over the 1,160 patientyears of follow-up.Conclusions/interpretation 	This is the longest and largest study of insulin pump use in children and demonstrates that pump therapy provides a sustained improvement in glycaemic control, and reductions of severe hypoglycaemia and hospitalisation for DKA compared with a matched cohort using injections-sy5d927mlao

I really like finding a cure for patients and so much of modern medicine is treating surrogate measurements to reduce risk rather than trying to cure conditions. With more preventative medication elderly people tend to be on multiple medications and so the risk of side effects is higher.	I would probably ask the patient what he wanted. Did he have symptoms that troubled him or did he want to reduce his risks. I would ask him about his attitude to medication and whether he would accept side effects if they produced a significant reduction in risk from disabling illness and if medication was significantly lightly to reduce mortality	I have now retired from full time General Practice and I only do some GP locums in an OOH centre. I still very much enjoy the work, but I do miss some of the continuity of care. When I was a partner, if I had a worry with a diabetic patient had a partner who was very good with dealing with diabetic medications and I would have probably deferred to him. He unlike me was fairly keen on gliptins [DPP4] and would have probably gone for option 2.

I really like finding a cure for patients and so much of modern medicine is treating surrogate measurements to reduce risk rather than trying to cure conditions. With more preventative medication elderly people tend to be on multiple medications and so the risk of side effects is higher.	I would probably ask the patient what he wanted. Did he have symptoms that troubled him or did he want to reduce his risks. I would ask him about his attitude to medication and whether he would accept side effects if they produced a significant reduction in risk from disabling illness and if medication was significantly lightly to reduce mortality	I have now retired from full time General Practice and I only do some GP locums in an OOH centre. I still very much enjoy the work, but I do miss some of the continuity of care. When I was a partner, if I had a worry with a diabetic patient had a partner who was very good with dealing with diabetic medications and I would have probably deferred to him. He unlike me was fairly keen on gliptins [DPP4] and would have probably gone for option 2. With a chat about possible side effect of gliptins and a review appointment and a check on his blood tests.

He lost 4 kg of body weight (and has been keeping it), his BMI came down to 30, his LDL-Cholesterol has been now stable at about the 80ths mg/dL, he has been exercising (regular walking plus going to the gym at least once a week with a personal trainer), and eating a mediterranean diet. Oh yes, lifestyle behaviour is the best medicine (with no side-effects) that I have seen in my life!- But there is indeed one thing that his GP could not figure out yet.......His HBA1C started to slowly go up from the low 8ths since about 12 months ago.....and now seems to have stabilized at the low 9ths...And his GP has no idea why this is happening, because actually he would be expecting quite the opposite to occur with his HBA1C levels!- So, what is going on with this mans glycaemic control?

She had an anterior-wall myocardial infarction 18 months ago.												For several years, her glycated hemoglobin levels were consistently between 6.4% and 6.9% while she was treated with metformin (1000 mg twice daily) and insulin glargine (28 units every night). However, about 6 months ago, she started having repeated asymptomatic hypoglycemic episodes; her insulin dose was lowered from 28 to 18 units every night, and the hypoglycemic episodes ceased. During the past 3 months, her fasting glucose levels have ranged from 92 to 130 mg/dL in the morning and from 115 to 145 mg/dL before lunch and dinner.												The patient has no symptoms or signs to suggest diabetic neuropathy. She has had stable mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy for many years. Her serum creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL (reference range, 0.61.1), and her urine albumin level, relative to her urine creatinine level, is below the level of detection.																	What is the best next step in managing this patient's type 2 diabetes?

Hi Frank, how are you? You have certainly told Mr. W. why I am here right? Right Joey!- Mr. W. your EKG&Echo are normal. Your 6 minute walking test is also normal. And congratulations for your new healthy lifestyle since you have gone to the diabetic multidisciplinary team for about 18 months now!- After that, Joey Rio did a physical exam on Mr. W. that was completely normal except for an abdominal circumpherence of 110 cm, which meant to Joey Rio that Mr. W. still had the metabolic syndrome. - Mr. W. you are the owner of your whole body and mind, so you will have the final word about how to move on with your overall diabetes treatment. I have 3 options to suggest you today. I will do it by a DESCENDING order of my favourites, please interrupt-me anytime you wish. But All 3 options will be acceptable ones for your bit further glycaemic control!- My third and last suggested option for you would be a new class of anti-diabetic drugs known as DPP-4 Inhibitors or Gliptins. These are "fashion" new drugs, and have been gaining popularity! But I must warn you that a strong study that we call as systematic review&meta-analysis published this February 17th in BMJ (www.bmj.com) have shown that these drugs may indeed increase the risk for in-hospital admissions for heart failure in those diabetics who have cardiovascular disease-and you have hypertension; or those who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors-and you have diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidaemia; which in my opinion raises a red flag for these still new drugs. http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i610 . An admission for heart failure I would not consider a big deal for you, but thats your choice!- My second option suggested for you would be adding to metformin an old class of drugs known as sulphonylureas. Yes they have been around for decades and are generic and quite cheap! Extended release glicazide comes in 30 mg pills, the dose range is 30 to 120 mg/day in the morning. For you I think 30 mg would be enough, and with your normal renal function the chances of hypoglycaemic episodes would be really small!- My first and favourite option for you would be not to add or reduce any anti-diabetic drug...because I have noticed that your HBA1C started to increase some months after you changed a weaker statin (simvastatin) for a much stronger statin (rosuvastatin). So, I propose to you start taking a small dose - 10 mg - of a less diabetogenic statin - atorvastatin; than the more diabetogenic rosuvastatin. So my diagnosis for you Mr. W. is that you had a STATIN-INDUCED WORSENING GLYCAEMIC CONTROL.- But Doctor Joey, it will not make my LDL goes up again? Never mind with that Mr. W. Treat the Risk Not the Target! Dr. Frank will give further details about this concept. And Dr. Frank just happily smiled to Mr. W., reassuring him.....So what do you decide Mr. W.?- Give-me a week to think about these 3 options...... 10 days later Mr. W. called Dr. Frank to tell that he decided to Not Adding Any New&Old Anti-Diabetic Drug and that he had stopped rosuvastatin 20mg/day and was already taking atorvastatin 10 mg/day. Further 8 months later Mr. Waldman had lost an extra 1.5 kg; his HBA1C went down to 8.2%. His GP called-me and I told him, if he continues this way you will have to reduce his Metformin dose!Thanks everybody for your opinions and votes, this has been a high level debate.All Best,Joey-ir9gpl67aciztn0a3e6dxa1572e

The increase in HBA1C levels and also in Physician reported new-onset diabetes in this Healthy, Non-Diabetic population were both statistically significant (p<0.001), and were replicated in all later systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Nobody knows for sure the exact mechanism or mechanisms for this diabetogenic effect of statins; what seems consistent is that the higher the potency of a statin and the higher its dose, the higher will be its diabetogenic effect! Being Pravastatin - a weaker, but still effective statin- is one of the less diabetogenic statins (And It could also be used for our patient here, but low-dose atorvastatin worked well).This challenging debate is still open for various opinions!!All Best,Joey-7l3a5jt12f

Miriam E TuckerApril05,2016	Add Other Topics(updated April 6) The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a new alert about the potential for increased risk for heart failure in patients taking the type 2 diabetes drugs saxagliptin (Onglyza, AstraZeneca) and alogliptin (Nesina, Takeda).The FDAannouncedthat new warnings will be added to the labels of the two dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP-4) inhibitor drugs, cautioning that they may increase the risk for heart failure, particularly in patients who already have cardiovascular or kidney disease.			"Healthcare professionals should consider discontinuing medications containing saxagliptin and alogliptin in patients who develop heart failure and monitor their diabetes control," an FDA statement notes. "If a patient's blood sugar level is not well-controlled with their current treatment, other diabetes medicines may be required."			Combination products containing the two agents are also affected, including saxagliptin and metformin extended release (Kombiglyze XR, AstraZeneca ), alogliptin and metformin (Kazano, Takeda), and alogliptin and pioglitazone (Oseni, Takeda).			The move follows an FDA internalsafety reviewof two large cardiovascular-outcomes trials of patients with cardiovascular disease and a recommendation for the label revision by the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee during an April 2015 hearing.			At that meeting, the panel expressed greater concern about heart failure for saxagliptin than for alogliptin, but because the mechanism is not clear and the two belong to the same class, the majority opted to recommend the warning on both labels.			However, in the interim, a third large cardiovascular-outcomes trial with another DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin (Januvia, Merck), theTrial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin(TECOS), showed no signal of heart failure at all in type 2 diabetes patients who received the drug.SAVOR and EXAMINE, Compared With TECOS			Results of the two studies that prompted the FDA safety review Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes MellitusThrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53(SAVOR-TIMI 53) andExamination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care(EXAMINE)  were first presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) meeting in 2013 and later published in theNew England Journal of Medicine.			In the saxagliptin trial, which included 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease, there was no overall risk for cardiovascular events, but there was a 27% increase (3.5% vs 2.8%) in the rate of the first event of hospitalization for heart failure and a potential increased risk for all-cause mortality. Risk factors included a history of heart failure or kidney impairment.			In EXAMINE, which included a total of 5380 patients, 3.9% of patients receiving drug were hospitalized for heart failure vs 3.3% of patients receiving placebo. Although the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.19), heart failure was not an end point of the study.			TheTECOS resultswith sitagliptin, the DPP-4 inhibitor that has been on the market for longest, were first presented at the ADA meeting last year and simultaneously published in theNew England Journal of Medicine; the absence of any heart-failure signal was confirmed witha deeper dive into the resultspresented at the ESC meeting in September 2015.All Best,Joey-l31hdh70aja77fna62dzb2mxeta2f2fw1bna8ntd4a3062e6y955nspba78f3g

Advice about lifestyle modification is also required. As the patient is 72 years old, use of gliptins may result in difficult side effects.	Posted by LiaqatYes, I would say, not disregarding the other colleagues opinions, that this is a wise comment from Liaqat, because:1.- FDA rules for the release of newer antidiabetic drugs still rely upon namely on surrogates of disease markers and soft outcomes like reducing HBA1C levels, and OnlyNot Increasing cardiovascular diseases hard end point like myocardial infarctions, strokes, amputations, end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular deaths, quality of life issues, PLUS the results of Post Marketing Surveillance Studies.- This FDA (and other regulatory agencies also) relaxed rules have proved many times, dubious and dangerous.2. - We should also be always aware that the old and elderly diabetics are the most prone diabetics to develop drug toxicities....So we indeed should try to avoid using&proposing Polypharmacy to them.PS. A bit further I will talk about the alleged safety of Sitagliptin, which I indeed think may be a Biased Safety!But before that perhaps would be great listening to the comments of others (Dr. Chid? Who else?) about their own experiences with DPP-4 Inhibitors or about these recent Warns of the FDA about their alleged "Cardiovascular Safety".All Best,Joey-172bxt6h1dw03528ceyqa

It is a short-acting meglitinide.	Posted by ArrheniusDear Arrhenius:Thanks for your comment that is correct Repaglinide is a short-acting sulphonylurea-like agent, and Gianluigi Passerini is also correct about proposing its use to our patient under discussion.Every single doctor has its own sulphonysurea of preference. My favourite one is a short-acting one glicazide in the extended release form, my second favourite one is an old long-acting sulphonylurea: glibenclamide, because it is given for free at my country, and most of my patients that are taking it never wanted to get rid of it!Repaglinide I do not use (but respect those who make it) because I do not find user friendly taking it at every meal, its numerous drug to drug interactions, and a certain propensity for hypoglycaemic episodes.Glad that our case brought so many aspects into debate. Sulphonylureas, in my humble opinion have a long life in type 2 diabetes treatment!All Best,Joey.-623a2u185731a

But they are not sulfonylureas. They do not contain a sulfa group, for example, which makes them acceptable for those patients who might have a severe sulfa allergy.-

Posted by ArrheniusDear Arrhenius:Thank you, once more, for your smart comment.But I think that both, you Arrhenius, and Gianluigi, are right. Let-me try summarizing what I think about this, and of course you are not obliged to agree with me only because I have formulated this question. I will go through it by numbers, to make it more synthetic:1. When we have a common and complex disease state like type 2 diabetes (and hypertension or heart failure) with lots of drugs for the treatment, it means that we do not know a lot about many essential aspects of them.2. From a strictly chemical (or biochemical standpoint) you are right. But, from a clinical stand point, repaglinide works like a sulphonylurea (major mechanism of both=increase in pancreatic insulin secretion). See this Joslin guide for patients where both are put together in the same sort of oral hypoglycaemic drug class:http://www.joslin.org/info/sulfonylurea_agents_oral_hypoglycemic_agents.html3. As an example for this paradigm are diuretics in the treatment of hypertension. We have the thiazide diuretic (=Hidrochlorothiazide) and the thiazide-like diuretics such as Chlortalidone, Indapamide, Amiloride, and others. They all are included in the same class of anti-hypertensive and diuretic agents albeit having very different chemical structures - BUT they have in common acting in a smooth way across all or almost all parts of the tubular nephron.So, the same way as with thiazide diuretics, regarding the clinical viewpoint, we have the classical sulphonylureas (ex: glibenclamide, glicazide) and the sulphonylurea-like drugs such as repaglinide, acting through their major common pharmacological pathways of increasing insulin secretion.Allergy to sulphonylureas still do occur but have been less common with the newer generations of sulphonylureas, and I have never seen it with the glicazide extended release formulation.PS: So far, a great clinical debate here!All Best,Joey-t66d5dwh6o5jm22059d

They looked also at episodes of hypoglycaemia, and uncontrolled hypeglycaemia. I have read it once, will do it again. Was writen in a sometimes complicated way to the reader and, I do think made few wrong conclusions about sulphonylureas (got a harsh response from a reader because of that, they had the "obligation" to answer, so they did it!, and think that all of you will learn a lot reading this response as I also did). In the companion and well writen editorial there is also a more or less "subtle" critique to the way the results regarding the sulphonylureas were reported. Here it is the link to this cohort paper: http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i1450Main Conclusions from this Cohort:1- Metformin + Sulphonylurea: Most Hypoglycaemic two oral drug combinations.2. Metformin + Sulphonylurea + Glitazones: Most Hypoglycaemic three drugs combinations but the Most Effective for Prevention of Blindness (Humm.......interesting, not?).3.Etc, etc...., etc.....Read the paper.After this cohort it came as a recommended reading a very old paper with a first generation sulphonylurea that is not anymore in the market.

Advice about lifestyle modification is also required. As the patient is 72 years old, use of gliptins may result in difficult side effects.	Posted by LiaqatDear Colleagues:Liaqat posted this at the start of our discussion. I think Liaqat made a correct statement.This recent weeks my e-mail box has been heavily loaded with papers orchestrating the greater benefits of namely DPP-4 Inhibitors and pioglytazone when compared to the "extremely" high rikk of hypoglycaemia of sulphonylureas. It would be quite long going through mechanisms of hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. For now, to be short I would say that it can be quite rare with a moderate skilled doctor and an extended release form of a sulphonylurea like glicazide.This PHARMA movement now reminds-me the late 90ths/early 2000ths when newer anti-hypertensives (mostly brand new names of expensive angiotensin II receptor blockers) were being released into the market; almost all against the villain at that time: the old, safe and reliable AMLODIPINE. Well, how do I treat my hypertensive patients now in 2016: With generic amlodipine, extended release nifedipine, generic beta-blockers, generic ACE-Inhibitors, generic losartan, generic indapamide, generic chlortalidone. The old amlodipine is still there, cheap, effective, safe in hypertension; as well as sulphonylureas in type 2 diabetes.Conversely, everyday, we are just seeing one more serious side-effects (because of recently previous rushing of delivery into the market) with the newer anti-diabetics, like severely painful acute arthritis, sometimes requiring hospitalizations with DPP-4-Inhibitors:http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm459579.htmWe will probably see more severe side effects with gliptins, but not with sulphonylureas - we have already seen all of them with the sulphonylureas.All Best,Joey.-m55cy9dx08526a

Posted by elshiekhHello elshiekh:Great to see that your first post to doc2doc being in the Diabetes forum. I understand your point here, perhaps not agreeing with you.We, doctors, many times and for a number of reasons, set up unrealistic HBA1C or Fasting Plasma Glucose TARGETS for our type 2 diabetics already with or more than 55 years old. Please take a look at the extremely low prevalence&incidence rates of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, in the group of patients with "not-intensive glycaemic control" with the use of an extended release formulation of an old sulphonylurea - glicazide - in a prospective, large, multicenter, and randomised clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2008, ADVANCE, one of the best recent clinical trials in type2 diabetes. N Engl J Med 2008;358:2560-72.What I mean is that maybe the major culprit for those diabetics with 55 or above years old with many hypoglycaemic episodes are our glycaemic targets (= intensive glycaemic control); and not the anti-diabetic drugs per-se, being them the old sulphonylureas or the newer anti-diabetic ones.All Best,Joey-1r3byd4g1hvss44361b

Posted by LiaqatYes, I would say, not disregarding the other colleagues opinions, that this is a wise comment from Liaqat, because:1.- FDA rules for the release of newer antidiabetic drugs still rely upon namely on surrogates of disease markers and soft outcomes like reducing HBA1C levels, and OnlyNot Increasing cardiovascular diseases hard end point like myocardial infarctions, strokes, amputations, end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular deaths, quality of life issues, PLUS the results of Post Marketing Surveillance Studies.- This FDA (and other regulatory agencies also) relaxed rules have proved many times, dubious and dangerous.2. - We should also be always aware that the old and elderly diabetics are the most prone diabetics to develop drug toxicities....So we indeed should try to avoid using&proposing Polypharmacy to them.PS. A bit further I will talk about the alleged safety of Sitagliptin, which I indeed think may be a Biased Safety!But before that perhaps would be great listening to the comments of others (Dr. Chid? Who else?) about their own experiences with DPP-4 Inhibitors or about these recent Warns of the FDA about their alleged "Cardiovascular Safety".All Best,Joey			Posted by Joey Rio	Respected Sir,	Thank you very much.My experience with DPP4inhibitors are limited,but what I can say is that I have not come across patients taking this drug with symptoms suggestive of Pancreatitis and hypoglycemia.I don't give it to diabetic patients with CAD.I feel one can treat a patient  with this drug if his sugar level is not getting controlled and Insulin is going to be the next option.

Salt is a very important issue in diabetic and CKD hypertension.				This is what I would try with her:				- Severe dietary salt restriction.		- Get rid of any Anti-Inflammatory drugs.		- Keep the Enalapril on top of the 40 mg/day dose.		- Add Furosemide 80 to 160 mg in two divided doses per day in addition to the spironolactone.		- Change the Nevibolol for Carvedilol, just because of my larger personal experience with carvedilol and also for a higher dose range with Carvedilol (I could begin with, for example, 6,25 mg twice a day increasing up to 12,5 or even 25 mg twice a day, in just a few weeks).	- I would definetely give another chance to amlodipine, 10 mg at bedtime. Together with High dose furosemide, things can get better.		And so, He would be on 4 classes of anti-hypertensive drugs, with nice doses:	Enalapril, Amlodipine, Carvedilol, Furosemide, and Spironolactone.		Hope it helps,		All best,		Joey-it3a6czb16cyeuap

I would first stabilize blood glucose ... mainly with insulin ...naturally multiple regime.For BP to be <130/90 ... ACE, ARB, (with close monitoring of electrolytes) CCB, B-blokers, diurteics, with low salt and low protein diet are indicated - as tolerated to maximum doses. Other complicating co-morbidities like anaemia, hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, etc. should be treated with erythropoietin, calcium, vit D.

A significant point that I have noted in your comments above is that this middle-aged patient, with chronic disease burden, is from low socio-economic strata. Against such a background, I would work up this case as best suits patients autonomy and beneficence, including financial constraints, and not by the dictates of the EBM or guidelines, which will certainly be a tall order to follow for this poor patient. I strongly believe in the concept of patient-centered approach, and I certainly appreciate your approach  not to push things at first meeting till you are certain of compliance with drug regime. And based on similar logic, I suppose, I will plan investigations, if they add value to his management.  With a history of PVD / amputation, one may like to rule out PAN, or vasculitis, by tests such as ANCA, and a biopsy; but again, as the disease is well advanced, will it be beneficial? If positive, again the role of steroids / immuno modulators has to be assessed, because of the added immunodeficiency risk and upset diabetic control. I would prefer to just manage his lipid profile a bit more aggressively with Atorvastatin only ( for other statins dose adjustment is recommended, depending on creatinine clearance and GFR), add cilostazol, aspirin, PPI, in a step-wise regime, as best tolerated by him; but the cornerstone of his management is  a fairly well glycemic control with insulin. Your plan of Lantus insulin with graded dose of Apidra rapid insulin as per blood glucose values is fine, and FBG values around 100 and PP / random around 150 must be targeted without hypos; however, variable response to insulin as CKD progresses needs careful monitoring. If the total dose of insulin is escalating, then a small dose of glipizide (which dose not need dose adjustment in renal insufficiency), is a good option. Although FDA has permitted gliptins  Onglyza- in moderate to severe renal impairment, including ESRD, its high cost is a deterrent in this particular patient.  As for anti-hypertensives  beta-blockers should be excluded as there is h/o PVD; ace/arb with loop diuretics, and since he can not tolerate CCB due to pedal edema, well titrated alfa-blockers and centrally acting 2-adrenoceptor agonists may play a positive role in controlling resistant hypertension. Just a bit more counselling with respect to their side effects will enhance his cooperation in drug-dosage adherence.  Another point that I must state is that - over here, many patients, poor or rich alike , take varieties of herbal products containing heavy metals for many diseases ( IHD, DM, arthritis, cirrhosis of liver, HIV, CKD, etc) in the hope of a magic cure. And unless you question them directly, this goes unnoticed, and the truth comes out when its too late for some remedy. So, this aspect has to be probed, especially in the early stages of consultation.  With all the tools that we presently have to deal with CKD with DM and hypertension, its possible to delay further renal deterioration, and to achieve goal, whole-hearted physician-patient relationship is extremly important.-q05f8mm5aaa78fzeq3392hu9367aeyapp3ey79cpkb2wqvlh55c5w3c060r

Comments are welcome.Posted by YaronDears Yaron and Csm:You are right about the dangers with Hyperkalemia. High dose Furosemide should antagonize that as long as the patient has enough diuresis and serum creatinine keeps below 3.0. Any way K should be closely monitored. But perhaps espirolactone could be left away from his treatment at this point. But I think high dose furosemide is a must for him.As Csm suggested, I also think, Atorvastatin is really a good shot for him.Regarding his Peripheral Vascular Disease, the first generation beta-blockers are clearly contra-indicated, but that is not the case for the newer ones as carvedilol.Now, let-me call you both the attention for this interesting recent article written by a nephrologist from the United States about diabetic patients with Chronic Kidney Disease, using much higher than usual doses of Lisinopril (up to 80mg/day) in single daily administrations. The authors obtained a measurably good effect on blood pressure and albuminuria. But Potassium should be closely monitored.I found it a really interesting and new way of treating those high-risk diabetic patients such as yours. The abstract Follows.Hope it helps. All Best. Joey.Journal of Investigative MedicineISSN:1081-5589(C) 2010 American Federation for Medical ResearchEffective Antihypertensive Strategies for High-Risk Patients WithDiabetic Nephropathypg. 950-956DOI: 10.231/JIM.0b013e3181ff46a5AB Aim: Clinical guidelines recommend blood pressure (BP) lowering and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition to slow kidney disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy. This study's purpose was to determine whether an antihypertensive regimen including a maximally dosed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor could safely achieve target BP in indigent, predominantly minority patients with this disease. Methods: We studied 81 hypertensive adults (52% Hispanic and 31% African American) with nephropathy attributed to type 1 or 2 diabetes during the run-in period of a randomized controlled trial. The subjects received lisinopril titrated to 80 mg daily and additional antihypertensives to target a systolic BP (SBP) lower than 130 mm Hg. Blood pressure and serum potassium level were measured weekly, and a 4-gram sodium diet was prescribed. The primary outcome variable was SBP change from screening to randomization. Success in achieving SBP goal, change in urine albumin-creatinine ratio, hyperkalemia (serum potassium >=5.5 mmol/L) and hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg) were also analyzed. Results: The median SBP decreased from 144 to 133 mm Hg (median change, -9.6%.) Fifty-eight (71%) achieved goal SBP during run-in. The median UACR decreased from 206.8 to 112.7 mg/mmol (median change, -42.7%). The UACR reduction correlated with SBP reduction. Seventeen subjects experienced hyperkalemia responsive to dietary/medical management. Two subjects experienced hypotension responsive to medication adjustments. Conclusion: A regimen using a maximally dosed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is safe and effective for achieving BP goal in high-risk, predominantly minority patients with diabetic nephropathy. Implementing this regimen necessitates close monitoring of serum potassium level. (C) 2010 American Federation for Medical Research-3z6kk7atflh

I am late enterant. So much discussed so beautifully. Yaron has given the history in installments which is good.I think we must set two goals first in this patient.Desired: HBA1C = < 6.5 % Fasting = < 100 mg/dl Random = < 140 mg/dl B.P = < 110/80 Hb = 9.2 gm; good enough.In assessment of renal function Creatinine clearance should be the guide. One good point about prognosis: This patient still has lot of renal reserve as so much inuslin is being needed.I would have gone with combination of regular and NPH insulin cosidering socioeconomic class.About antihypertensives/Pedal edema is harmless. Secondly while adding frusamide and already being used ACE, it should not be limiting factor, although tachycardia can be a discomfort.I would go with following regime;Frosamide 40 mg 8 hourlyAmlodipine 5 mg 12 hourlyRamipril 10 mg bidCarvidolol (Nebivolol) 12.5 bidIf this does not achieve target BP then I have something else in store.-09yaaaaaqaaaaawaaaaavaaaaaeaaaaaaalaaaaadaaaaaaa

The agents appear safe and they virtually eliminate the risk of hypoglycemia. That makes then particularly useful in elderly patients. There are no studies demonstrating significant therapeutic advantages among these agents or differences in their safety profiles. There are pharmacologic effects that should result in improvement in cardiovascular outcomes, but so far no convincing clinical evidence to substantiate such a benefit. Their major drawback is that they are expensive. Since they have little advantage over the older agents regarding efficacy and they are more expensive, I remain unconvinced that they should be by default second line agents.

The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 19802013.	Methods	We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).	Findings	Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 288% (95% UI 284293) to 369% (363374) in men, and from 298% (293302) to 380% (375385) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 238% (229247) of boys and 226% (217236) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 81% (7786) to 129% (123135) in 2013 for boys and from 84% (8188) to 134% (130139) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50% in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down.	Interpretation	Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.		COMMENT: While we in the West were wringing our hands about the increase in overweight and obesity in our own countries, we or atleast I for one did not appreciate just how widespread and pervasive this epidemic was. Given this worldwide increase and acceleration of obesity, the calculations for future prevalence of obesity must surely be underestimates. As if the data presented were not depressing enough, the statement that no country has yet succeeded in reversing this trend is an indication of the uphill battle we have before us.-086f41cjgkf0241ata5a41inadigdwgdigd0igdrgd9nfcigd4afcigd082106wtwa7tua8au2j3a0pta5bt

And sugary pop consumption is also decreasing in that age group. Let's hold our breath. Here's the abstract:	Prevalence of Childhood and Adult Obesity in the United States, 2011-2012JAMA. 2014;311(8):806-814. doi:10.1001/jama.2014.732.	ABSTRACTImportance More than one-third of adults and 17% of youth in the United States are obese, although the prevalence remained stable between 2003-2004 and 2009-2010.Objective To provide the most recent national estimates of childhood obesity, analyze trends in childhood obesity between 2003 and 2012, and provide detailed obesity trend analyses among adults.Design, Setting, and Participants Weight and height or recumbent length were measured in 9120 participants in the 2011-2012 nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Main Outcomes and Measures In infants and toddlers from birth to 2 years, high weight for recumbent length was defined as weight for length at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. In children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific CDC BMI-for-age growth charts. In adults, obesity was defined as a BMIgreater than or equal to30. Analyses of trends in high weight for recumbent length or obesity prevalence were conducted overall and separately by age across 5 periods (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012).Results In 2011-2012, 8.1% (95% CI, 5.8%-11.1%) of infants and toddlers had high weight for recumbent length, and 16.9% (95% CI, 14.9%-19.2%) of 2- to 19-year-olds and 34.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-37.9%) of adults (age-adjusted) aged 20 years or older were obese. Overall, there was no significant change from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012 in high weight for recumbent length among infants and toddlers, obesity in 2- to 19-year-olds, or obesity in adults. Tests for an interaction between survey period and age found an interaction in children (P=.03) and women (P=.02). There was a significant decrease in obesity among 2- to 5-year-old children (from 13.9% to 8.4%; P=.03) and a significant increase in obesity among women aged 60 years and older (from 31.5% to 38.1%; P=.006).Conclusions and Relevance Overall, there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. Obesity prevalence remains high and thus it is important to continue surveillance.-hw1elcxa9ong2imh70awy670436dya75ebrb8hb6hb

The UK now accepts that 10% of our budget will go on obesity - more than the entire budget for General Practice. The epidemic has been arising fairly remorselessly and has been well publicised. We should stop thinking that we will be able to make appreciable inroads now and plan on how much extra tax will be needed for this. We will of course wrap it up by saying it is for extra nurses or whatever.	Society has just acquiesced and adapted even to the point of disadvantaging those who have tried to maintain a BMI under 25. Diabetologists are not blameless - perhaps they should have been flagging up these problems politically rather than just trying to grab resources for care of the end disease? What will they do if everyone becomes thin (as we now refer to those with a normal BMI) overnight.... are there enough with Type 1 to keep them all in employment? As things are they need have no worries.-xj2a

When I was growing up the most popular radio and later TV shows were sponsored by tobacco companies. I especially remember Your Hit Parade sponsored by Lucky Strike cigarettes and the Arthur Godfrey show sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes, but there were many more. Here is what the Wikipedia says about that era:	The decades in the 20th century prior to World War II consisted primarily of full page, color magazine and newspaper advertisements. Many companies created slogans for their specific cigarettes and also gained endorsements from famous men and women. Some advertisements even contained children or doctors in their efforts to sway new customers to their specific brand. Much of these advertisements sought to make smoking appear fashionable and modern to men and women. Also, since the health effects of smoking weren't entirely proven at this time, the only real opposing argument to smoking was made on moral grounds. However, there were still a substantial amount of doctors and scientists who believed there was a health risk associated with smoking cigarettes.[6] During World War II, cigarettes were included in American soldier's C-rations since many tobacco companies sent the soldiers cigarettes for free. Cigarette sales reached an all time high at this point, as cigarette companies were not only able to get soldiers addicted to tobacco, but specific brands also found a new loyal group of customers as soldiers who smoked their cigarettes returned from the war.	So what happened to change that? First, there was the science that culminated in the 1964 Surgeon Generals Report on Smoking and Health. The report although dated 1964 was actually available earlier. Our Chairman of Medicine, Dr. John Hickam, was on the panel. It may be hard to imagine today, but in the 1960s we smoked in our medical school classes and the projector lighted up the blue haze that surrounded us. Following the report virtually the entire class quit smoking as did the majority of physicians in the US.	It was nearly 20 years from that time until smoking became socially unacceptable to everyone except the 20% of hard cases, mostly lower income and education, that still smoke in the US. However, it would be an error to think that the success of smoking cessation programs was a matter of science and public health messages. The estimated $50 billion tobacco advertising budget dwarfed the public health message budget by a 100-fold.	It was only when the Attorneys General of the various states collaborated with the tort bar that the public health messages received adequate funding via billions of dollars in law suit settlements over the individual states medical expenses for caring for people with smoking-related diseases.	So there are two messages here for those of us concerned about the obesity epidemic. The first is that we need convincing science that the increase in obesity has causal entities that bear responsibility for the epidemic. Within the past few years there have been both scientific studies and lay publications that place the responsibility of this epidemic largely at the feet of the manufactured food industry. Among the most powerful is the book Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us by Michael Moss and the documentary film Super Size Me, a 2004 documentary directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock, an American independent filmmaker. Spurlock's film follows a 30-day period from February 1 to March 2, 2003 during which he ate only McDonald's food. The film documents this lifestyle's drastic effect on Spurlock's physical and psychological well-being, and explores the fast food industry's corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit.	The second is that we need to institute measures that make the manufacture and marketing of these manufactured foods increasing unprofitable, while also making their marketing increasingly socially unacceptable. This will take time and it will not be a short or linear process. Perhaps we need to revisit the Attorneys General strategy of taking to court those who make and sell these foods and make them pay for the resultant medical costs.	While I am not sure that we have the answers yet, we certainly are on our way the defining the question. Einstein is quoted as having said that if he had one hour to save the world he would spend fifty-five minutes defining the problem and only five minutes finding the solution.-c01jld1h95c8cxc3c7i4l0e7une2h8ipu9ba5yx93721kbmba6fq7a535ac1c4xd77b

One of the crucial differences between smoking and obesity is that smokers paid for there health care whereas the obese simply expect others to pick up the bill. I remember the argument that the UK could not afford to ban smoking due to loss of revenue and people surviving longer.	I am surprised that so many were smoking in medical classes in the 1960s - it suggests an analogy with obese folk not facing up to the fact until someone tells them they are obese. I think in the UK smoking was already accepted medically as "a bad thing" by then. (One of my teachers was reported to have grabbed a packet of cigarettes from a patient and jumped on them). Officially until relatively late in the day , UK coroners might refuse to accept a death certificate blaming smoking. And we still behave with a 2-faced dishonesty that is mind -boggling , bearing in mind the current policies to oblige some other countries to allow tobacco to be pushed - those seen as non-western do not count when profits are concerned. It is all remarkably reminiscent of the old opium wars and selling weapons etc...	There are a number of reasons why doctors choose not to smoke - one is the simple self-centred approach about their own health. Others I thnk are concerned about setting an example. The latter to some extent extended to having alcohol at day-time meetings - this was first discouraged and then discontinued. We have remained very ambivalent about setting an example in terms of exercise and obesity. There are some very obese , very good doctors out there , but perhaps a simple policy that at some stage -say 20 years hence - morbid obesity would be seen as contrindication to a career in medical care , would not go amiss. And that should apply as of now to those who appear in the media talking about healthy lifestyles etc.. - particularly to those involved in running the health services.-xi4cve

My memories of smoke-filled student days are similar to yours. Even the teachers smoked in classes. Speaking as someone who has never smoked, the bans on public place smoking here have greatlyenhanced life.	There isa disconnectbetween academic research and Government policies. If administrations are fighting change they demand unreasonable levels of proof but if, often for dubious reasons, certain policies are being pushed, the need for evidence can be waived. In the case of the NHS reforms this has been described as 'policy-based evidence making.'	I would suggest that evidence for the causes and effects of worldwide obesity is easily enough for national and global action. Few countries seem to be able to assess risk very effectively. Callanything a threat to national security and all other rights can be trampled but problems such as obesity that carry the same or higher real risks are treated very differently and we have discussedsome reasons for that.	Cynically, I guess you might say that the obesity epidemic is eventually going to be self-limiting because of its effects on mortality but the costs and misery on the way will be huge. I might have to check the source but I've been told that there are now more overweight than underweight people in the world. We therefore have the strange reality that, in a generation, the overriding problemof feeding the starving could be reversed. Countering myths might be oneplace to start. The problem is no longer one ofproducing enough food to feed the starving, it's oneofredistribution.-066brcvb1golm4c7ltilcf0r8hvesdyb4ap6a6cc

Hitler hated tobacco smoking (despite once being a heavy smoker) and he banned smoking on trams, inside government buildings and whilst Wehrmacht soldiers were on duty. Whilst not linking smoking to cancer he once lamented that many good men have been lost to tobacco smoking. He also promised to end tobacco smoking in the military after the war.		The term passive smoking (Passivrauchen) was coined in Nazi Germany. Hitler personally gave financial support to the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren (Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research) at the University of Jena, headed by Karl Astel.Established in 1941, it was the most significant anti-tobacco institute in Nazi Germany.		Franz H. Mller in 1939 and E. Schairer in 1943 first used case-control epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers. In 1939, Mller published a study report in a reputed cancer journal in Germany which claimed that prevalence of lung cancer was higher among smokers.		Restrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products,enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression of masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.		Apart from public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology; specifically, the movement was influenced by concepts of racial hygiene and bodily purity. Nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for the master race to smoke and that tobacco consumption was equal to "racial degeneracy". The Nazis viewed tobacco as a "genetic poison". Racial hygienists opposed tobacco use, fearing that it would "corrupt" the "German germ plasm". Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a vice of the degenerates.		The Nazis claimed that the Jews were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects. The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews. Johann von Leers, editor of the Nordische Welt (Nordic World), during the opening ceremony of the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren in 1941, proclaimed that "Jewish capitalism" was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across Europe. He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in Amsterdam, the principal European entry point of Nicotiana.		Here we are 70 years later still trying to discourage smoking. Whilst the Nazi regime was evil it is interesting to note their awareness of smoking being unhealthy, perhaps not linking it to cancer but using advertising to discourage smoking. However, after the war rates of smoking rose dramatically.		Kirked			References		Borio, Gene (19932003), Tobacco Timeline: The Twentieth Century 1900-1949--The Rise of the Cigarette.		Robert N.

Although there is currently some increased mortality this is usually after the reproductive years. Currently we go to considerable trouble to ensure that obese pmothers can be as fertile as anyone else and there are an increasing number of very big babies with very fat mothers. No expense will be spared to ensure these will be able to survive and reproduce .	It is almost axiomatic in the NHS that everyone must live as long as those who take most care of their health to the point where resources will be re-directed more and more to their care from other groups.	Quite apart from being self-limiting we are marching towards the triumph of the obese. Society is increasingly geared towards catering for them preferenterially. Come starvation conditions they will also have the reserves to help them survive. What you have to decide is whether you wish to join them or risk increasing social isolation.......-le0arx

If we were to reduce the meat intake alone and reduce the consumption of other forms of animal sourced fat in diet, then a solution will be insight.	Fat from animal sources is present in biscuits , Cheese, Chocolate, Indian sweets, and many forms of take away foods.	Obesiety and Diabetes are caused by eating all the above food.	In very simple terms, if people eat what they have prepared themselves at home, they are less likely to suffer from obesity.	two cancers have a direct link to meat consumption. Bowel and Breast.

Why does the food industry hate shoppers so much? Dont live ones buy more stuff in the long term? Interestting how certain supermarket chains also sell coffins and cremation services.

From a psychosocial perspective obesity is stigmatised as a sign of laziness. Studies suggested that attitudes towards obese people can include stigmatization, and a general negative attitude. Others postulated value judgement as laziness, stupidity, greed, lack of self-control to obese population. The obese person is left with the stigma and blame to deal with plus obesity.	On the other hand, societies emerge to support normalisation of obesity, including International Size Acceptance Society and NAAFA The epidemic seems to be correlated with the rise of luxurious/sedentary life style + the rise of fast food. There is no clear apparent action taken to combat these.	How many desk workers are instruced to move every hour?	How many countries have lanes for cyclists and promotes cycling for commuting instead of motorized vehicles? or use kick scooters/kick bike for medium short distances?	Any restriction about the amount of fat/sugar/salt in fast food? the latest I recall was that a single unit of soda drinks served cannot exceed 500 ml. I am not aware of any healthy fast food, or fruits/vegetables and salads (no mayo), that are served as fast food.	Are physical education classes in school matching with the WHO recommendations of a healthy life-style? I wonder if physical education classes are obligatory +40 mins per day of mild/moderate exercise. Are there obligatory physical education classes in university? or even at work?	The obesity pandemic seems to be a consequence of an 8-12 hours of sedentary desk work/day with junk food served in-between or eating prior to sleeping plus easy access to cheap fast food, with heavy campaigns of media. Add on the ease of communication and entertainment (from remote controls, to social media, to online gaming, to home cinema).	It is hard to cast all the blame for the obese person, with the rise of theories about leptin, and equally hard to exempt them totally from responsibility.-sj8c

One study stated that moderately overweight elderly people live longer.	The dilemma is that obesity is lost in between tides. The struggle is between normalisation (aka as a normal statistical variance due to its increasing prevalence), medicalisation as a disease, calling it disability, and stigmatisation.	The aetiology is utterly complex from genetics, leptin, drug-induced metabolic syndrome etc. The management is strikingly straight forward, eat less, move more. The application is extremely difficult with high relapse rates, leading to yo-yo weight, weight plateau, and accumulation of abdominal fat. Success is not without a price it leading to skin folds in many areas.	Surgery offers a magic wand but, the relief is temporary. Acceptance is a nice way out, that abolishes the whole problem by denying it. Obesity is a disease, and a precursor to metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension, joint pains, and susceptibility to heart attacks and strokes. This cannot be normal.	Between the magic wand and the diet/exercise combination, a zillion hoax and lie occur with promises of painless diets, devices that does exercises instead of your body doing it, herbals of unknown origin history or even verification.	Within all of these struggles, patients with anorexia nervosa seem to be the most successful ones to lose weight and guide each other via pro-ana websites. Unofrtunately, the risks (death) outweigh any potential benefit.-

Some risk factors are:	A high consumption of beer and food, fatty foods and a lack of physical activity are to be blamed for obesity in some countries.	Another issue is the lack of a healthy lifestyle and diet. Children food products dont contribute to a healthy diet.	Die Welt reported that a "balanced diet is practically impossible. The profit margin for fruits and vegetables was below five percent while confectionery, soft drinks and snacks was at 15% or more.	Marriage has played a factor. Sixty-nine percent of married men are considered overweight while only 43% of single men are considered overweight.

[2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. J Am Coll Cardiol 12 Nov 2013] They were the result of four years of deliberation by a joint panel of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. The changes have been summarized in the BMJ [BMJ 2013;347:f6858]. Highlights of the guidelines can be summarized as follows:		The new risk assessment guideline uses a formula that is based on information easily collected in a primary care setting, such as age, cholesterol concentrations, blood pressure, smoking history, and diagnosis of diabetes. This information can then be entered into equations given in the guideline to create a risk score to guide patient counseling and, if warranted, treatment.		The risk factors used in the formula were age, smoking, high cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes. Unlike previous guidelines, which were based on data only from non-Hispanic white people, the new guidelines include equations that better represent the effect of risk factors for women and African Americans.		The panel also found that four markers may be helpful for patients in whom the need for treatment remained uncertain after evaluation by the guidelines risk equations: coronary artery calcium scores, C reactive protein concentrations, ankle brachial indices, and family history of premature cardiovascular disease.		The guideline on managing blood cholesterol identifies four major groups of people for whom moderate to high intensity treatment with statins is recommended: people who have known cardiovascular disease; those with a low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher; those aged 40-75 who have type 2 diabetes; and those aged 40-75 whose 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as estimated from the risk formulas provided in the report, is 7.5% or more.		The guideline on managing blood cholesterol identifies four major groups of people for whom moderate to high intensity treatment with statins is recommended: people who have known cardiovascular disease; those with a low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher; those aged 40-75 who have type 2 diabetes; and those aged 40-75 whose 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as estimated from the risk formulas provided in the report, is 7.5% or more. High intensity statin treatment would include regimens that in the clinical trials reviewed by the panel reduced LDL cholesterol concentrations on average by around 50% or more. Atorvastatin 40-80 mg a day would be one example of a high intensity regimen. Moderate intensity statin treatment would be regimens that lowered LDL cholesterol on average by around 30% to less than 50%. An example would be simvastatin 20-40 mg a day. The panel considered other cholesterol lowering drugs but found them to be not as effective as statins, said Neil J Stone, professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and chairman of the expert panel. Statins were chosen because their use has resulted in the greatest benefit and the lowest rates of safety issues, he said in a statement. Other drugs could be considered for patients who were intolerant of statins, he added.		The major and most controversial shift from current practice, the guideline does not recommend using combination therapy to try to reach specific LDL or non-HDL cholesterol concentration targets. Randomized controlled trials reviewed by the panel either compared fixed doses of statins with placebo or with untested controls or compared fixed doses of higher and lower intensity statins and were not designed to evaluate the effect of dose adjusted statin treatment to achieve pre-specified LDL or non-HDL cholesterol concentration targets.	COMMENTS: These new guidelines are already generating a great deal of interest and controversy. They were the subject of two above the fold articles in the New York Times. I am very interested in your comments on them. I would especially be interested in two questions:	For all, what changes in your approach and monitoring of statin treatment will result from these new guidelines?	For those physicians on statins, what changes, if any, will these result in your self-treatment?-l02jgcv7a43clh37bqctd3b156252zjwmabne

According to an article to be published in Lancet and reviewed in the New York times yesterday, the risk estimator is based on old studies and may overestimate risk based on three new studies by as much as 100%. Based on that table virtually all black males over sixty-five should be on statins. The NHBLI, which first generated the guidelines, were told about this when they circulated a draft for comment at least a year ago. Their response was to withdrawal sponsorship by stating that it was not their responsibility to issue guidelines and turned over the responsibility to ACC and AHA, whio then issued the guidelines based on the same caculator. It is not clear at this point what happens next, but this situation certainly undermines the scientic basis for the risk calculator and by implication the decisions based upon it as to whether to treat a given individual.http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/health/risk-calculator-for-cholesterol-appears-flawed.html?pagewanted=all-8q0a4oue1j

First, the initiial guideline draft including the risk caculator was developed by the NHLBi, hardly a apologist for industry. Second, the final guidelines were jointly issued by two prestigious professional associations, the American Heart Association and the American college of Cardiology. Third, the controversy is not about the value of the new guidelines. Dr. Paul M. Ridker and Nancy R. Cook, Sc.D., of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womens Hospital in their commentary published online in Lancet yesterday. stated quite clearly that they thought that the guidelines were an improvement. So what is the controversity? The risk calculator is based on studies that began 20 years ago. Three more recent studies, the Womens Health Study, the Physicians Health Study, and the Womens Health Initiative Observational Study, all show lower risks than the older studies. in Drs. Ridker and Cook's view the more recent data should have been used. In the view of the guideline committee they older studies should be used. Time will tell, but in either case the reason why they are called guidelines is because they are designed to guide, not dictate.-tz6avf8b9f1cun4a9dukzcxd581780ddia4a2a

These guidelines seem to reflect the evidence better. I am not familiar with the risk score used but that is something that needs to be adapted for each population I would suppose. The guidelines are moving still more towards individualising therapy.	Limiting the use in the older person is to be welcomed as the risk of harm from the medication (especially the common adverse effects of statins) is perhaps greater than the benefits that may come but only after nearly 10 years of use. I suppose immediately post-MI is excluded from this?	In people with diabetes we may still be using combination therapy but there is certainly no evidence for its routing use.-

Some drugs do reduce LDL values but with no evidence of effectiveness on reduced vascular events, and are expensive.This part of the guidance is sensible therefore	The emphasis on familiy history is very important.	What seems odd is the use of 7.5% as a cut point. Is it really worth treating everyone with a risk of 8% with a statin? Walnuts, Olive oil, and gentle walking would be better.-p1m

It is remarkable that an expert writing group, steeped in the dogma of cholesterol treatment targets, could dispassionately evaluate the evidence and reach a conclusion that was such a brave and wise departure from current practice. We still need to resolve how best to calculate risk and in which populations. We also need to move past the idea that patients and doctors should defer to thresholds for treatment and develop tools that will facilitate shared decisions about prevention strategies. Nevertheless, the advances in this guideline should be acknowledged. It will probably take some time before these new concepts can be fully understood and incorporated into practice. But at least in the United States the approach to preventing atherosclerotic heart disease and stroke is on a more evidence based course. Patients will be the beneficiaries when we translate these concepts into proper new practices.-s76a

Answer those two questions and you're someway toward understanding that this has nothing to do with clinical medicine; it has everything to do with commerce.	Posted by RonL	I would have to agree. The new guidelines extend the number of patients even further to get a larger proportion of the population onto statins.However, this is probably not a case driven by the improved profit to be extracted from off-patent drugs [which menas that as the price is lower more have to be sold to make the same income]. The new guidelines are driven by true believers of the faith of low cholesterol.	There is also a problem because the risk score used has been shown not to be well-calibrated against reality: i.e. it predicts an event rate twice as high as actually occurs in the population.	To be fair there is a lot of evidence that the lower LDL goes the better. From the JUPITER trial we know that if cholesterol is < 1.3 mmol/L (50mg/L), the outcome was better than in teh patients with LDL higher than that cut off. Newer agents are working towards LDL at about 0.5 mmol/L.	The real question is whether this will provide useful benefit. At current cut offs NNT to prevent an event is quite large. To go down to even lower cholesterol will make it ridiculoiusly high.	Personally, I think Risk fatigue sets in: We all have to die of something anf if we remove all other risks, it is likely to be something unpleasant that gets us in the end [famine and over-population].-8r1cz9b

For many years Harlan has pointed out the fact that statins alone among LDL-cholesterol lowering drugs reduce cardiovascular risk, and that using them should depend on the level of risk, not the level of cholesterol. When he and Rod Hayward wrote an open letter to the guideline committee two years ago inCirculation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, there were dark mutterings about undermining public confidence in medical practice. But now the same people have looked at the evidence and come up with a guideline that embodies a model based on risk, and that acknowledges that cheap generic statins have a solid evidence base that other lipid-lowering drugs lack. Harlan generously acknowledges this change of heart. Nothing is more difficult for authority figures than to change their minds in public: look at the diabetes community, still wriggling around the issue of targets in type 2 diabetes. I think Harlans commentary is not only the best written, but also the most persuasive, of all the many that have appeared in the last two weeks. Several others have been excellent, including one byIoannidis available free on the JAMA website.-6d9adc5a14bs0aj72705a84a

I think we are still missing some elements in our considerations: CRP levels for instance, not just LDL but the charged fraction of LDL and there are also issues of genetic polymorphisms to consider. There are works indicating that white blood cell counts and granolocyte counts can also affect cardiovascular disease risk. Although we know those rise in acute MI, I am not talking about those instances, but about the usual levels. Those who are more luekopenic seem to have less risk.And we did not even touch subjects like hypercoagulability states, homocysteine levels etc.	Some will say it is too complicated and one should stick to less variables. Perhaps for making crude decisions yes, but in our modern era it is time to consider all factors, since many can be easily measured and should be measured. For the individual it can mean the difference, for the whole population perhaps less.	We will be wiser in some years from now, but I cannot free myself from the feeling that in the process of finding the correct place of statins in our treatment regimens we are overtreating people with them.	It is usually the case with something the human nature considers "magical pills".	It was the case with HRT treatments, it was an still the case with osteoporosistreatment, although now we know some of the biphosphonates do not build good bone structure. It is still the case with the pill, and it was the case with COX2 inhibitors.	Those of you who are a bit more on the silver side of hair will remember the extreme happiness that attacked the world with steroids at the beginning.	We huans have a certain hubris in us. We strive to find some ultimate and simple solution to our existence and health problems. Now it is statins.	Consider some works that had a more moderate exposure than the works on statins. Those works demonstrated benefits of administration of Dunaliella Bardawil dried alga capsules on lowering LDL and had also shown benefit in downregulating genes that are involved in inflammationin our organism. One of the carotenoid isomers that is abundantly present in the alga is 9 cis beta carotene that can be involved in this process. Unlike the synthetic beta carotene used in CARET and ATBC studies, this is a naturally occuring stereoisomer which is 10 times more potens as antioxidant then the all trans isomer.Furthermore, some works have shown that 9 cis beta carotene significantly reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.	Some other works demonstrated the positive effects of other substances in food especially vegetables and fruit.	And we all know the merits of physical activity, cessation of smoking and relieving stressful situations that affect our nervous systems.	Can we forget about all these and just focus on statins as the ultimate solution? I am not convinced.-2r2f

Indeed statins should be considered at most Relatively Safe, because a 100% of statins clinical trials have been industry sponsored with its side-effects (NNH) not looked at so carefully.Statins have been described to induce, cognitive behaviour impairment, bouts of aggressiveness, arthropathy, neuropathy, myopathy, kidney disease, and who knows what else, because it has been downplayed in clinical trials.So, using it for a healthy individual for its whole life has to be well balanced in my humble opinion, specially when risk scores for that have not been yet well calibrated or replicated in populational studies, and ETC......All Best,Joey-

A teenager with a cough, fever and poor appetite,The article below appeared in the Endgames section of the BMJ a few years ago. I'll post the answer in a few days.	A 14 year old girl presented to her local hospital with a three week history of progressively worsening cough, fever, and poor appetite, which had not responded to a week of oral antibiotics.	On examination she had a temperature of 38C, was pale, not clubbed, and her oxygen saturations were 95% in air. There was a dull note on percussion, with reduced air entry on auscultation in the right upper zone of the chest, and no added sounds. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.	At admission, blood tests showed haemoglobin 109 g/L (reference range 105-135), white blood cell count 12.7106cells/L (6.0-18), neutrophils 7.65106cells/L (2.0-6.0), C reactive protein 33 mg/L (0-5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 116 mm in the first hour (10). Chest radiography and computed tomography were performed (see below). She was started on intravenous antibiotics and transferred to a tertiary centre for further management.	What abnormality do the figures show and what is the best way to manage it.-k63arb211ncz4bdba

For this a needle can be inserted under US guidance. Pus should be sent for culture and sensitivity.	As the disease has involved right upper lobe, tuberculosis should also be considered and investigated.	As the margins of abscess are clearly defined, infected hydatid cyst is another possibility.-70l

A teenager with a cough, fever and poor appetite,This shows a fluid containing cavity, walled up with solid lining. As highlighted by others, this is likely to be bacterial cavitation, ACid fast bacilli are more likely. However, one must also consider staphylococci, parasitic cyst ( hydatid cyst). Ultrasound directed aspiration and insertion of a drain can help to drain pus which can be used for diagnostic purposes. If this is hydatid cyst, then it needs a planned surgical clearance of the whole cyst without rupturing its wall-02mpr

Subscribers can see the full answer here.There is a round opacity with air fluid level in the right upper zone on the chest radiograph, which can be localised to the right upper lobe on the computed tomogram. The appearance suggests a lung abscess.Microbiological investigation of sputum, throat swab, and abscess fluid is recommended so that antibiotic treatment can be targeted. Differential diagnoses include loculated empyema, congenital cyst, hydatid cyst, saccular bronchiectasis, sequestration, and a necrotising tumour.					The treatment of lung abscess is not standardised and is based on experience. Most lung abscesses settle with conservative management, and four to six weeks of systemic broad spectrum antibiotics is the mainstay of treatment. In non-responsive patients, some centres perform percutaneous ultrasound guided aspiration or catheter drainage, whereas others favour open thoracotomy.-pl0a

Whilst it's true that such factors as malnutrition, alcoholism or poverty and overcrowding can increase the risk,infections commonly occur without any of these factors.	We currently see the causes of illness and disease as due to biological, psychological and social factors, often in combination. The relative contributions have to be assessed separately for each patient on the basis of evidence rather than onthe doctor's personal beliefs, values or evenfaith applied generallyor without detailedknowledge of the patient.-oxs8f8b7h1eybxat

Unregulated, it can lead to gross exploitation and even regulated to situations where the whole medical journey must be hedged with contracts and guided by lawyers. It seems as if a new Human Right is being established.	Human rights started with the Four Freedoms promulgated by the Allies in WW2; Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Religion, Freedom from Fear and Freedom from Want, and was expanded into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf That includes Article 16/1, "Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, natuonality or rlegion, have the right to marry and to found a family" But I think that the authors of this great document would today write "to attempt to found a family". For the routes by which a family by be obtainedare so outlandish that they test not only ethics and the law, but also respect for other humans. Poor women in poor countries, pregnant with rich children that are unrelated to them. Rich women in rich countries, pregnant at an age when when they are unlikely to see their child reach adolescence, let alone adulthood. It seems that the progress of medicine and the possibilities of medical treatment for low fertility have vastly outpaced the way that society has discussed and assimilated it. A Right to Fertility seems to have become established alongside the obvious and necessary ones of the Declaration.	Why do we not call a stop to it? An embargo on all new research, or at least the application of it while we come to terms with what we have and might have in the future. Not a chance, I fear, whilst barren couples have the fierce desire for children, the expectation of thier right to have them and in the Western World where the research is rampant, the means to enrich anyone who will offer them hope.	Ido not intend to insult my colleagues who work in infertility, especially those in the NHS who do so for no more than any other NHS doctor. But 'follow the money', and that is what is corrupting honorable and ethical work, when the dishonorable and unethical get their claws into the desperately infertile.

Even the four freedoms trumpetedby the allies after WW2havebeen fragile in the verycountries thatclaim to protect them.	One of theproblems is that one person's rights ordemands oftenconflict withsomeone else's.When that someone else is a government, even oneconsidered democratic,the government tends to overrulemany rightson the basis of economics, national security or some othercaveat that has rarelybeenconsidered or admitted when the rights were originally 'enshrined'.	I suspect that the rightto fertility similarlyfalls foul ofexclusion causes. When rights have beenbroken itis never easy to get redressbecause the policing is rarely as robust as the concept. Even where states have ridden rough-shod over human rights in the most murderous ways it tends to be decades before anyone ismade topay.	In summary, rights are necessary andacomforting thought but let'snot fool ourselves that they arealways worth the paper on which they are written, particularly,asSam Goldwyn said, when the paper on which they are written is a verbal agreement.

I agree with your further points, especially about the bill. But Evolution? Many people with or carrying unpleasant congenital diseases seem to be no less fertile than anyone else, so that recent work on pre-implanation genetic testing can be needed to prevent more children with the same problem.

Human rights started with the Four Freedoms promulgated by the Allies in WW2; Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Religion, Freedom from Fear and Freedom from Want, and was expanded into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf That includes Article 16/1, "Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, natuonality or rlegion, have the right to marry and to found a family" But I think that the authors of this great document would today write "to attempt to found a family". For the routes by which a family by be obtainedare so outlandish that they test not only ethics and the law, but also respect for other humans. Poor women in poor countries, pregnant with rich children that are unrelated to them. Rich women in rich countries, pregnant at an age when when they are unlikely to see their child reach adolescence, let alone adulthood. It seems that the progress of medicine and the possibilities of medical treatment for low fertility have vastly outpaced the way that society has discussed and assimilated it. A Right to Fertility seems to have become established alongside the obvious and necessary ones of the Declaration.	Why do we not call a stop to it? An embargo on all new research, or at least the application of it while we come to terms with what we have and might have in the future. Not a chance, I fear, whilst barren couples have the fierce desire for children, the expectation of thier right to have them and in the Western World where the research is rampant, the means to enrich anyone who will offer them hope.	Ido not intend to insult my colleagues who work in infertility, especially those in the NHS who do so for no more than any other NHS doctor. But 'follow the money', and that is what is corrupting honorable and ethical work, when the dishonorable and unethical get their claws into the desperately infertile.

Is not, in my view capable of being answered. The question most often posed in this field is, 'is there a right to a baby', or to infertility treatment, or to successful infertility treatment? The obvious answer is no, because all rights have a correlative duty, and there is no duty on any person or on the health service or on researchers to ensure that someone else has a baby. Even between married persons, there is no duty to cooperate in fertility. The marital rape exemption has been abolished, and in general the father or husband has no say in whether the mother of his child has an abortion or not. A wife cannot demand fertile intercourse; parenthood is, or should be, a matter of agreement, negotiation or at least tolerance. We know from our study of infertility treatment, there is no assurance that any one of us can ever be guaranteed by medicine a baby of our own. Is there then a right to enable everyone to access all available fertility treatment in any circumstances?		After the introduction of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law by the 1998 Act, everything is different. Broadly speaking, it elevates the rights and aspirations of the individual over legislation that was originally designed to suit largely only the public and the executive good. It permeates our written and unwritten law; it tips the scales of justice even where an older British statute had already attempted, through nuanced drafting, to balance the rights of the individual versus society. And so in the field of infertility, where the interface between individual desires and public health and ethics is particularly intimate, it has a substantial impact on the application of the infertility laws, and one that is not always expected.		Article 8 of the Human Rights convention grants the right to respect for private and family life. Article 12 grants the right to marry and found a family within national law. Article 14 declares that there should be no discrimination on any ground in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention. We should remember the historical background against which these rights were drafted (as John and others note). They were drafted in the aftermath of the Second World War and express, inter alia, the distaste for enforced sterilisation measures and prohibition of marriage between classes of persons that were features of the war and other systems of conflict and dictatorship since then. My view is that Article 12 really means that society as a whole should not prevent individuals from procreating within the legal structure of that country. This does not help us to interpret the complicated issues that can arise in relation to fertility treatment today, most of which would have been beyond the ken of the drafters.		In a civilised society there is no right to procreate at will. A regulatory system like ours maintains the basics of reproductive autonomy, for example, the right to consent and to refuse, the right to avoid reproduction as well as access to the technology as democratically distributed, and abortion. There is no free for all in the societies that we consider advanced. They regulate, for example, the age of marriage and consent to intercourse, abortion and incest.		Logically there can be no right to infertility treatment. It is too artificial a procedure to be in any way counted as a natural right or one essential to life, any more than one can have a right to good health and all possible treatment at any cost within a national health service. No patient can ever be guaranteed successful medical treatment because nature has the last word still: we can only contemplate a promise of access as determined in a democratic society without unlimited medical resources. Where the facilitating of pregnancy has to include third parties beyond the confines of husband and wife (hardly private), then accountability and medical ethics must contribute to the decision, because it has a knock-on effect for all treatments of the infertile and others.		In general, to press for a 'right' must mean that existence without that right is a blighted and uncomfortable existence. In a society where many choose to remain childless and where availability of contraception and abortion was counted in the 1960s as one of women's triumphs and, indeed, human rights, it is impossible to argue that life without a baby is a condition for which there must be a remedy at all costs. One of the difficult aspects of the HFEA was to put across the message and create the policies whereby, at one and the same time, potential patients secured reasonable access to infertility treatment (a battle with the NHS has yet to be seriously fought), while protecting childless women from the image of themselves as defective vessels needing expensive medicine to make them whole.		One particular area that has caused great concern in the UK and around the world is the rights of prisoners to have access to IVF/AI:		The cases on prisoners' rights illustrate the dilemmas posed by human rights to fertility, albeit not decided under the HFE legislation.  In 1995 Dickson was convicted of murder for kicking a drunken man to death, and sentenced to life imprisonment. While serving his sentence, he began a penpal relationship with Lorraine, who was serving time for benefit fraud and already had 3 children. They were married after her release (note that British law does not generally prevent marriage of prisoners - but does block their procreational activities). Dickson was due for release in 2009, by which time Lorraine would be over 50 and unable to conceive naturally (the court was told). The couple's application for AI was rejected; they complained to the High Court and Court of Appeal that their rights to family and private life, to marry and found a family were being denied, but they lost. The ECHR gave judgment in 2004 (Dickson v UK, ECHR 18/4/06 App.44362/04)). The European judges were clear in denying the right of a prisoner and his wife to reproductive technologies for childbearing while he was incarcerated. The argument that society allows children to be born to single parents in poor circumstances was not regarded as sufficient to entitle the prisoner to achieve something similar. This was because the state was being asked to become an active accomplice and participant in the conception. 'I believe a responsible state to be right to require of itself standards higher than those beyond its control in the free procreation market', said Judge Bonello. The court paid attention to the fact that the couple had not yet experienced normal living together and that the circumstances in which the child might be born would not be good.		To general surprise, the Grand Chamber of the European Court, consisting of 17 judges, allowed the appeal by the Dickson (albeit that by 2007 he had been moved to an open prison, was allowed home visits and Lorraine was 49) and awarded them damages for deprivation of their human rights. The Court held that Art. 8, the right to private and family life, was engaged and included respect for the decision to become parents. Prisoners retained their human rights on imprisonment and any restriction of them must be justified in each case, and not dismissed because in general they would offend public opinion. The competing interests of the state and the parties had not been properly weighed by the British authorities, said the Court, nor had the issue of proportionality of interference with the prisoners' rights, so a blanket refusal of AI amounted to a breach of Art. 8. Little attention seemed to be paid to the article of English law that was so important in the court below, and that dominates our family law, namely that the welfare of the child is paramount in decisions. The decision is odd in that it is in an area where the European Court normally respects the diverse practices and discretion of individual nations within Europe. The European Court did not invent a right to procreate; nor did it insist that conjugal visits be granted, or that reproductive facilities be granted to all citizens; it focused instead on the quality of the balancing of considerations within the policy of our government in refusing AI to prisoners. Nevertheless, the decision, inconsistent though it is, and based on a procedural argument, may be interpreted by lawyers in future cases as having originated a right to reproduce within the list of human rights.		Contrast this with the Israeli action in the case of Yigal Amir, the assassin of Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, in 1995, a killing undertaken in order to derail the then peace process. Under Israeli law prisoners are allowed to marry and have children, but in his case, because of the nature of the crime, the right to marry had been refused. Nevertheless he married, by proxy, Larissa Trimbobler, a 42 year old divorced mother of four, who shared his political views. After more than two years of petitioning for the right to consummate their marriage, she was allowed a conjugal visit in late 2006; the courts had held that prisoners have these human rights. She gave birth to a boy in 2007. Israel is a very pro-natalist country, but these actions caused some public dismay, because they amounted to nationalistic defiance as well as human rights for prisoners.		The leading case in the US is Gerber v Hickman (2002), where after some vacillation court by courts, Gerber was finally denied the right to AI for his wife. He was serving a sentence in California of 100 years for murder and his wife was 41. The court held that there was no constitutional right to procreate while in prison. Conjugal visits too were denied to lifers because there was no expectation that they would ever be reunited with their families.		Two Spanish prisoners have reportedly received IVF treatment while in prison. Fernando Garcia Jodra, 40, and his girlfriend Nerea Bengoa Zarisolo, 39, were convicted of terrorist activities associated with the Basque separatist organisation ETA in 2004. They were being held in separate prisons and denied physical contact with each other. The couple applied for fertility treatment under Spanish law, which permits women wide access to reproductive technologies. Mr Jodra, one of the gunmen convicted for the murder of former Spanish government minister Professor Ernest Lluch, was transferred to a different prison to undergo fertility treatment. The couple are reportedly being treated at the Reina Sofia Hospital in Corboda, southern Spain. The president of the Victims of Terrorism Association, Mr Angeles Pedraza, expressed anger at the news saying the treatment was 'a kick in the face for the victims'. The Spanish press report that, if the treatment is successful, the couple's child will remain with Ms Zarisolo in custody until three years old. This is not the first time Spanish prisoners have applied for fertility treatment. In 2008, a Spanish woman, Ms Elena Beloki was reportedly granted permission to access IVF while serving a 13-year prison sentence for her involvement with ETA.		The Australian Supreme Court allowed a woman in prison for fraud to continue with self-funded fertility treatment. Ms Kimberley Castles had begun IVF treatment at a clinic in Melbourne prior to her imprisonment.		In the UK the Justice Secretary launched a campaign in 2013 to stop prisoners being allowed to AI/IVF. Mr Graylings pledge indicates that he is prepared to take on the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which has previously ruled that blocking access to such treatment may breach inmates right to a private and family life. The minister has said in the past that such cases starkly illustrate the need for a change to the human rights framework. Recently he told a newspaper that he has ordered a review into the policy on prisoners having access to artificial insemination with a view to banning it. In December, it emerged that five life prisoners - four murderers and a convicted drug dealer  had asked to be allowed NHS fertility treatment so that they could father a child from behind bars. However it is feared that his proposed ban on inmates receiving fertility treatment will end up back in the courts and could see inmates who are refused treatment winning compensation.		Time will tell.		All the above reflect my own personal understanding and appreciation of relevant law and ethics. I raise these points for the purposes of discussion which (by reading others views and responses) helps me determine my own perspectives.

It's rather easy to talk about rights but, given that disputes are often settled in courts it's good for clinicians to appreciate how these things are dissected forensically. Although it's not surprising, it's still unsettling to be reminded that, like clinicians, different courts come to different judgements, some of which can seem perverse.	Dr S mentioned something in an early postthat intrigued me:	"Sometimes there are medical or even evolutionary reasons behind infertility. Should the courts be granting rights that counter evolution?"	I couldn't immediatelythink of reasons that might 'counter evolution' but I wondered if this meantgenetic disorders that woulddiminish in the population ifnot transmitted and thatthis ran counter to the popular view ofevolution as 'survival of the fittest'. I think a more current concept of genetics might refer more to adaptability in the face of adverse environments but perhaps Dr S could explain. It's interesting that the legal approaches seem to be more pragmatic and not to defer to biological concepts or belief systems.-2q2a9hoiva8n2c2a3ay3b1byk

Male family members make decisions and want male babies.				Will women essentially have to follow the orders of a man and have no choice in any regard to treatment. Will they be vessels required to carry male children? According to Amnesty International research, women in Saudi Arabia regularly require the permission of a male guardian to seek medical care including fertility treatments. Adam Coogle, a Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: There is a complex web of rules that means women are treated as minors by male guardians for the entire life.				The hospital is opening these centres because the management envisage large profits which they will use within the trust.

Many I think would see it as patronising or comical or even insulting. It could be seen as mocking some of those who have been brought up in other countries. I am even wary about adopting accents for other reasons - improving pronunciation/diction for clarity is a different matter. I also suspect adopting terms which are obviously alien to me is uncertain territory , certainly using them once an understanding has been reached would be acceptable.	Like John D , I have been exposed to much banter in the course of my life. most of my wider family are Northern folk whereas my childhood was one of Southern "smoothness" - along the lines of the Queen's English should be spoken as the Queen speaks it..... My occasional use of Northern words or vowels reflects subsequent , different geographical exposure and doubtless the incongruities cause some amusement . I would not expect a doctor to start imitating me to make me feel more relaxed - I think the effect would be very different.-i91a

Don't get me wrong, to observe it's awfully awkward, however what one needs to remember is that individuals who have learnt English in another country, or are visitors or new to the country, have learnt English with their home country's pronounciation.	As a person who lived in a European country for a number of years, it was much easier to communicate in english using that country's pronounciation of the alphabet.	Bringing back to the British Indian element, when communicating with family members coming over to visit, I cannot speak an Indian language, they speak English with a strong Indian accent. I can say a statememt or question 5 times in my standard english accent, with no effect, the second I repeat myself in a mirrored accent (note - not a humrous mocking accent, but simply mirroring their pronounciation), communication flows without problems.	Relating this to patient care, it saves time and allows for effective communication. If the person you're communicating to responds, then it's something that should be considered for normal practice. It is possible to be polite and inoffensive when mirroring accents.-ep8a

It is equally interesting that many from overseas -particularly Afro-Caribbean - speak "better" (ie clearer) English than our native born.

When I worked in Sweden, I struggled with the language ( and never succeeded) but was helped when my colleagues told me to 'sing it', to speak in a ryhthmic way.  Accent can be an important part of clarity, and a source of amusing confusion - see Officer Crabtree from " 'Ello, 'ello" and many "Goodness, gracious me" scripts - but also of an embarassing lack of understanding.	But do you think that someone speaking their native language can always mirror the accent of someone speaking it as a second language without giving offence?   This may work if the native speaker is from the same community as the second language speaker, but if they are obviously not?   I would feel embarassed if I put on a 'Indian' accent to talk to someone from the sub-continent, even if their English was heavily accented, and I think they would be offended.

As the latter is always allied with politics, and while we fear neither here, the discussion needs to as civilsed as it almost always is on D2D. Long may it do so!	My own view is that suicide is far most often associated with depression, which is or should be a temporary mental disturbance for which treatment is always availbale and usually successful.   I would not accuse our psychiatric colleagues of treatment failure, any more than a surgeon whose patient dies, but suicid as a symptom of deprssion si esenetially avoidable.	But then there are people so unfortunate as to have good reason for thinking that thier lives are not worth living.  The UK Gov has made it known that any person in this position who goes to Switzerland and Dignitas will not have their family or carers indicted for 'aiding and abetting", but ciontinues to insist that it will not make any moves towards giving 'assisted suicide' similar status to that in several US States, were its use had increased since first allowed but still helps tiny numbers of people. 	I would welcome such a law, although I know my GP colleagues have worries, epscially as the load would fall on them.

I would not see those killing themselves whilst deeply depressed as actinng "unethically", but rational suicide is a more interesting problem - and one in which there is a growing interest. Is the patient who refuses life prolonging treatment in the absence of significant depression acting unethically or simply making a balanced judgement ? There seems to be growing interest in the concept of a "completed life" : is there a time when individuals might see their lives as completed and be ready for death - increasingly relevant to some older folk but not limited to them? 	Our literature and culture also shows a respect for those who lay down life for the sake of others and one of the great religions has a suicide as a centrral theme.	I see each act of suicde as a separate event. I see somethinng unethical about it if done for frivolous or petulant reasons , tragic if part of a treatable depressive illness or readily correctable social factors , but see certain circumstances where it is an eminently rational decision. Survivors and those left behind need to be taken into account but because these may feel guilty or distressed is not necessarily a reason for the suicide not going ahead. Nor does it ,in itself, make the suicide unethical.	The original question also seems to cofuse legality and ethics : lots of things (abortion , homosexuality etc...) may be illegal at one time or place. That does not make them unethical.	An interesting additional question might be to ask whether doc2doc members would ever consider accompanying or supporting someone in going to Dignitas.....or assisting suicide should the law allow this. I am not agsinst either but see it as a very complex area.-2u0cxg8u

A visual artist must be able to see what they are trying to achieve, in paint, sculpture or film 'in their mind's eye' to a great degree, while the rest of us have that ability to varying levels of complexity.	Most doctors will have some knowledge of anatomy, and can 'see' the heart beating, the blood circulating. the diaphragm moving in respiration.  'Visualising' more complex movements is much more difficult to understand and visualise, for instance joints, all of which use a complicated combination of rotation and sliding, so that the development of replacements has been slow, aprt from the materials question.		Just closing the eyes sees nothing, blackness apart from the 'phosphenes' you see when you rub your eyes, and varying pressure fires rods and cones at random.		John-svxb3yyf

The authors initially reported a patient who had problems with imagery after a coronary angiogram. They were then contacted by 20 individuals (all men for what it's worth) who claimed they'd had a similar problem lifelong. The authors investigated these people by questionnaire and found reduced capacity for imagining. The authorsacknowledge others' scepticism but think that aphantasiamay be as real as synaesthesia and that brain functionalimaging may help to elucidate what's happening. As an aside, it seems ironicto use external imaging to investigate internal imaging!	I have never seen anyone claiming this specific disability but surely ourcapacity to imagine any real or abstract things is on a spectrum and that this can be, at least partly, a learned and learnable skill. Might there be an analogy with those who display reduced or absent emotional intelligence? My understanding is that this is the ability to imagine what effect things we do or say may have on others. Some people with autismpresumably have this problem but my understanding is that emotional intelligence is something that can be modified (up or down) with training.	I'll defer to Sidhom and others if I've got this wrong.-gv6apeyf5dm0d0c6b3a6kyfzd6eya

I tried to read a bit about the psychology of thisbut the confusing literature could make you lose the will to live.	Theunsolved argumentseems to be whether the subjective abilityto form images is the mechanism behind performing complex cognitive and motor tasks or whether these skills depend on some other underlying process that's independent of that pictorial imagery.	I find it difficult to believe that we can perform complex tasks (even hammering a nail into wood rather than our thumb) without the ability to imagine the various 'what ifs' even if theseare not pictures. Otherwise we might have to say that people who claim aphantasia should be barred from driving cars and other potentially dangerous activities.	I'm sure that people who can draw and paint have much better visual imagery than I do but that's perhaps because they see and remember more effectively in the first place.	If I'm being cynical, I suspect that you couldinvent and describeany mythicalability or disability and findplenty of people who claimed " Yes,I have exactly that"!-xy3a5b4dr6by4ara08atam4a9a

First the trial excluded people with diabetes, severely limiting its generalizability. Second, the benefits of the lower systoloc blood pressure were similar across the age ranges studied including those over sixty. This is in contrast to the general belief among physicians that the risk of lower systolic blood pressure is greater among older patients.

Posted by skenYes Sken, I think you are right, and there are also other issues to being considered.By the late 60ths the dominant view was that mild, moderate, and moderately severe hypertension should not be treated by drugs untill we knew the causes, and only malignant hypertension was treated with drugs. But there was at that time a cardiologist (not a medical teacher), who made the difference in the history of drug treatment of Hypertension: Dr. Edward D. Freis, from the VA research medical system. He conducted the first two prospective, randomised, double blind, and placebo controlled clinical trials about drug treatment of: 1: Moderately Severe Hypertension: Diastolic BPs from 115 to 129 mmHg - Excellent and Dramatically Positive Results - Published in JAMA 1967. 2: A same kind of clinical trial of mild to moderate hypertension (90 to 114 mmHg diastolic BPs: Positive results in the higher range, NIL results in the lower range. JAMA; 1970. He argued that perhaps a larger number of patients in another trial would be necessary to see a positive effect in mild hypertension. A very recent Cochrane Review of Drug Therapy of Mild, or Stage 1 Hypertension (=or< 160/100 mmHg), published in 2012, and in the opposite direction of what was said in one of the SPRINT editorials from the NEJM, found only about 7.000 patients under drug therapy to compare with those under placebo; this systematic review found No Benefits for the Drug Therapy of Mild Hypertension (PERHAPS, a Small Stroke Benefit???). Oh YES, in ALL previous RCT of Hypertension, the Significant P values have been due to drug therapy of Moderate and Severe Hypertension (>160/100 mmHg).!!!. And the best available evidence of Elderly High CV Risk Hypertensives were probably inside the UKPDS where the Strict BP Control Targets were Below 150-85 mmHg BPs. I did not finish yet studying all the material from SPRINT in NEJM, plus the supplementary data (always interesting in those big trials), and my own statistical calculations, many with raw numbers and absolute risks, compare side effects ETC...And, untill this is over I will continue following the JNC8th Report and The British/European Society of Hypertension Guidelines.One of the aspects that best distinguish the human being from the other animals is the desire of the human being for taking drugs.

Happy 2016! Coming back from Summertime Vacations. Away (as it should be) from computers and cell phones.	This was published by Dr. Edward D. Freis in Hypertension in 1974; and in my humble opinion nothing has, so far changed importantly, if that. It has everything to do with the SPRINT Trial that was a huge trial mostly in mild, at most moderate essential hypertensives."The majority of hypertensive patients fall into the borderline and mild groups. A smaller percentage of the hypertensive population falls into the groups with persistent elevations in diastolic blood pressure of 105 mm Hg or higher. However, they are a most important group because treatment has been effective in reducing their high risk of developing major complications. In mild hypertension, the physician will treat those who are at increased risk as judged by age, race, sex, target organ damage, family history, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesteremia. Even though most mild and borderline hypertensive patients are not treated, they should be followed up since some of these patients may progress to a more severestage of hypertension and should then be treated ". "The Clinical Spectrum of Essential Hypertension". Hypertension, 1974 - freely found on Google.Before I go as promissed through my own - humble - data analysis:1. Whenever a Clinical Trial is stopped early, as SPRINT, Benefits are Overinflated, Harms Dont.2. Relative Risk Reductions ARE NOT the Best way to report Clinical Benefits, because they Overinflate them. Absolute Risk Reductions are harder to achieve but are closer to reality.3. It is common practice in Hypertension trials to exclude the most "problematic" or severe patients like diabetics, and post-Stroke patients (and harder to treat = "Selection Bias") and SPRINT Did This, but later on try to incorporate them on Guidelines. Lets go now to the results that I - not them - Found:	ABSOLUTE RISK REDUCTIONS FOR THE STRICT BP CONTROL GROUP (EACH GROUP 4.600 PTS. FOLLOW-UP: MEDIAN OF 3.2 YEARS).- MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: 0.13%/YEAR.- ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME: 0.00%/YEAR.- STROKE: 0.2%/YEAR.- HEART FAILURE: 0.8%/YEAR.- CVD DEATHS: 0.6%/YEAR.- ALL CAUSE DEATHS: 1.2%/YEAR.	HARMS (THEY REPORTED AS % OF TOTAL PATIENTS): ABSOLUTE RISK INCREASE IN THE STRICT BP CONTROL GROUP.- SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 1.1%.- HYPOTENSION: 1.4%.- ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: 1.8% (NOT All AKI Injury Episodes Were Considered as Serious Adverse Events).- HYPONATRAEMIA <130 mEq/L: 1.7%.	Well you take your own conclusions, I Do Not Buy this SPRINT Trial.	I Think this is a pretty much non-realistic, aggressive, and harmful treatment for mild&moderate hypertension, and Ill stick with personalised and shared-decision-making treatment. JNC8th Goals and Targets are to me more realistic, smoother. and Do Not propose up to THREE drugs for mild&moderate hypertension as SPRINT.

I am not surprised that all thesetopics are neverexplained to the doctors at the time of their registration, who like me and the radiologist come from abroad. I had a colleauge of mine who simillar to the radiologist did not register himself to the GMC immeadetely after his arrival to the UK and the GMC became very sussicious why did not he. I think this is something that the radiologist must take into account. This is not in his plus, but he needs to explain to the GMC the reasons why delaying his registration. I understand he was busy with family and kids, but they will ask detaisl. So be prepared.I think the radiologist needs to prove that he has work permit too. If not, then he needs to find a sponsorship. I thinkthis is explained to the uk border agency website. But in all means he will need to start doing all his application procedures as soon as possible, because they may well withdrow his entitelment to work as a doctor if time passes.-1m2b1pqa27c1d

I now believe that 90% of the doctors on this forum have entered UK medical system through PLAB which is the most common path. Just to make myself and my situation more clear, I have applied for GMC registration through CESR (certificate of eligibility for entry onto the specialist register) also known as speciality equivalence. This is just another way to enter into the system as a specialist for doctors who are foreign qualified as a specialist. I am not required to give any entry exams other than IELTS but yes this involves hell of paperwork andI have already submitted piles and piles of papers (including portfolio) but somehow they always need more and more.To cut short, I am looking for someone who has entered the system through this route (CESR) or maybe some of your colleagues or friends have been through this route who can be of help.My major drawback is that till dateI am totally out of the UK system and not sure if clinical attachments will be of any help in my situation and should I go for them meanwhile registration process is going on.-yx2a9p

I am not surprised that all thesetopics are neverexplained to the doctors at the time of their registration, who like me and the radiologist come from abroad. I had a colleauge of mine who simillar to the radiologist did not register himself to the GMC immeadetely after his arrival to the UK and the GMC became very sussicious why did not he. I think this is something that the radiologist must take into account. This is not in his plus, but he needs to explain to the GMC the reasons why delaying his registration. I understand he was busy with family and kids, but they will ask detaisl. So be prepared.I think the radiologist needs to prove that he has work permit too. If not, then he needs to find a sponsorship. I thinkthis is explained to the uk border agency website. But in all means he will need to start doing all his application procedures as soon as possible, because they may well withdrow his entitelment to work as a doctor if time passes.Posted by magpieHi magpie,Thanks a lot for your post. Its good to see people posting here and I am learning a lot. Firstly I am a female Radiologist and dependant of a british citizen having full rights to work so visa is not anissue. Yes for the first 6 months I didnt had rights to work as a doctor and then had pregnancy and maternity issues. I hope these are valid reasons for delay but you never know they may or maynot accept. That is why I asked in my first post if anybody knows what are the chances that registeration will be granted ( but through CESR and not PLAB)-9v7bqa27c1d6jmi

I think it is helpful to think along the lines of the answer from Odysseus. CXR equivalents can be very useful - it can sometimes be helpful in discussion with very aggressive parents pushing for inappropriate CT scans on a child. In general I have the impression that it is the doctor who is a bit casual about irradiation - but that is in the reassessment of patients not in the A&E setting . Most x-rays requests there are usually very low dose but that does not mean one should not have good indications for the request .-huqyu

Why is everyone so worried about Xrays when there are gamma rays everywhere, even coming out of the bricks on the wall as well as radon daughters in the air (radon has no sons as its XY's die in infancy).	No one mentions alpha particles as they are under the radar screen and the press hasn't heard of them and probably thinks they are the dominant dust mites in your vacuum cleaner.	And how about those lowly beta particles or the odd neutron with ADHD going too fast or the black hole sucking the juice out of some galactic grub a few parsecs down the road.	These are all things to be concerned about. I opine we need more publicity to raise the anxiogenic potential in the lay press, not to mention The Daily Homeopath. 	Odysseus-9s6b1dn7d28b

Odysseus	Posted by Odysseus	do you think lateral decubitus film will be different and what are findings of both inspiratory and expiratory PA?	Posted by Eman Sobh	It is a given we have pus with an air-fluid interface. Both abscess and pyopneumothorax have this. We need to know is it Pneumothorax or not.	Both on lateral decubitus will show the fluid will follow gravity. We are no better off.	But inspiratory versus expiratory PA chest will show the pneumothorax is worse on expiration. If there is a very thick inflammatory pleura, this change could be less marked as the wall is stiff.	In reality, we just use CT now and even FDG-CTPET which will show a "hot" pleura and surrounding structures and probable reactive mediastinal adenopathy.	The last such case was a man with a nocardia empyema. He also has asbestos pleural thickening and plaques. PET can be very useful in these complex cases.	Odysseus-5j3b5o

The article itself does not give any measurements of dose, and so 'low-dose' CT is presumed to be a recognised entity as separate to 'normal dose' clinical CT. 	But the first reference from the paper (avaiable from the NEJMhere) does mention that the imaging parameters for 'low-dose' CT were set to give an effective dose of 1.5 mSv per scan, down from the 'normal dose' estimated at 8 mSV. The big question is whether the cancer induction risks are also reduced by 1/5, which is not really possible to determine if they are considered to be stochastic...	Weighing in at 0.015 mSv, a PA chest radiograph still packs x100 less of a dose punch than 'low-dose' CT.	What would you rather have?-2kuyirczj

My impression is that doctors are nearly always a bit embarassed by radiation risks (this is being charitable , as I think the problem is often ignorance) and request repeat studies far too often. This can happen almost irrespective of guidelines in response to patient or medical anxieties. I would also like to be convinced about slightly earlier diagnosis making a major difference to outcome. Added up some of these patients could be having very significant radiation.-

I don't think I'd like a negative PET! The full article might allow a specificity calculation.	It's interesting to dig deeper into an aspect of radiology with which I am not familiar... this topic has clearly been circulating high impact journals for a while now (since at least 1998; another Lancet article here) , yet it still hasn't reached clinical practice.

The article itself does not give any measurements of dose, and so 'low-dose' CT is presumed to be a recognised entity as separate to 'normal dose' clinical CT. 	But the first reference from the paper (avaiable from the NEJMhere) does mention that the imaging parameters for 'low-dose' CT were set to give an effective dose of 1.5 mSv per scan, down from the 'normal dose' estimated at 8 mSV. The big question is whether the cancer induction risks are also reduced by 1/5, which is not really possible to determine if they are considered to be stochastic...	Weighing in at 0.015 mSv, a PA chest radiograph still packs x100 less of a dose punch than 'low-dose' CT.	What would you rather have?	Posted by hip radiologist	To put that in perspective, living at sea level for one year gives us 2mSv. Flying to London from Australia is equal to four days radiation at sea level.	I still follow PET negative nodules for at least a year and if visible on chest radiograph I use this.	Odysseus-7c4auhrczjom

Aspirin inatctivates platelets, irreversibly, so all circulating platelets should be inactivated by a decent dose. Platelet stores will be replenished over the course of 10 days, so why not give the aspirin less frequently? It may reduce the side effect profile to give it les frequently. 	It's not my field, but I know we give 300mg initially, then 75mg thereafter. 	In my experience with bronchoscopy, patients on aspirin don't bleed, but the patients on clopidogrel do. So I'd avoid use of clopidogrel early in stroke, to reduce the risk of haemorrhargic transformation. Not the evidence you're after, John, but some grade F evidence (Non-expert opinion based on experience...)	What of dipyridamole? We don't seem to use that anymore...

Posted by neuromedicine	I am not aware of neuroprotective value of AChE-I/BChE-I in neurocognitive disorders. Currently, there are debates regarding the use of ACHE-I in Mild Cognitive Impairement (MCI). The studies that I came across used Donepezil. Ginko Biloba is probably the most widely studied of all CAMs & Herbal medicine in management of neurocognitive disorders. The results are controversial as well. In summary, AChE-I/BChE-I & NMDA antagonists are the ones that are licensed for dementia and endorsed by guidelines. MCI does not have pharmacological management for time being. Ginko Biloba is not generally main line treatment or recommended in many guidelines.	For more information, you may want to visit NICE guidelines and www.wfsbp.org-

An initial conservative counter-argument was about the risk of VaD with smoking.	However, more recent studies https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2906761/ seemed to refute this argument on basis of non-significant pooled odds ratio and affiliation with tobacco industry.-nup

Be it due to neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory process (Alzheimer's Disease 'DAT', Parkinson's Disease Dementia 'PDD', Dementia with Lewy Body 'DLB'), ischaemia (Vascular dementia VaD), or infection (HIV dementia). As the conductor leaves the orchestra, they fall into chaos and eventually music disintergrates. The end result is closely related path. Finding a cure to dementia is apparently the counter-thesis of finding a cure for cancer.	Cancer is a neoplastic process where the target is to stop cells from growth, by arresting them with cytotoxins, and blockers of angiogenesis, or removal of the newly growing cells. By contrast, dementia is a cellular degenerative process. Stopping dementia is like a micro-platform of stopping death itself. To prevent cells from death in an organ that is colloquially dubbed as non-regenerative organ as compared to RBCs or liver cells is a cumbersome task. Current treatment - though good - are quite modest tackling enzymatic defeciencies (eg AChE-I, or anti-NMDA), or at best tackling TNF (eg Etanercept which is not yet licensed). The core of dementia is not yet addressed (stopping neuronal death/ or prompting satisfactory regeneration).	Taking it to a free association talk, killing, removal, and destruction - of cells or others - has been always the aspect that humans are exceptionally good at, and hence the name 'hunter gatherer', and the Twentieth Century Medical breakthrough (Antibiotics).

The preliminary data is interesting , but some of these patients with early "dementia" seem to be functioning pretty normally and some (perhaps including responders) may have a form that progresses fairly slowly anyway. Proper trials are needed not just the re-analysis of drug firm data and anecdotes. There was a very articulate "dementia" patient on TV to-day - apparently his main impairment is in making decisions when faced with these over the phone .....	The problem is also that it may take several years to confirm real benefit and bring the drug to market. It is unlikely to be of much value on a global scale as the likely cost (as with with other biologicals) may well be considerable. There will be the usual arguments about cost saving etc... as well.	Once again it raises the interesting ethical dilemma of whether those who can afford it should be able to buy it , if the early somewhat promising reports are confirmed but there is a delay over approval. The initial costs sound pretty horrendous - and even if a fraction of the cost ultimately , it will still involve a lot of resources.	Still it sounds pretty good news and perhaps other drugs are on the way.-r26a

This could be stress caused by the patients work, relationships and home life or life events.	The neurologist needs to put on their detective hat and ask a few questions if the MS patient mentions stress. The patient may not even be diagnosed with MS (it may only be suspected) at this stage so I think it is vital neurologists are prepared for this. Also to find out how long the patient has been stressed for and to find out the severity of the stress level, such as out of 1-10. Just by asking the patient out of 1-10 how stressed are you? 10 being the most stressed.	Then to warn the patient they need to get out of that stressful situation/ environment. A bit more difficult to do if it is life events but stress management can help.	Not all MS patients and CIS patients may be aware of the link of MS and stress and that stress may trigger a relapse.-ogzse5ma42a

One is an interpetation for lay readers of the article. The other is a review, whose full text I cannot access, but which is abstracted as,"Psychological stress has been suspected to play a role in multiple sclerosis (MS) since Jean-Martin Charcot first described the disease. Moreover, patients with MS intuitively make a connection between times of high psychological stress and exacerbations of their illness. In contrast to this anecdotal evidence, a systematic review by a task force assembled by the American Academy of Neurology in 1999 concluded that "at present, the prospective data are insufficient to establish any such relationship [between psychological stress and MS] with reasonable medical certainty."	Which truncation makes me wonder if the authors were setting out to either back up, or put down the previous review. Any have access to Neurology?	Does that journal regularly include such lay reviews of the papers it publishes?MS is such an awful, disabling disease that there are many anxious patients out there , straining for hope. Is this something for the BMJ to think on, in other fields?	 JOhn-h64a9b84ca7ixeb6d

The term CAM has been changed to Stuff that works and stuff that does not, so a large number of hemi-gluteal therapies still lurk in category B. Placebos are  powerful therapies but  we should be honest about what is working.	Those who fear they have MS, or have been given a wrong diagnosis of MS  sometimes suffer far more than those with MS. People always see Jacqueline du Pr or some such shadow in a wheelchair when they think of MS. The truth is sometimes a lot kinder and easier to live with.

First, I would test for thyroid function and ask if there's any family history of thyroid disease. If the patient's blood tests come back normal , but reports a strong family history of thyroid disorders, I would begin a trial run of thyroid medication (may be causing the fatigue and digestive problems.)	Also, it's extremely important to ask the person if he's been under a lot of stress in the last three years. If so, he should be advised to maintain a healthy diet and then find himself a good yoga instructor, therapist or both - ASAP!	In the event that your patient feels better on the thyroid medication, it's probably safe to assume that you're dealing with an autoimmune reaction; in which case he must do everything possible to alleviate thestressthat triggers it.	Hope this helps.-139ad52c8c3hnc5eydwmg

Cause of death of this fit, slim 30 year old hairdresser who had already run a marathon before, is still unknown.So should we be advising patients to avoid extreme sports and marathon runnning? There have been 10 deaths during the Londonmarathon since its inception in 1981(no data on the week or so after). The last death was in 2007when a 22-year-old fitness instructor died of hyponatraemia,presumably due to overdrinking. Most fatalities are due to undiagnosed underlying heart problems (would that be conduction problems in the young?)Given the numbers running, the fatality rate is reassuringly low. I suppose the question is whether an ecg to check for conduction defect and/ or echo to look for cardiomyopathy are worthwhile before embarking on training for a marathon. The pick up rate's going to be very low but is there any down side (apart from time,money and false reassurance)? Certainly, if there's a family history of sudden death, should we suggest investigations?I've just run my first and last marathon at the age of 52. My dad dropped dead of a heart attack at 48 but I figured that if I didnt get any chest pain while training, I'd probably be ok. And I was. I didn't really consider having any checkups before.

It is a gargantuan effort and I'm sure positions you well to understand the duress the body is placed under before, during and after such trials.There are a few intersting points here. Of course, the marvellous case of Fabrice Muamba highlights the stark contrast in possible outcomes. Tragic or miraculous, these are sensational stories for the media that distort the reality of the risks involved - expert, politically unmotivated and media-free opinion can be the only guide here...But does knowing actually help? Are we able to predict those at risk accurately enough to avoid the psychologically and physically detrimental effects of knowing that if you push it too hard, you could die?When I was at school, there was a boy in my house called Richard van Rossum who knew he had a deadly cardiac arrhythmia. He had an internal defibrillator/pacing device. He was a marvellous guy, full of spirit, and very active. He played many sports and did so well. And with all that, he collapsed and died running to a History lesson. It was a huge shock, especially considering the circumstances, but something he and his family understood could happen. His father, an Olympic hurdler, continued to coach at the school for a few years after his death, which was such a typically selfless gesture of the family and was hugely appreciated.What can you do?-my0bu0bqb6cyb8d9f3h

Common pathway in all these conditions isventricular                                  fibrillation (VF) as the main  presenting rhythm in SCA.24 In the under-16-year-old age group, commotio cordis (cardiac contusion) is thought to be responsible for up to 20% of SCAs.                                  It is very uncommon after 21 years of age.25 26. Other cardiac causes of SCA  include myocarditis, ruptured aortic aneurysm, aortic valve                                  stenosis, mitral valve prolapse,  dilated cardiomyopathy, drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias and the  ion-channelopathies29  which include the long and short QT syndrome (caused by sodium or  potassium ion channel genetic mutations), Brugada syndrome                                  (defective sodium channel gene) and  familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia30 (abnormal ryanodine receptor regulating calcium release). Non-cardiac causes of SCA include asthma, heat stroke, cerebral                                  artery rupture and exertional rhabdomyolysis secondary to sickle cell trait. via Karim Khan,MBBS,PhD - editor, BJSM-ld1ce62aib2e24daaaaaaaaaaaaapf352227l2a

In their study, the authors asked participants in the 2010 Bonn Marathon/Half-Marathon about their use of medication and any symptoms they had during and/or after the race.Runners who popped painkillers were five times as likely to experience symptoms as those who didnt take these drugs; the overall difference in risk was 13%. Withdrawal from competition because of gastrointestinal problems was significantly more common among those taking painkillers and other symptoms included stomach cramps, cardiovascular problems, gastrointestinal bleeds, blood in the urine and joint and muscle pain.The rate of symptoms rose in parallel with increasing dose. One in 10 of those taking diclofenac took over 100 mg; 43% of those who took ibuprofen, the second most popular choice, took doses of 800 mg or moretwice the recommended dose. Nine runners who took painkillers said they had ended up in hospital: three for temporary kidney failure after taking ibuprofen; four for bleeding ulcers (aspirin), and two after a heart attack (aspirin), one of whom had taken 500 mg for mild foot pain.http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/4/e002090.full-5y2b31blf2jr07725bpvfa

Cause of death of this fit, slim 30 year old hairdresser who had already run a marathon before, is still unknown. So should we be advising patients to avoid extreme sports and marathon runnning? There have been 10 deaths during the Londonmarathon since its inception in 1981(no data on the week or so after). The last death was in 2007when a 22-year-old fitness instructor died of hyponatraemia,presumably due to overdrinking. Most fatalities are due to undiagnosed underlying heart problems (would that be conduction problems in the young?) Given the numbers running, the fatality rate is reassuringly low. I suppose the question is whether an ecg to check for conduction defect and/ or echo to look for cardiomyopathy are worthwhile before embarking on training for a marathon. The pick up rate's going to be very low but is there any down side (apart from time,money and false reassurance)? Certainly, if there's a family history of sudden death, should we suggest investigations? I've just run my first and last marathon at the age of 52. My dad dropped dead of a heart attack at 48 but I figured that if I didnt get any chest pain while training, I'd probably be ok. And I was.  I didn't really consider having any checkups before.

Sounds a goldmine for private health care! And why stop at marathons - triathlons , some fairly standard group cycle rides and a whole range of other activities (mountain hiking) seem just as much "risk" factors. The number of deaths during these is likely to be smaller because of numbers and less newsworthy anyway . Let's have some clearer evidence that these checks would be of value and outweigh the drawbacks of raising anxiety levels etc... A history of sudden death in the family , possible angina etc... are indications for investigation anyway and there may be a place for testing for those planning a serious career in competitive sport , but not for those participating in what is after all , for many of those involved , not much more than jogging a few miles. The idea that doctors really feel routine tests on the thousands of folk is time well spent is pretty staggering - at least in the absence of good evidence of benefit.-ix1a9b

Then there is a group of "celebrities", often famous for being famous, but I haven't seen a Kardashian in a marathon, more likely the celebities are doing it for charidee, like an awful lot of amateur runners, or else like mklst other marathoners, doing it as a personal challenge.	Just because you don't like running...	To an extent you are right.  To take regular part in some non-work related activity, one must have some time available and disposable income.   Don't take my opinion; read Vincent Saravello on "Class and Gender in Recreational Marathon Running":https://www.jstor.org/stable/41674939?seq=25#page_scan_tab_contents  He shows that there is a bias in marathon participants; they tend to be male, with professional or managerial occupations and secondary or tertiary educattion.

For the latest London Mararathon, they found that:Running smart comes with ageFurther investigation shows that Strava members in the 40-49 age group show their experience and run a faster race than their younger contemporaries. They finish with an average time of 3:43:14, in contrast to the younger 20-29 age group, who clock up 3:44:47.Keep up the paceThe average overall recorded pace on Strava during the 2014 London Marathon was 9:24/mile, with men averaging 8:49/mile and women 10:06/mile. Patterns show the excitement that builds at the start of the event, with the first four miles being the fastest at an average pace of just over 8:00/mile.Finish timesBased on the uploads, the average marathon finish time of a runner on Strava is 4:06:08. The difference between mens and womens average overall times is 34 minutes, with men crossing the finish line at 3:50:59 and 4:24:27 for women.http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/events/the-stats-of-london-marathon/13153.html	The first stat is the most interesting IMHO.

It seems that (and I am not belittling what must be seen as achievement for some) that just completing the distance is the more accurate description. Do we need to specify whether this is by walking , jogging or wheelchair etc...? There used to be a range of standards for running marathons (depending on the course) eg national , regional etc... : have these altered much over the years and how do the different age groups compare ?-

Nor do they deny risk factors for driving etc...(although some do just this). I suspect many of those who run marathons now only do 1/2 marathons anyway. Any exercise will have risks for some folk - the big problem with major marathons is that it is a lot harder for folk to quit when they should particularly if doing it in the name of some charity or other.	I seem to remember as students there was a large scale event for London hospital students whereby we went from London to Brighton (just under 50 miles) . Some of us ran this , others walked. So far as I know the only real problems were due to traffic and the event was eventually stopped.	Just whether encouraging many folk to run outweighs the risks for the few has not , I think , been adequately investigated. Similarly it would be very interesting to know comparisons with other popular endurance types of events - the annual cross-country skiing in Switzerland or the round the towns ice skating in Holland or some of the long distance cycling "challenges". One might expect health problems with some of the serious endurance events (eg marathon du sables , Death Valley runs). My impression has been that our London marathon is unhealthy in what it has become but running in itself is not bad for your health and covering 26 miles no great deal for the appropriate individual. Making it too competitive for those not up to this type of competition is the disaster.-nl4b

Prof Sanjay Sharma, a cardiologist at St Georges and the London Marathon's medical director has pointed out that sudden death in those who take exercise is very rare, 1:50,000, and that in the entire history of the London Marathon there have been just 14 deaths. As this year's event saw the one millionth runner cross the finishing line, those two figures match well.	But what is the morbiidity of the LM?  THis article deals with1981-2003:http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/london-marathon-what-we-know-about-the-incidence-of-injury-illness-and-death-in-the-london-marathon-881#	Ignoring those who 'merely' consulted the St.Johns Ambulance members in attendance, in 1981 eleven of 6418 runners were 'seen in hospital', 0.17%.  At that first Marathon, I think that most runners would have been well experienced and fit endurance runners.  But lo!  In 2003, 32,300 people took part and 58 people went to hospital. 0.18%!!!!!  So the carnard of poorly prepared runners pushing themselves beyond sensible levels is that, an unfounded rumour.	I'll leave someone else to go through all the years and work out the proportion who needed, or were deemed to need to be seen in A&E, and I'll leave the author, Dr.Dan Tunstall-Pedo to summarise:	Over 23 years, the risks were:		contact with St John: 1 in 6;		contact with a hospital accident and emergency department: 1 in 800;		hospital admission: 1 in 10,000;		death: 1 in 67,414  a risk which is comparable to many daily activities.	I don't think this level of morbidity is commensurate with a Marathon being bad for your health.	John-9q9bbb6gtimetb8a7xb4ij0el529802ljpha

Practitioners claim that subjecting certain parts of the body to magnetostatic fields produced by permanent magnets has beneficial health effects.These pseudoscientific physical and biological claims are unproven and no effects on health or healing have been established.Although haemoglobin is weakly diamagnetic when oxygenated and paramagnetic when deoxygenated, the magnets used in magnetic therapy are too weak to have any measurable effect on blood flowClaimed benefit :-Greater resistance to infectionIt helps to remove waste products from the blood ie lactic acid calcium and cholesterolIt increases energy and strengthIt helps recovery or can prevent onset of R.S.I. (Repetitive Stress Injury)/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. It alleviates migraine and headaches. There is still much research and debate about magnets work.

Science helped us to realise later that those herbs contain various active chemical substances and we learned how to manufacture those in labs and medications appeared with dosages, etc.If we think along similar lines, let us suppose that the healer using a certain magnet is actuallly like the healer who prepared potions from leaves. The healer has no idea what exactly works, but for some reason it helps certain patients. Now let us take a little dive into the subatomic world of modern quantum physics with the theories of certain energy fields at work, of matter being actually also waves, string theory and membrane theory etc, about the true nature of our reality , and let us suppose that some action actually does something on that level, altering the matter-wave in a certain way as to "tune" it differently, and perhaps there is your effect on subatomic level, creating a change on atomic- molecular level.But we simply don't know yet how to manage it, how to achieve the desired effect..Perhaps in the future we will learn how to elicit certain effects that will lead to improvement or cure on those complicated levels.Just as we learned to make the chemical substance from the leaves. Only now we are on the "leaves" level with magnetotherapy and other alternative therapies.And perhaps all these really don't work and what we witness is placebo effect. But then how far can we actually boost up a placebo effect?-

Ashutosh,Re: Magnet Therapy, Does it work?,Magnetic treatment is of two kinds, local and general, depending on whether          the disease is localized or all-inclusive. The palms or the soles of the          feet are placed on two magnets with different poles and the patient is          exposed to them for 10 minutes a day, preferably in the morning before          breakfast. Chronic cases take half-an-hour a day. The precautions are          cursory: no ingestion of anything cold an hour after treatment, no bathing          for two hours after. Strong magnets should not be applied to pregnant          women and to the heart and the brain.One of the reasons for magnet therapy's growing popularity is that there is          no paucity of therapists and teachers.A magnet can also be used without looking like an awkward prosthesisa          hearing aid, or worse still, a crutch. You can go jogging wearing a magnetic          headband ("improve your memory on the run"); you can grace parties wearing          magnetic necklaces made of silver and gunmetal in India, and gold in Australiathese          chokers treat bronchitis and protect against an asthmatic attack. Magnetic          earrings and pendants guard against an under-active thyroid. Magnetic          goggles are handsome add-ons that double as cures for conjunctivitis and          glaucoma, and help reduce visual defects. If you are a pretty spinster          and insistent suitors are raising your BP, a magnetic ring will work like          magic-ridding you of both. And magnets as gifts allow you to be idiosyncratic          without being over-the-top. There is, of course, a catch to magnet therapy: outside of orthopedics,          it is an unpredictable, sporadic success. It is still a system of the          last resort: its patients are most often refugees from other therapies. Often chronic cases come to us after having          tried all other systems and expect quick relief. What is also missing is rigor and research. Practitioners lack a scientific system of analysis. We don't document          our cases, which is absolutely necessary for research. So what is missing from this therapy is not magnetic appeal but the kind          of scientific zealotry that attracts both funding and practitioners. For          only then will it succeed in breaking the stranglehold of modern pill          popping and needle-jabbing medicine.-vk068moha

I bought a couple of bracelets because I liked the looks and design and figured it couldnt hurt.Shortly after, I began feeling better. Istopped the meds that they were giving me and didn't have problems with stress or anxiety like I was having. I am not saying that it stopped instantaniously. I still had problems, but they were greatly reduced. I started purchasing other magnetic products, such as a magnetic knee brace. It was a total life saver.

Good for them and shame on us atheists!Medecins Sans Frontiers arean irreligious medical outfit, but their ethos is to go where the strife is worst and the risk is greatest, and they demand langauges AND experience in the provison of Third World aid. Too much for a soon-to-be retiring doctor, like me and you, Drs.Doc and Valenta!I have volunteered for the 2012 Olympics! The main effort has been to recruit 'ordinary' people to work for the Games, and thewindow in which volunteers could put themselves forward has now closed, but I'm sure that the Games organisers will be glad to hear from doctors who want help.See: http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/london-2012-games-makers/index.php But don't expect to get a front row seat at the 100m final!Lastly, and in following my own interest, would you like to become a Motorsport doctor? I'd be glad to talk to any doctor who is interested in getting closer to the action at rallies, circuit racing and other forms of motorsport. You do get paid, though not much!John-5x1b2e7kncyk6h3faa2g7ga6l

There is one doctor one nurse a physiotherapist and a social worker. We often take volunteerhealth professionalsand have hada UK based GP work with us in the recent past.

Also three others were reported died the same day!Everest was first summitted 59 years ago by Edmund Hillary and  Tenzing Norgay, who reached the top on the morning of May 29, 1953. The  pair are believed to have been the first people to do so. Since then, approximately 3,000 people have attempted the feat and  more than 200 have died trying. However, due to the difficulties posed  by recovery, a dangerous and expensive endeavour, the bodies of many remain on the mountainside.-

Bottles and crap litter the place. Also wasn't the lack of o2 implicated in the 96 disaster with those trying to get up the hillary step pushing as they were running out of oxygen and wanted to summit before it ran out and those who had summited fighting to get down as they were now nearly out? Bourkereev managed to rescue those he did as bottled oxygen wasn't his limiting factor.Also if O2 puts the ppO2 at 1000m lower then it isn't an 8000m peak anyway.This would also have the effect of dramatically limiting the number of people on the hill, making it an elite target for elite athletes, not those who can pay to be dragged up with a Sherpa carrying an ICU ward.-

Have you tried zooming into that original? It's likedivingdown on Google Earth, but in more detail. JohnPosted by John DAgreed respected John! But here is an important tip from the basic physics- How to look at the photographs' Every photograph is, however black and white it may be, is 3-D in nature. But our human eyes being stereoscopic, are not able to see the inbuilt depth, the third dimension in it. The reason why the birds can fly with ease is that they lack the stereoscopic vision and have 'monoscopic' vision. If the birds would have a stereoscopic vision, they might not be able to fly, due to perception of the depth. To unmask the hidden depth or the third dimension in the photographs (actually 3D images), simply close one eye, so that the apparent two dimensional image would then appear a 3-D image! Look at the upscaled image by me with one eye closed and you will be aware of the depth, the third dimension and the beauty.-pz2axbaakg

I am the only one who knows the whole story."		JS Mill quote: "Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."		The responsibility of making all the decisions and the liability for the outcomes of those decisions is worrying for doctors.		This is about competent patients.		If you agree with your rights as an individual you will agree with this motion.		Through initiatives like open access and Patients Included patients can now work with a lot of the same information/data that researchers and specialists do.		The patient as a network of care givers and other advocates in the community is in a better position than one doctor ever could be.		To keep on top of all the primary care literature a GP would have to spend 18 hours a day reading.		A doctor sees a patient for 1-2 hours a year. The patients and care givers self care for the other 8764 hours.		Patients are the ones who know how to live well with their diseases; they are able to prioritise the outcomes that matter to them; they are the ones who know how to make decisions in time frames appropriate to them.		The imbalance between doctor and patient is changing.		Co-production is an opportunity to work with patients in order to develop things in a new way.		From patients we can learn about things that clinicians never reailsed were important.		Biomed central has just produced the first journal based entirely around co-production with professional and patient coordinators.		Don't think of patients as a burden, think of them as a resource we need to harness.		It is the ageing population and people with diabetes, cancer, mental health that come to mind when thinking about this motion.		Doctors do not just provide healthcare, they manage healthcare which is a long term process where the patient can be brought in to know best.		Well informed patients with capacity who are stakeholders of their own health would not make decisions that would impact negatively.		Richard smith, ex-editor ofThe BMJ,is chairman of Patients Know Best.		Why not recruit patients onto your team? By empowering them you can work together for better results that cannot be achieved alone.		Self care is already part of many plans - eg diabetes. Why not increase this?Against		No one person knows best, it is about balance.		Patients know "different" but not "best".		The current power and knowledge imbalance prevents patients from knowing best.		Patients seek listening, understanding, and caring, not a win-lose "I know best."		There is no published literature saying the patient view is the singular correct one.		Being informed is not the same as being responsible; patients and families should not be in the position of being entirely responsible for their care. Shared decision making is the better way.		Don Berwick's "My right knee" speech is about the impact of recurrent patellar dislocation, multiple cartilage tears/repairs, and subsequent osteoarthritis on his trekking, his playing with his children, and his keeping fit.		Patients know what is important to them but may not know everything.		Science in medicine is complex. Think Dr House - the wonderful brain that instantly recognises the 24 causes of erythema nodosum, or the rare complication of the over the counter cold remedy that leads to brain inflammation and death. We can't expect every patient to have this level or range of knowledge. If we did. we wouldn't be necessary.		This is not limited to medicine. Do you really understand the heating engineer when he tells you that you need a new boiler?		When patients are ill they want relationships with their doctors.		Doctors know more about the side effects of drugs than patients; patients know more about which side effects they don't want. Eg a swimmer doesn't want weight gain		If rushed to hospital in an ambulance, "Don't ask me what's best, just save my bloody life."		In general, patients are excluded from knowing everything.		Patients don't want to know what is best, they want to work with doctors for what is best.		Identifying anyone as knowing best is counterproductive to working as a team.		Giving too much power to one person sets up rivalry.		Look at the example of Ashya King. Irrespective of which side you think is right, there should have been a push to harmonising the views between healthcare professionals and the patient/parents to look at all perspectives/scenarios and calculate what was best for the patient.		Don't vilify one side for not knowing best.		The external social factors that patients bring are important but they are not the only matter of importance.		Currently there is miscommunication and patients have a lack of working knowledge of systems so healthcare opinion is necessary.-gf4k2a27sia65bk4biza

Clealy some of this is a generational thing with the new thrust of care towards groups and populations not individuals. Does the patient know best ? Some do , some don't . Do doctors know best ? Some do , some don't - but all are encouraged to follow policies which may well not be in the best interests (as perceived by the patient ) of the individual concerned. Many of those points raised in the "Against" column suggestion that we really have moved back to a time of justifying paternalism not far removed from 50 years ago - it is just a different type of paternalism and more dangerous for being pseudo-scientific based on asking the wrong questions....-

In the way its asked the question is surely unanswerable. The words angels, dancing and heads of pins come to mind. I can see that the question might be one for a student debate but does it really justify the time and expense of an international event which doesnt seem likely to lead to anything tangible.	I cant help wondering if theres a hidden hand behind all this. These conferences cost a great deal of money and I just wonder where it comes from. The Institute for Healthcare Improvements website is a little vague on its sources of funding. Could all that money not be betterspent onother things? If the answer to the ill-defined question was yes I suppose, however,it could have dramatic implications (in either direction) for funding the Health Service!	COI: Ive read the opposing arguments above but couldnt justify spending the time watching the debate.-f80auc5p4cxe9ain4e2e970482bcha7ewkybza4nugyezb

Almost certainly not, hence they consult a Doctor. Would it not be essentially obvious that the Doctor and patient cooperate together to try and do what is best for the patient. A patient might be thoroughly unrealistic about treatment, its chances of success or what they believe treatment should be. The Doctor is the expert in medicine and the patient the expert about themself - together they have the best chance of overcoming whatever health problem they face.	kirked-9qq2c7dtg

I suppose it's no accident that the wording is aligned with the name ofparticular organisation linked to a previous BMJ editor. Whilst there's no inherent problem with this, the forumwas a vast event with the backing of some very large corporations and there must surely be a larger agenda than simplyto debate such a gnomic question.

It is in the nature of a formal debate that the terms of the argument are put starkly. This facilitates rapid exploration of the issues, in order to help the listeners reflect on their own attitudes/prejudices. In fact the feedback from the audience was very positive, and the swing was genuinely marked. For the first time this year, the Forum had recruited a patient panel to help us frame the agenda and ensure proper patient representation. Again this was well-received, and patient inclusion will only deepen in future.As for IHI: it is a not-for-profit that does superlative work, improving healthcare in many different countries. It reaches millions of professionals, and its model is that the fees it receives from health systems in the developed world, pay for the work it does in low-income countries. Many of its resources, such as its Open School, are completely free. The Forum, now in its 20th year, does not cost IHI anything. There is no 'hidden hand', whatever that is supposed to mean; most of the delegates pay to attend, and the costs are also met by the sponsors, all of whom are publicly acknowledged, and the most generous of which is the Health Foundation.-

As a former mental health service user and patient and public engagement practitioner, I was miffed at first that I was on the 'opposing' team.

During the debate - and for those who have criticised it, but not watched it, I would urge you to check it out - both sides developed nuanced arguments that could serve for deeper discussion.	Such a formal debate is not a subsititute for further dialogue (NB it was an experiment for IHI/BMJ) that would model the sort of shared discussions and decision making we truly need to advance healthcare.

Yet I have long had a misgiving that we do not look long and hard at its complications. Essentially the problem is that once the patient "comes round" there is inadequate follow-up. Some examples from my own experience or those I know about - effect of drop in blood pressure (not necessarily an absolute drop but one related to individual) , post operative renal problems , possible exacerbation of poor cerebral functioning in the elderly , symptoms associated with spinal cord damage after spinal etc.... None of these would necessarily be relayed back to the anaesthetists concerned who may blithely conclude all is well.	Years ago as an acute physician we ised to admit a number of post -operative surgical problems but the surgeon running the surgical audit did not want to know with a singularly unhelpful response along the lines of what about the problems caused by the physicians.-fnz

My earlier comment was that because we now assume the anaesthetic risks and complications are minimal ("patients are at their safest when anaesthetised") and we really need better data about what are the longer term effects - it should be quite possible to do a large scale audit of the CEPOD type but geared towards the anaesthetic.

One that is at the front of every anaesthetist's mind is the airway, and today that task has been made much easier by the several Supra-Glottic Airway (SGA) devices that are available.   To anticipate any problems, there are clinical scoring systems, that can indicate potentially difficult airways and intubations, but this case totally slipped by them.	The patient was to have procedure for which an SGA was appropriate, and scored normally on all indicators of airway difficulty.   But an i-gel SGA could not be positioned, nor could a Laryngeal Mask Airway (for non-anaesthetists, SGAs are normally passed blind).  So we had a look into the patient's pharynx, and this is what we saw.

But back to the problem, which was that the anatomy of this patient's pharynx would not allow a supraglottic airway to be positioned, and obscured the larynx on direct larygoscopy, so that intubation was difficult/impossible.  Solutions would include:	Abandon the procedure.  Maintain the airway by hand, and allow the patient to awake.  This is the safest by far and should be considered before any other.	Proceed using oral (Guedel) or nasal airways.  Possible, even with a full stomach, if cricoid pressure can be maintained and the urgency justifies.	Use a modified laryngoscope blade that allows you to 'see around the corner'. EG the "Airtraq" disposable with a system of mirrors or the re-usable McCoy blade with a liftable tip.	Use videolaryngoscopy.  Technology has now advanced tio the point where a laryngoscope blade can have high resolution camera built into the tip.  The image may be shown on a screen attached to the 'scope (EG McGrath), or be separately mounted (Glidescope).	My department had elected to buy a Glidescope, and with its aid I had a clear viw of the vocal cords and was able to pass an endotracheal tube, shaped by a wire bougie, quickly and with ease. 	Every theatre suite should have a videolaryngoscope, and of course have the anaesthetic and technical staff trained in its use.  I've mentioned several makes, really to indicate the wide range available - you should make your own choice.	John-4i3bb4c8cwgb5p2eb5jb91ateb

I haver had the same panic as the other trainees about this occurance - I simpy reached for the bronchoscope, intubated the trachea with the 'scope, and railroaded the tube over the 'scope. 	But, certainly there's a panic that sets in when one has paralysed the patient, and the view down the laryngoscopescope is a grade IV.	I think our anaesthetists do a lot more awake "fiberoptic" (actually a flexible camera) intubations these days, by determining who will have a difficult airway pre-hoc.-rhqzl

Yes, there are many other options than I spelt out above.  Anaesthetists today are trained in many ways, with several technologies, to achieve and maintain the airway.	When I last did a Paeds Trauma Life Support course, I was the oldest candidate, and the only consultant.   In moulage (acted out scenarios) they repeatedly threw severe airway problems at me, "Can't intubate, can't ventilate" so that transtracheal insufflation was the only option. On a neonate.  I am deeply thankful that that has never happened for me in reality, in an adult, let alone a baby, but glad I've been through it in practice. It really made me sweat!https://vimeo.com/32877016	John-4gsb4plbbb9ooab7l

Which means that it is hard to incapacitate someone with N2O alone. Used to done, but by partioaly asphyxiating the poor patient. Tere have been stories since the 19th Century of burglars and others subding people with chloroform, but that would need a soaked pad held to the face, and while Chloroform is quite potent, they victim would need to be bound and gagged, or kept under with the chloroform.	An anaesthetic that could subdue someone who neither cooperates nor knows that they are being subdued is a long sought target by security services. Whena Chechen seperatistsheld hostagea Moscow theatre full of people in 2002, the Russians pumped a nebulised form of fentanyl into the air conditioning system. It was unsuccesful in subduing the terrorists, but zapped many the hostages. In the ensuing gun battle most of the terrorist were killed. Of the 850 hostages, 130 died, only one from gunshot wounds, the rest narcotised to death, largely because the Russian authorities did not tell the many doctors and paramedcs standing by that they had used a narcotic. Simple antagonists like naloxone could have saved many, who were thought to have had infarcts or other problems. Many probably asphysiated from loss of airway becoming unconcious sitting in a theatre seat.	No, I don't think that there is any 'gas', available to a lorry robber, that could temporarily incapacitate the driver without high risk of permanent injury.

At the time of the Angiogram she was 52. Her past medical history included heart burn, indigestion, ME, and IBS. In the past she has had episodes of depression, has complained of panic attacks and has long been anxious about her health. She has, in common with many, exhibited a dislike of medical procedures. On 14 April 2009, Mrs C complained to her GP of symptoms that were consistent with, or suggestive of, angina pectoris. As a consequence, she was referred to hospital where she attended for investigation on 28 April 2009. Following that consultation, Dr S of the hospital staff wrote to her GP:		"- chest pain history - considered to be suggestive of angina  Occurred on exercise, relieved by rest ... Risk factors for heart disease- patient stop smoking started 1970 stopped 2000 smoked on average 20 per day no history of strokes ... Examination heart sounds normal Apex beat, JVP normal. Carotid pulse was normal. The following heart murmurs were present: ESM Grade: 3 Respiratory system: normal. Investigations- ECG. Clinical diagnosis of possible angina . Patient referred for echocardiogram  Typical chest pain, ex smoker, systolic murmur at the base of the heart. Echo and ETT arranged as urgent."		An echocardiogram was performed on Mrs C on 25 May 2009, reported as normal. On 3 June 2009, Mrs C performed an exercise test following which Dr G of the hospital recommended that an angiogram be performed on Mrs C. Dr G provided Mrs C with a consent form preparatory to performance of the angiogram. In addition, Mrs C was sent an information sheet that explained the procedure in detail, and described risks involved with the procedure. In particular, the information sheet stated that:	" As all blood vessels are connected to the heart, gently passing the catheters through the arteries and veins carries them painlessly into the heart  In skilled and experienced hands problems are uncommon. Nevertheless, there is a small risk that a badly narrowed artery will block during the test. This can cause a myocardial infarction (heart attack) which can have serious consequences. This is more a risk of the disease rather than the technique "		Mrs C duly signed the consent form and, on 19 June 2009, attended the catheter laboratory.		The timing and sequence of events in the course of Mrs C's angiogram was not fully recorded as the equipment used does not automatically record what is visible during the procedure. However, the operator may record sequences of moving pictures of interest, in the course of the procedure and on a CD of Mrs C's angiogram, 48 sequences of moving pictures showing the procedure at different times are recorded. In Mrs C's case the procedure commenced at about 11.00 a.m. when a local anaesthetic was given and an incision was made in her right arm to permit access for a catheter via her radial artery. Soon after the insertion of the catheter Mrs C began to suffer from spasm and pain in her right arm so the catheter was withdrawn. Another attempt to perform the angiogram via the radial approach was unsuccessful and therefore some minutes later, Dr M abandoned that approach and decided to attempt access via the femoral artery. Mrs C was given a local anaesthetic in her leg and at about 11.30 a.m and a catheter inserted via the femoral artery.	During the procedure staff monitored Mrs C's blood pressure and ECG. At the commencement of the procedure the ECG record had been calibrated to zero and a baseline ECG was undertaken. The ECG was continuously monitored but it was not continuously recorded.		The prescription record shows 3 mg of morphine and 1.25 mg of diazepam at 11.20 a.m. It shows that between 11.20 a.m. and 11.50 a.m. a further 3 mg of morphine and 2.25 mg of diazepam was dispensed. In the course of the procedure Mrs C complained of pain in her right arm and of severe pain across her back, chest and jaw. It is agreed that she complained of pain in the right arm as soon as the spasm developed in her right arm; when she first complained of the other symptoms of pain is a central issue in this case. At an early stage in the course of the procedure Dr M saw from images obtained of Mrs C's heart that her left descending artery was occluded. This is a serious and potentially life threatening condition as that artery serves about 40% of the muscle of the heart. The detection of that condition turned the procedure being performed on Mrs C from an angiogram to an angioplasty. In Mrs C's case the identified occlusion was cleared by insertion of a balloon and then two stents into the arterial system of her heart, the stents being employed at about 12.30 p.m. when it first became visible on X-ray that there had been a dissection of the left main stem artery. Whether that occurred shortly after the angiogram procedure was begun via the radial route or only after the femoral route was begun is another important issue in this action.		At some time after Dr M determined that the LAD was occluded he called for the attendance of Dr B, the supervising cardiologist who probably arrived at or about the time when the femoral catheter was inserted. In consequence of the dissection, on 19 June 2009, Mrs C was transferred to another hospital. On 29 June 2009, at that hospital two further stents were inserted into Mrs C's arterial system. She was discharged on 6 July 2009.'		'When giving evidence Mrs C said that after the procedure began she felt an severe pain in her right arm of which she complained to the medical staff. She said that she heard the doctor , Dr M say "is she 32 or 52?" and she said, "I'm 52, ..why does this matter?" to which Dr M replied that younger women usually go into spasm if it is put in the arm. He then said, "We'll go in her leg instead" to which Mrs C said "I don't want you to" to which Dr M answered, "It won't take long as we've put it in your leg now." Mrs C said that she was confused and afraid and that she had lost confidence in the ability of the staff to carry out the procedure painlessly and repeatedly said, "I need this to stop now." Dr M said, "I've seen one side and the artery's clear and looks good, I just need to get round the other side. It shouldn't take a minute." Mrs C said, "I don't want you to, I need this to stop now. 'I then experienced the most excruciating pain of my life across my back and my chest and my jaw." She said in her evidence before me that in the course of the procedure he was calm, reassuring, sought to put her at her ease and seemed "fine in his attitude."		Mrs C'a case was that Dr M should have abandoned the procedure after she complained of pain in her right arm that was consistent with spasm. She told him at that stage that she wanted it to stop and if he had done so she would not subsequently have agreed to it being continued, whatever the doctor had said to her, and the dissection would not therefore have occurred. She withdrew her consent for the procedure to continue before access was attempted via the femoral route and that she did not complain of "excruciating" pain until after access to her arterial system had been gained by the femoral route'.			The crux of Mrs C's case was that:		1. She did not provide valid consent for the angiogram as she was provided with misleading information before the commencement of the procedure.		2. Secondly, that she withdrew such consent as she had given before access via the femoral route was undertaken and it was only after this time that she sustained a dissection of the LAD.		The defendant hospital maintained that:		1. It did not provide misleading information overall. Even if it was misleading, they claimed, it did not vitiate her consent. They do not admit consent was withdrawn during the procedure.		2. They assert that at the material time, Mrs C did not have capacity to withdraw consent and therefore any apparent withdrawal of consent was not valid. Mrs C asserts, however, that at the time she withdrew consent she was fully conscious and aware of events such that she could withdraw her consent. In particular she says the medication she received would not have been sufficient to have affected her capacity. The Defendant also asserts that an event that threatened Mrs C's life occurred before withdrawal of her consent such that the staff of the hospital were entitled to ignore any suggestion from her that she wished them.		Had Mrs C withdrawn consent? Did she have capacity to withdraw consent? Would the drugs given to her have affected her ability to withdraw consent?		kirked-cc1ueej31ah1q7bh80b9eqm4w3cd62bvx4fn8cwm6fsa58gpih2g8kd4bg8lg1qubg2qg64dzey275540aumahuze0mv1m

Or else a long way around the globe.   And strangely, the timing of your post says you came after Silverfox, when the content looks as if they were replying to yours.  Another board glitch? I'll ask the IT gurus.	But anyway, it has always been my understanding that someone who has been premedicated cannot give consent, which in the current practice of admission as late as possible before operation denies some nervous people of that opportunity.  Once a patent is anaesthetised, the question of withdrawing thir consent does not arise, and it's a pity that the UK has not followed the practice of other countries, or that of dental surgery, in allowing the operator to supervise sedation.  	Because I sympathise with the operator.  They have nearly completed the procedure - to withdraw now wastes time, effort, cost and will expose the patient to the same risk on a second occasion, doubling that risk. If some one else were at the head-end, who could more closley reassure the anxious patient, thier anxiety might not overload, and equally there might be fewer overdoses. I admire the reassurance skills of nurses, but they cannot titrate doses of sedatives, only give them on instruction, in this situation from the distracted operator.	For it is difficult to say that a patient asking, telling you to stop cannot withdraw their consent, even if they are sedated. The effect of benzodiazepines is similar to that of alcohol, they 'disinhibit' the patient. So the repressed office worker becomes a sexual pest at the Xmas office party, and the patient who has their anxiety under control loses it when sedated and stressed by the procedure.  Silverfox, for this reason I don't agree that "Versed" (AKA UK midazolam) is an excellent drug, and fentanyl is one that few understand.   While rapid in effect and apparently offset too, it is actually one of the slowest drugs to be excreted. In small dose this doesn't matter, even when the excretion half life is about six hours, but give more than a little and you run into problems.   ALWAYS have naloxone and flumazenil to hand, but remember that the half life of naloxone is much, much less than fentanyl.	Anaesthetists might more likely to use a propofol infusion with either alfentanyl which has a much shorter half life, or remifentanyl which is so quickly broken down that it too must be given by infusion.  This technique is more flexible and less likely to overdose the patient.   The alfentanyl and propofol combination is used in the UK in Emergency Departments for sedation for dislocation reduction and other painful procedures.  By adopting strict guidelines it has proved successful and safe, despite the alarmist concerns of anaesthetists, including this one, but as far as I know has not been used in cardiology labs.

Although I've myself repeated the trainingmantra of 'stop when the patient says stop' it's not as black and white as suggested by SILVRFOX (even though I feel at one with him because of the name which has also been applied to me!) Whistle-blowing by other staff should not occur in a functional team where each member is properly and fully involved and where decisions are properly discussed. Even then the final responsibility ends up beingwith one person ratherthan distributed.	There's an additional risk to the ones listed by John D. There are times in many procedures when, to stop, would risk a serious or fatal occurrence. Imagine, for example, the colonoscopic removal of a large polyp using snare diathermy. When half way through the stalk it's not usuallyan option to abandon the procedure, one has to finish safely without rushing. Similarly, with coronary procedures, I imagine that it could be disastrous to withdraw as a stent is being deployed to treat a lesion likely to cause an imminent complete blockage of a coronary artery. Whilst the patient might well claim later to have had full capacity, it's quite possible that theycould claim the opposite if the procedure was abandoned and the patient suffered serious harm.	It's these decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and with competing risks that make these detailedcases valuable for all clinicians to consider.	The original consent is another topic but I would suggest it's impossible for patients to make a fully informed decision if the operator describes a general position of " In skilled and experienced hands problems are uncommon" rather than giving their own results.-vj3c8ck2h2imgzbw0fue4d4bzewkvd8d8e

I recall the evening ward round with a youngish women complaining that she had not yet had her procedure , when we had curtailed this hours before at her request.	As regards the big polyps : an anecdote , I recall being persuaded by a surgical colleague to "have a go" at a vast beast (4cms+)in an elderly man. Half way through I chickened out of this very firm , very thick stalk , dismantled the snare and came out with a view to seeking surgical help. Encouraged to keep going (if you can do it it will save the patient from surgery which may kill him) I went back in and using another snare all went well. Not perhaps now , when there is so much experience of when and how to tackle these things , but there have been times when I think cardiac monitoring advisable for the operator rather than for the patient?	 The realisation of slipping out of one's depth mid procedure is of great educational value but there is a problem if it happens too often.-xn4a30a

There is a big - and i think to some extent unresolved issue around sedation. The anaesthesia recomendations are not ideal when involved in what is essentially terminal care. In those circumstances I think one has to be prepared to step outside eg give adequate pain relief but know how to give it. This was not infrequent a problem when stenting oesophageal malignancy. Awaiting amaesthetic cover for the procedure may mean postponing it (nil by mouth etc... ) for a week , which can be an appreciable proportion of remaining life and stopping the patient returning home. So one also needs education on how to break the excellent safety rules : the harm can be in NOT going ahead or leaving the patient in distress?	I recall one patient - treated by laser elsewhere - where much of the mediastinum had been damaged - the gullet lumen just led into a gaping hole shared with both main bronchi. Of course one could have come out and postponed everything but the sensible course of action seemed to be to slip a stent in whilst keeping the patient comfortable. It seemed to work. How should I have interpreted "Do no harm" - discontinue ? Not give analgaesia if the patient had pain?	All eventualities cannot be foreseen although this is less of a problem now. Part of teaching fundamentals is so that the doctor can make decisions when a new scenario emerges. As a general observation our guidelines aim at a medical version of safety - but sometimes the patient may be just as concerned with pain relief , something which is often neglected.-fi7bd87b

May I just add part of Dr M's statement directly relevant to the issue of IV sedation and the possible problems with terminating the procedure (in line with comments already posted):	"I do not recall Mrs C requesting the procedure to stop at this point. However, the procedure had now turned into a medical emergency and I was not concentrating on conversations with Mrs C, but rather was concentrating on saving her life and ensuring that all necessary analgesics and sedatives were provided to make her as comfortable as possible in the circumstance. It is possible that Mrs C asked for the procedure to stop due to the pain of predominantly the blocked coronary artery, and also secondarily due to the radial spasms. If Mrs C had asked for the procedure to stop it would not have been possible to do so at this stage without catastrophic and life threatening consequences. I do not recall feeling at any point that Mrs C was "withdrawing consent" and I would certainly recall if this was the case. I do not undertake any invasive procedure without consent unless it is a lifesaving emergency situation. In this case, Mrs C was in a critical situation very soon after the start of the procedure and needed rapid emergency treatment. In this situation it is my job, and the job of the nurses, to try and relieve the patient of any pain and reassure them. I note that intravenous diazepam, midazolam and morphine were administered to Mrs C to provide pain relief and to give sedation. We had a low threshold to give sedative and opiate analgesics intravenously for pain in the catheterisation lab in 2009. We would give as much analgesia as needed and the dose may vary between individuals. Mrs C received multiple doses of diazepam, midazolam and morphine. My angiogram report says a total of 13mg morphine and 6mg of diazepam was administered soon after Mrs C experienced pain. As these are given intravenously, their effect is almost instantaneous. It is standard practice for the nurses to be talking to the patient throughout the angiogram procedure and explain what is happening, as the operator is under great pressure and needs to make very important decisions quickly. However, explaining what is happening to a patient who is in pain and under the influence of the above mentioned drugs is very difficult. I note that that Mrs C says that she believes she may have lost consciousness and she states that her recollection of events is patchy. The diazepam and morphine could have caused her to have a period of no recollection/ 13mg of morphine is a high dose for patient not accustomed to taking morphine and 6mg of diazepam is enough to make a person of low body weight such as Mrs C very sleepy'.	kirked-qk6e6foiuf8h1h2l7imck3gxik60aum

I would however argue with his description of the effects of midazolam and morphine as being "almost instantaneous". The maximum effect of morphine, even IV,takes place five to ten minutes after administration, and midazolam is only a little quicker. That "13mg of morphine is a high dose for patient not accustomed to taking morphine and 6mg of diazepam is enough to make a person of low body weight such as Mrs C very sleepy" is indeed true, and I fear may be the result of repeated titration without adequate time for effect.	But in the situation he describes, what else is the operator to do, assisted only by an even skillful and careful nurse?	John-1yuzgaaa5b7f4hteaaa

I used to prefer diamorphine as the drug I knew (liked to have it available if used rarely). My impression has always been that it acts very quickly but the evidence that it is faster than morphine seems in doubt. Minute doses repeated always seemed well tolerated and had some effect very , very quickly.and I can't recall any problems - and by nature I tend to recall bad moments rather than good. I have always had a suspicion that those who run into problems with diazepam/midazolam +/- opiates give too much , too quickly and forget the phenomenal individual variations in response. And how the patient may remain apparently unsedated then suddenly becomes almost anaesthetised. I remember one very experiences endoscopist who used a whiff of benzodiazepine followed by whiffs of IV pethidine for painful moments when colonoscoping children - when I watched him these were pretty alert but relaxed as patients.	In the old days when I was student and junior significant gut bleeds were given IM morphine as a routine as part of good - somewhat "holistic" care.	A bad moment I do recall is the chap with an alarming arterial bleed from a duodenal ulcer - I stopped it enough to clear the picture but in doing so I think some of the adrenaline must have caused a short lived period of mesenteric ischaemia. His pain was truly dramatic but thankfully very short lived. He made good progress but these events are reminders how readily some of what we do can cause major distress. The patient did very well as regards this pain and his bleeding.... Ischaemia - heart , limbs , gut seems to have a severity of pain warranting compassion with whatever acts quickest and provides the basis for some of the trials.-

The 'anaesthetic' morphine analogues are so much quicker in onset - fentanyl 90 seconds to maximum - that the same variation has less significance.	And yes, in expert hands, the crudest or most difficult techniques can be problem free, but that is not a reason for the non-expert to use them!  If I had my time again, I'd be evangelising for anaesthetists at endoscopies.  After all, the dentists had to take them on, but then they were killing their patients (cruel, but true!) and today most surgeons who want to operate under a local anaesthetic are glad to have an anaesthetist either administer the local, unless it's field infiltration, or to supervise sedation.	The only "operator/anaesthetists" left are endoscopists!	John-ttyb90ab2f9e3i

I was appointed to help set up an endoscopy and gastro service and at the first meeting anaesthetists were represented but seemed relieved to find their services not needed. At that time there would nave been no question of new appointments to cover these new lists.	I think it would be a bad use of anaesthetic time for them to be routinely present for lists - just to give an IV injection and then stand back ? Of course those patients where there really might be a problem would need an experienced person , so someone relatively inexperienced might be no better than being just another pair of hands.	The biggest problem is that by its nature acute gastroenterology can be very uncertain. It is in the flexibility where problems are most likely to occur. You may not be of the same breed , but I can assure some in your specialty are very political and this leaves me wary about a system that puts one group so much in control as to stop a functioning clinical service without good evidence based on current practice. In years gone by , wearing a physician hat , I used to carry out some "desentisisation" injections -- perhaps something else where an anaesthetist should be present?	Life has changed a lot over the years - I suspect most routine endoscopies are carried out without sedation now. In the past there was clearly oversedation of many patients. Some publications gave doses I would have been ashamed to put into print and the obsession with sticking to a single drug meant that it could be singularly ineffective even in massive doses.	What would seem to me as a useful compromise is to have a system of checking that those involved in endoscopy have to have some form of sedation accreditation , perhaps regularly reviewed. Personally I have always thought those doing tickier precedures at the top end should be reasonably adept at tracheal intubation-again with regular training days to ensure skills are maintained. Particularly on the limitations of pulse oximetry.	There are times when one has to balance the needs of the patient in terms of prompt action against the theoretical aspects of minmal risk. Major changes in policy should be evidence based. I can think of several crises occurring during OGD lists but not many where an anaesthetist presence would have been crucial. I can think of several where I would have liked one to be present or readily available - foreign body extractions always made me anxious about dropping them into youtr territory.	Should I ever need an OGD , would I want an anaesthetist present ? No , I think not . Would I wish to have tracheal intubation "just to be on the safe side" - particularly if this involved sedation which would not otherwise be needed ? Almost definitely not. Would I like an anaesthetist to be present in the building during certain "routine" dental procedures ? Almost certainly yes but in my personal experience of several anaesthetics , the problems they have caused have outweighed the complications of the surgery so perhaps I am biased.	We are moving into an era where an obsession with certain protocols can result in inferior care - an aspect of defensive medicine. We need good evidence (up to date ) evidence to change policies.-7p0go6g

Forwhen you describe the way of the anaesthetist, "just to give an IV injection and then stand back ", I am indeed crying in the wilderness. I don't think a surgeon or anyone else who has worked with anaesthetists would recognise that description. May I tell you what anaesthetists really do?	The essence of anaesthesia is constant vigilance, for the patient andthe operator to anticipate both their needs, to monitor by direct observation and physiological measurement, and to provide immediate correction of any disturbance of the patient's equilibrium. I'm sorry that your appreciationofthe speciality of Anaesthesiais so limited.	John-w6tab8fae1laa1iaaa1jziaaa7ac3a

So high that I think their time should be used wisely and I do not see routine endoscopy lists as having that place particularly with the fully conscious unsedated patient. There are plenty of medical patients on the wards where the very skills you mention would be appropriate and if numbers allow perhaps that is where the extra time should be spent in the first instance ?	Of course any procedure has risks but when there are problems we need to recognise why these have occurred - failure to recognise the high risk patient , poor technique , mismanagement of any drugs used etc.... For endoscopy lists one.. would need to know how often an anaesthetist would have made a difference to unforeseen problems. And how many anaesthetists would be required to cover 10 - 20 lists per week with 10-15 patients on each list. Plus of course those available 24/7 in case of major gut bleeds requiring fairly immediate assessment and treatment. Problems arising from delays because of lack of anaesthetic availability should then count in the balance as anaesthetic deaths?	And that is before we start allocation of anaesthetic time to every dental surgery ....	I think we need a healthy dose of realism in planning services.-

For the process of consent to be valid it must be freely given (i.e. without duress) and several factors should have been in the mix of matters	discussed by Doctor and patient. A Doctor should ensure the patient knows why a procedure is proposed, what the major risks involved are in his specific case, the risks in relation to the hoped for benefits,	alternatives to the procedure and risks of not carrying out the procedure. The Doctor has a further duty to ensure the information is given in an understandable way. The patient can of course ask questions	and highlight specific areas that may concern him. The Doctor should have some idea what risks or negative effects of the procedure might be of concern to the patient. For example risk of total paralysis from surgery may be a real concern for the patient even if the absolute risk is very slight.		Consent can be withheld or withdrawn at any time irrespective whether the withdrawal seems rational or irrational to the Doctor. But, the patient needs capacity to withdraw consent. To proceed in the absence of	Consent can amount to battery. This is made more difficult when medication has been administered. Does the drug, its route and dose affect ability to consent one way or the other? As is always the case with medical duty the Bolam Test, as modified by Bolitho (the reasonable body of medical opinion whose practice must be logically defensible) is key. A Judge is helped to understand what a reasonable Doctor might have done in the given circumstances by medical expert witnesses. In the NHS there is also general guidance on consent and NICE guidance. There is also the Mental Capacity Act and recent court judgements on consent. Whether Consent was withdrawn must be a finding of fact based on the specific circumstances of the case. This is made more difficult when medication has been administered. Does the drug, its route and dose affect ability to consent one way or the other?		In this case the judgement went against Mrs C. The first question was whether initial consent for the Angiogram was flawed. The Judge was helped with this question by both medical experts who were in agreement that although there were some problems with terminology used '..there was no Breach of Duty in respect of obtaining informed consent prior to undertaking the angiogram . In particular they agree that there was no duty to inform of specific risks of dissection or spasm  whether the artery was stenosed in an otherwise healthy artery. Both experts also agree that there was no Breach of Duty in respect of the information sheet provided. If the Court finds that 'the Claimant was informed orally that the risk of stroke and heart attack was only present if she had arteries that were not healthy' - both experts agree this to be misleading and inaccurate if stated, but not Breach of Duty'.		The Judge had concerns about Mrs C's evidence. There were inconsistencies between her written statements and her oral evidence:		'...I have to say that, in general, I did not find Mrs C a witness upon whose evidence I felt confident to rely....Similar comments may be made of her evidence before me including that given in cross-examination in	respect of her medical and smoking history, the events leading up to, and of, the angiogram procedure, the extent of her recovery and the detail of her claim for damages. I consider that over the years, as a	result of the undoubted misfortune of this angiogram procedure that went wrong, Mrs C has persuaded herself of the correctness of a case on a number of issues in this case that are not correct and the question	under review is one of them'		The Judge found that Mrs C did not have capacity to withdraw consent at the material time she claims she did so and had the procedure been abandoned Mrs C would very likely have died.		The Judge recognised that cases such as this are complex and assessing whether a patient at the material time had capacity to withdraw consent is not easy. Inevitably, it will involve reviewing all medical and	nursing notes made at the time. The quality and clarity of such notes will matter greatly. This case is a reminder that if legal action is brought against a Doctor or Trust it will likely take several years.	Doctors cannot possibly remember every patient they interact with so their medical notes should be impeccable.		Kirked-dl1jhcwftbr9zrh1gwa99dskiaz84cjeqnka5nk4qohmi2hme300073o

There is an enormous grey area which I think the judge recognises. We can have broad comments about consent after sedation. In practice at one extreme are those who have had sedation the night before and who may well have some lasting effect. , At the other , with Iv sedation some seem fairly impervious to the effects , others go out like a light. Against these one has to weigh the relevance of the procedure - asking for a routine colonoscopy to be discontinued against stopping the bleeding post -polypectomy. The effect of an excess anxiety about cancer can be far more of an influence on mental function than sedation in some patients.	Ther are no guarantees that we will always "get it right". Sticking by rules too rigidly may also be bad medicine at times , just as with guidelines. One just needs to be clear about what one's justification for breaching them. Besides , our decision about which procedures require written consent are pretty pragmatic and unwitnessed verbal consent seems to me a pretty inadequate substitute.-jd3a

It is a terribly sad case where a very close family suffered disaster following an act of altruism.		Mr A had been undergoing renal dialysis for several years and was on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. His son Mr B (age 35) was anxious to give his father the opportunity of a better quality of life in his well earned retirement by donating his right kidney. This he duly did. However, the operation was carried out negligently - and to a degree recklessly. Proceedings against the surgeon by the GMC were undertaken.		The consequences of the negligent surgery have been catastrophic for Mr B and his family: physically, psychologically, emotionally and financially. Although the patient's right kidney was successfully removed and transplanted, Mr B suffered irreversible failure of the left kidney. In fact he should never have been advised to undergo the operation at all given the grave dangers involved. That negligent advice was compounded by serial mistakes during the operation itself. Mr B's life was saved only after many hours on the operating table during which he received over 100 units of blood and fluid transfusions.		During the course of the operation Mr B suffered a Myocardial Infarction; ischaemic damage to the lumbo-sacral plexus and an Inferior Vena Cava thrombosis. He was left in total renal failure. He was in hospital for nearly two months, during which he started to receive haemodialysis three times a week. He also developed a serious drug induced confusional disorder. This treatment affected him profoundly. He became severely depressed, frequently contemplating suicide. He contracted serious infections, one of which necessitated a further admission to hospital.		Mr B's own act of altruism in donating a kidney to his father, which cost him so dear, was reciprocated by his sister. She donated a kidney to Mr B at very considerable psychological and emotional cost. That operation was successful. It released the claimant from an indefinite regime of dialysis. However, he lives with the constant fear that his body will reject the kidney and it is common ground that when he reaches his early sixties that kidney will require replacement. This uncertainty, and his experiences generally, have left him with an understandable obsession about his health.		Unfortunately a recurrent infection was imported with his sister's kidney - Cytomegalovirus. This is a constant source of worry. He has been advised that his renal failure increases significantly the risk that he will suffer from ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Consequently he adopts a very careful lifestyle and diet. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels which cause him constant worry. The immuno-suppressant drugs he takes, in particular to control the CMV, greatly increase the risk of his developing other debilitating and life threatening conditions. The consequence is that he has become fastidious to the point of obsessional about personal and general hygiene, which impacts upon the whole family. He can be irritable and overbearing. He is prone to bouts of weeping.		There are further serious physical consequences. The nerve damage suffered during the negligent operation has resulted in altered sensation below the right knee. There is hyper-sensitivity, pain and loss of sensation in various parts of the right foot, and clawing of the first and second toes. He has had surgery on the first toe. Further surgery had been planned to straighten and fuse the toes but this may be avoided by regular injection of botulinum toxin for life. The issue surrounding this problem with his foot has a bearing on his residual earning capacity. Currently he is unable to run, and walking on uneven ground and stairs presents some difficulty.		Mr B has also been much distressed by urinary difficulties. For a time self- catheterisation was attempted. He found it a dreadful experience. Urinary frequency bedevils his daily life, and results in broken nights for him and for his wife. The medication he takes has had unpleasant side-effects including the profuse growth of unwanted body hair, the development of skin acneiform lesions and the deposit of facial and abdominal fat. His inability to exercise has also led to undesirable weight gain. Prior to the operation, the claimant was a healthy, fit and active 35 year old man. He took great pride in his health and fitness, running several kilometres each morning to set himself up for the working day. He had enormous energy. He was cheerful, optimistic and extrovert. Now the picture is very different. At the age of 39 his daily life revolves around his health worries. He is constantly fearful of infection or changes which may increase the risk of the kidney being rejected. Any venturing from the strictly enforced hygiene of the home is fraught with anxiety. He lives with the certain knowledge that the kidney will require replacement by the time he reaches the age of 61 and that this will be preceded by symptoms of progressive renal failure. It is agreed that his life expectancy has been reduced by 10 years.		Mr B is a shadow of his former self. He is lacking in energy. He is exhausted by 9 pm and generally has to be in bed by 10 pm. He is moody and irritable. His marriage, though very strong, is constantly under strain. The children have been affected and distressed by their father's condition and behaviour and he has bridges to build there.		Prior to the transplant Mr B was a very successful and well paid executive on the verge of setting up his own company.		After a long and extremely complex process of financial assessment for damages and estimated projection for future loss of earnings and medical expenses Mr B was awarded the following:				Item Amount                                        Judgment	General damages                                    168,000 	Past losses inclusive of interest                          287,500 	Future losses (other than earnings and medical expenses)    432,500 	Medical expenses & treatment                          167,757 	Loss of earnings to the age of 65                        4,580,869 	Loss of earnings after the age of 65                      68,891 	Deduction for residual earning capacity                [less164,108] 	Capital loss of sale of the business                       1,199,237 	Total award                                          6,740,646 		Kirked-f05o3npb36b8bu4ad01d8cqb23d4uy5bia15aieoiddpbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb1abbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb9bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb3ebbb4bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbba9bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbba4cbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbba4cbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb8cbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbzbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbo119qzcsdyerese3dse5e

Until the late 1980's damages were paid in a lump sum. It did not matter that the compensation was for losses that might be suffered in the future: both the monthly wage that the accident/negligence victim may have lost, and the continuing costs of care that would have to be met, were compensated by one large payment. This could be problematic for the claimant (patient). The responsibility for investing the money wisely is significant. When a defendant agrees a lump sum rather than a periodic payment settlement, they are also offloading considerable financial risk onto the claimant. While the scale of lump sum payments in serious injury cases can make them seem like giant windfalls, they also carry with them a range of financial risks. For example, inflation will gradually erode the value of the payment and returns on lump sum investments may be taxed, while the income paid by an annuity is tax free. These risks can be mitigated with expert financial planning, but the elephant in the room - the mortality risk - cannot. If the claimant lives longer than predicted, there is the very real danger that the money awarded in a lump sum will run out.		A structured settlement usually takes the following form. The defendant's insurer, having agreed a lump sum figure, will arrange to convert part of that sum into a series of periodic payments structured to accommodate the claimants individual needs. To fund the arrangement, the liability insurer purchases annuities from a life office, and assigns the benefit of them to the claimant. However, NHS Trusts may prefer to self fund settlements (see below). The arrangement clearly can be especially advantageous financially if there is dispute about the claimants life expectancy.		Because settlements from trusts ultimately derive from the public purse there are an increasing number of cases where payments made are recouped upon death of the claimant (see http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-22553341 as an example). In Mr B's case if he died earlier than anticipated (which is a very real probability of which the pt is aware) payments would usually stop unless there are dependants reliant upon him - this will usually have been considered in the original settlement.		As an aside, the government has guaranteed these NHS self-funded structures and claimants can be assured that their future payments are copper-bottomed. However, these savings to the NHS do not accrue without risk to public funds. There is a potential problem involved in the NHS acting as if it were a miniature life insurer by accepting continuing, uncertain, liabilities into the future. The National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) handles financial and claims responsibility for cases of clinical negligence. It automatically considers the possibility of a structure in any claim which is likely to exceed 250,000 and a few hundred NHS structures have been put in place to date. The concept is particularly attractive to the NHS. However defendant Trusts can self-fund the continuing payments involved in a structure instead of parting with a lump sum to buy annuities from the insurance market. They can then keep the cash in-house and thus avoid the problems caused by the loss of large capital payments. In the past, the amounts needed for lump sum awards have fluctuated widely, and their payment could have dramatic effects upon health care budgets: major capital expenditure was deferred and even wards closed. Self-funded structures thus make more money available to the NHS in the short term. This is especially attractive to a Government keen to increase the resources immediately available for health care. It is of course debatable whether this really means more resources and services available to patients!		kirked-3o6hucwa55iyqzf8mrnomu0ay35asy8143apja670byzd

We know nothing about the dynamics within this familywhich, tragically,ended up much worse off as a family than if the father had waited for a kidney but I find it difficult to imagine that I would allow any of my children to put their ownlife at suchsignificant risk if I were in a similar position to the father. Obviously there are lesser degrees of risk donating blood for exampleor even bone marrow but the risks of nephrectomy would be beyond consideration. I stress again that this is purely a personal opinion but I would be interested to read others' views.	Altruism is always a tricky concept. In this family's case I'm sure it was as pure as it gets but there have certainly been concerns about the wider aspects of family donations in the past. I once worked as a lecturer/SR on a large London renal unit and we were asked to work up a living donor transplant where the young family member donor was being flown in from abroad. It didn't take me long to see that the donation was anything but voluntary and informed. I am pleased that my senior colleagues agreed to halt the process.

I have kept your explanation for reference. Maxim I don't expect your renal unit was a vast distance from the Blind Beggar ? Did you come across Rod Dathan who I gather has just died. He was one of the first batch of doctors when the renal unit opened at the London. A psychiatric patient jumped from the top floor and landed on the unit roof. Rod made a comment about their knowing they were waiting for a donor , but never expected him to come through the ceiling. .. Perhaps we should have a thread sometime on the use of sick humour by doctors.	In those early days there was considerable screening of patients for dialysis - I became aware of this whilst working on the psychiatric unit , but I have the impression that everyone is a bit more gung-ho these days.	Just what is it that drives some folk to donate a kidney in an apparently totally altruistic way? Presumably different factors may apply for different folk. I doubt whether the dynamics of within family donations can ever be fully unravelled - I too would not want to accept a donation from offspring , nor would I expect my parents to have accepted one from me - but would have felt donation from paret to offspring as pretty natural . Nor would I have had any compunction about being a donor for my wife - or do I just say that because compatibility is less likely ? The domino system clearly has considerable self interest involved.	As I have said previously , I am not in favour of the present system of looking at recipients purely on the grounds of "medical need" , nor do I think we should encourage Joe Public to see organ donation (or blood transfusion) as a "right" without responsibility. I see that there have been some fairly outspoken views from the transplant world of late suggesting essentially that we should re-visit some of the basic ethical issues of how we should use what is essentially a limited resource and which will remain limited even if an opt out system is adopted.-zn6c74a2nogqv

Posted by sken	Did you 'misspeak' about blood transfusion, Sken? While no one has a right to medical treatment, once a doctor has accepted their duty of care, then transfusion has be considered, and is about the lowest risk transplant (except posssible faecal!).	But I would agree about responsibility. I think that blood donation should be more than a responsibility, it should be a civic duty, along with voting, jury serviceand paying local or national taxes. Only a medical exemption, or possibly 'reasons of concience' backed up by memebship of thr Witnesses and evidence of regular worship at the Kingdom Hall would excuse. In fact, it should be a prerequisite for receiving free treatment from the NHS!	JOhn-ni1aa6o0aa6ba9j9aaa1o

I see an essential difference between resources paid for out of taxation and those which rely on a considerable amount of voluntary contribution, So Joe Public has a right to a blood transfusion IF the appropriate blood is available and indicated as part of medical treatment , but is not in a position to make a legitimate complaint if as an individual they have done nothing to ensure adequate supplies and there is a shortage. There is a grounds for complaint for very different reasons if doctors have been very wasteful of this resource or reasonable steps have not been taken to manage the supply. In those instances it is perhaps the donors who have the greatest grounds to complain.	The suggestion is being made that those who have agreed to organ donation should be given preference if there is a need to receive . Clearly this would need to have been over a period of time - a person who needs a transplant and then volunteers to go on the donor list would defeat the object...	I think the good news is that , as it has become appreciated by some ethnic minority groups that their need for donation is higher than average and best match organs will come from within their own group , that more potential donors are emerging within the group.	I think your comparison of blood donation with jury service a brilliant one and it could be used to register blood groups for all potential donors so there would be an as and when reserve on a universal scale in addition to the present system and not just relying on known donors.-s45bnl

Posted by Maxim	Many thanks Maxim,		Reckless in a legal sense implies that the Doctor recognised that a particular course of action carries the real risk of harm but he carries on regardless and the harm materialises. Of course the fact that harm occurred and the Doctor knew such harm might occur does not automatically mean he has done anything wrong. He may have chosen the best option out of several poor options. As a general proposition recklessness can lead to a charge of gross negligence (eg Gross Negligence Manslaughter) which attracts criminal liability - the negligence is so egregious.		As far as the law is concerned it makes no difference that the donor is a family member.		I would not allow either of my children to undergo Nephrectomy nor expose them to the unseen future of having one kidney only for my benefit even though Dialysis is unappealing. Every family has its own dynamics and history (or as Tolstoy said 'All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way') and must make its own decisions on how they help each other. There is no doubt that the problems encountered in this case have had a very bad effect on some of the interpersonal relationships within this family.		Kirked-fb8ezisa2oma7dwd2d8gpgphod3cyhry6c11a

On arrival at work (about 7.30am) his wife was already on the phone telling him she felt ill, had chest pain and was very nauseous. He went back home immediately. On arrival his wife was anxious, hot, still had chest pain and having difficulty breathing. Mr Blue called the GP practice. Dr A said he would be there shortly. A little before his arrival an ambulance had been summoned by Mrs Blue's mother. It arrived before the GP.	Dr A arrived at about 8.40 a.m. He was not Mrs Blue's normal general practitioner. Indeed, he had not dealt with her before, although her parents were patients of his. She seemed to be having chest pain. He was unsure what the cause was but decided to admit her to hospital with a possible diagnosis of heart attack. Having made that decision the hospital was bound to admit her (his reasoning). He telephoned the Coronary Care Unit at the Royal Infirmary. He told them that Mrs Blue was having severe chest pain. Normally he would write a letter which would go with the patient in the ambulance but he could not recall if in the urgency of the situation he did so on this occasion. Dr A gave Mrs Blue an injection of nalbuphine. He could not remember whether and to what extent it had been effective. Mrs Blue was taken by ambulance to the Coronary Care Unit. Mr Blue followed in a car. When he saw her on CCU she was still distressed but was no longer in pain - it was now 10.45 a.m. She said she had experienced a queer feeling coming over her with tightening in her chest over the heart and pain in her left arm. Mr Blue stayed with her for about an hour and then left so that her parents could see her. He went home.	On her admission an ecg was immediately recorded. On CCU Dr R had 3 ECGs all timed 8.53am and all he described as normal. Dr R took a history from Mrs Blue which he noted as follows:"Severe central chest pain radiating across chest and into back starting at 8.00 a.m. and lasting about 30 minutes. Not radiating to neck. Some 'heaviness' in arms. Associated breathlessness. Pain no longer present. No previous similar pain. No palpitations."	He then noted Mrs Blue's previous medical history, family history and social history. The only items of significance from a cardiac point of view were a strong family history on her father's side of ischaemic heart disease and that she smoked 15 cigarettes a day. Dr R then carried out a thorough examination of her. He noted that she was "anxious ++". She was very upset and crying when he first saw her. There was no evidence of Myocardial Infarction on the ECG but he asked that it should be repeated in one hour. He also asked for a full blood count, biochemical screening, enzyme tests and a chest x-ray. Dr R was with Mrs Blue for about 30-45 minutes and was noting his findings as he went along. The notes then went on to a trolley in the ward where all such notes were kept.	The repeat ECG was taken shortly after midday. The T-waves in leads V1 and V2 were now inverted and those in V3 flat. Dr R and the Consultant Cardiologist (Dr J) noted the findings but no particular action was taken at that time. On his ward round at about 4.00 p.m. Dr J first saw Mrs Blue. Dr R was with him. So was a member of the nursing staff. Before he saw her he read and considered Dr R's notes of the history and his examination. He was aware of the ECG traces taken at 8.53 a.m. The change in the trace taken at midday had also been drawn to his attention. He regarded it as a slight change which could be due to many causes, only one of which was cardiac disease. He considered that the change was not compatible with acute myocardial infarction. Dr J took a history from Mrs Blue and examined her. When he saw her she was calm and seemed well. Her vital signs - pulse and blood pressure - were normal. She conversed with Dr J in an articulate way. Nothing that Dr J got from his examination was materially different from what Dr R had found in the morning. Dr J came to the view that Mrs Blue's symptoms were not cardiac in origin but were oesophageal. In order, however, to cover the outside chance that there had been a silent myocardial infarction at some earlier time prior to the event which led to Mrs Blue's admission he asked for the enzyme tests which had been done to be checked. He stated 'that such tests, based on a blood sample taken shortly after the patient's admission, could not reveal whether the pain which had led to her admission was due to a myocardial infarction; it was too soon for that. But if the enzyme tests were normal that Mrs Blue could go home'. He prescribed maalox. He noted all this in the hospital records. Dr R telephoned the laboratory to get the results of the enzyme tests. They were normal. Dr R then wrote the discharge note addressed the general practitioner. In it he wrote, inter alia: "No ECG changes". The diagnosis was given as oesophageal spasm. A fuller, typed report to the general practitioner, giving more detail, followed later.	Dr R phoned Mr Blue and told him that the problem was not heart related but was an oesophageal spasm. On the way home they went and got the maalox. They got home at about 6.00 p.m. Mr Blue got his wife some tea and made her comfortable. She went to bed early, at about 7.00 p.m. An hour or so later she complained of pain in her chest and he reported this to Dr A by telephone. Dr A told him to let him know if there was any further change. Mrs Blue settled for a while but at about 11.00 p.m. complained again, more strongly this time, of chest pain. Mr Blue telephoned Dr A and told him. Dr A came out and examined her. He told Mr Blue that it might be a few days before the pain disappeared. Shortly thereafter Mr Blue retired to bed. At about 4.30 a.m. his wife woke him complaining again of severe pains in the chest. She said she could not bear it. Mr Blue telephoned Dr A who came out again immediately. By the time he arrived Mrs Blue's condition had worsened. She became hysterical then collapsed without a pulse. Dr A told Mr Blue to call for an ambulance, which he did. In the meantime Dr A started CPR. When the ambulance arrived defibrillation was attempted but without response. Mrs Blue was taken by ambulance to the Accident and Emergency Department in infirmary. From there she was taken to theatre but all attempts at resuscitation failed. She was pronounced dead at 5.50 a.m.		Post mortem examination of the deceased's body revealed the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was severely atheromatous over the proximal 6 cms with 70% occlusion of the lumen and an e-centric plaque. The circumflex branch was also severely atheromatous with up to 90% luminal obliteration. The right coronary artery showed circumferential atheroma with approximately 40% narrowing and 3 cms from the origin there was an area of plaque rupture with associated haemorrhage. Death was due to coronary artery disease. The area of plaque rupture, possibly complicated by overlying thrombus, would have accounted for her presenting symptoms. Mottling found on the myocardium was consistent with a very recent infarction, probably less than 8 hours before death.	Expert medical opinion will follow. The crux of the legal complaint was that it had been negligent to discharge Mrs Blue in light of her presentation, clinical and ECG findings and family history. Further that it was Dr J's duty to keep the deceased in hospital for at least 24 hours, that is, until at least 9.30 a.m. on the following day.

As I find myself with a bit of time I'll volunteer a few provocative comments to kick off.	Although this occurred over twenty years ago I think you could see the same thought processes and decisions being made today. Yes, it's easy to be wise in retrospect but this mistake has been made so many times that you might think the lesson could be available to all but still it happens. Why?	Given that the pain was clearlycompatible with a diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease withtwo strong risk factorsand there were changing ECG signs ( the word 'slight' is one of the most dangerous in Medicine) you wonder what thinking justified discharge that same day. Even today there's often a misunderstanding that normal levels of troponins exclude a serious ischaemic process when they do no such thing.	You could identify several cognitive errors but Isuspect one of the most commoncauses for premature and unsafedischarge is thedemand tofree bedsfor other admissions who are often less ill than those being discharged. Those who pressurise clinicians to make rash decisions are never the ones to appear in court.	Whether this was called negligence was a legal decision but the real shame is that such cases don't result in prevention across the board.

Your comments about freeing up beds is absolutely correct in this case.	Plaintiff expert medical opinion - Dr Moon Key points:		He noted Dr R's examination of the deceased that there was a strong family history on her father's side of ischaemic heart disease and that she was a smoker. These factors increased the likelihood of coronary heart disease even in the case of a woman aged 35, who was basically in a very low probability category for such disease.		Dr Moon thought, however, that the symptoms recorded by Dr R were much more likely to have a cardiac origin than oesophageal, although he accepted that they could be the latter.		The normal ECGs at 8.53 a.m. did not exclude the possibility that a myocardial infarction had occurred at home that morning, and a further ECG in one hour would not do so either. It took longer for ECG changes to evolve. His practice would be to take a further ECG 24 hours later. It was, however, reasonable practice to repeat the ECG at midday, as had been done.		The changes from the ecg(s) taken at 8.53 a.m. were not diagnostic of heart attack but they did increase the likelihood that the deceased's chest pain was cardiac in origin. They made it more likely that the deceased was suffering from an acute coronary syndrome. Continued observation and further evaluation were therefore required.		The the correct practice in 1991 was to test a small range of enzymes (LDH & AAT) in order to diagnose whether a myocardial infarction had occurred. These enzymes are released from the heart muscle, but only slowly, and are not seen at relevant levels for a number of hours after the suspected myocardial infarction, a minimum of 8 hours but nearer to 12 hours. Therefore the blood sample which enables the enzymes to be tested should not be taken until that period has elapsed, in this case until at earliest the late afternoon on 12 June.		It was appropriate for Dr J to order enzyme tests to be done and if they were normal, for the deceased to be discharged, but it was inappropriate to base the tests on a blood sample taken at 9.30 that morning. Of the two enzymes tested AAT shows a raised level earlier and reduces to a normal level earlier. LDH takes longer to show a raised level and remains high for longer.		Nevertheless Dr Moon accepted that, although a wrong diagnosis was in fact made in this case, the probability that someone such as the deceased who presents with chest pain but has a normal ECG has actually had a heart attack is low.		Second expert plaintiff opinion - Dr Woods Key points:		The pt was displaying some of the classic symptoms of a cardiac problem and the possibility was that she had had a heart attack. Oesophageal pain can be almost identical in its symptoms to cardiac pain. However, you cannot prove oesophageal pain and so he said that he would treat her as if she had had a heart attack until he had excluded it.		He would have admitted her, doing serial ECGs and enzyme level tests. The steps that Dr R took after examining her were appropriate. In particular, it was appropriate to order a later ECG. A normal ECG on admission would not exclude a heart attack but if it had happened, it would show on later ECGs.		The deceased should not have been discharged home on the basis of her chest pain having settled by the time of her admission and the ECGs taken at about that time being normal. That would not have been reasonable, because by that time there was no evidence that her pain was not cardiac in origin. It was essential to do serial ECGs. It would have been negligent not to have done the second ECG, the one done at about midday. Dr Woods accepted that, as a 35 year old woman, the deceased was in a very low risk category for a heart attack and he accepted that chest pain is a common medical emergency.		With symptoms which were text book of cardiac pain, albeit of oesophageal pain also, no patient should be discharged until cardiac pain had been excluded. This meant that a large number of patients had to be kept in hospital overnight, although not necessarily in the Coronary Care Unit. With advances since 1991, however, enzymes which peak earlier are used for these tests now and so it is possible to turn patients around more quickly.		The changes in the T-waves on leads V1, V2 and V3 on the ECG trace taken at midday represented a definite change. They were not diagnostic of a cardiac problem but were not due to postural changes on the part of the patient or the positioning of the leads. They could have been due to other non-cardiac causes but on balance would have reinforced his inclination that the problem was cardiac. In any event, there was enough to warrant looking at the matter further. He would therefore have done further ECGs.		The changes in the ECG at midday would have made him more interested in the enzyme levels. Since the AAT enzyme would peak at 12-24 hours after any heart attack (sooner than LDH), that would mean that it should be measured from a blood sample taken not less than 12 hours after the suspected heart attack. That would have meant that the deceased should have been kept in hospital until at least 8.00 p.m. on 12 June for the blood sample to be taken and then some time after that to await the result. The deceased should not have been sent home before the results of these enzyme tests were known.		He was highly critical of Dr J's decision to send her home when he did. He interpreted Dr J's diagnosis of oesophageal spasm as implying that he had excluded a cardiac cause of the problem. But in his view it certainly had not been excluded. If Dr J had seen the trace of the ECG done at midday he had either failed to observe the change or missed its significance.

It serves a large geographical area in respect of serious heart disease and is the only one in the area to do so. In 1991 there were only 11 beds for acute cardiology patients in the CCU. There were a further 34 beds for chronic cardiology patients. There was always pressure on these beds. The system which operated in 1991 was not to have all these acute beds occupied all the time because space had to be kept for the admission of new acute patients. Nor was it possible to admit all patients with chest pain. The frequency of chest pain was too great to allow that.		Symptoms had to be stratified in such a way to decide which patients should be admitted to the CCU and which not. That is because the decision to admit initially was the general practitioner's and the hospital had no choice in the matter at that stage.		Dr J accepted that occasionally wrong decisions were made in deciding which patients to keep in hospital but the published results showed that 95% of them were correct. With regard to the deceased he remembered the situation clearly. That was because he was shocked when she died and he had looked back over what had taken place. He had seen the deceased once. While he was heavily committed during the day with other duties he was always available if necessary but there had been no request for his attendance before his ward round. He also saw and considered the ECG traces taken on admission and at midday. He recognised that there was a change in the latter. These, however, were slight in his view and could be due to many causes, only one of which was cardiac disease. They were not compatible with acute myocardial infarction.		It was true that they increased the likelihood of a cardiac event taking place but that was heavily outweighed by the fact that a woman of the deceased's age was so unlikely to have coronary disease. All this took place before Dr J examined the deceased. He then saw the patient. He took a history from her and examined her. At that time she was no more concerned than most people in her situation and she seemed well. She conversed with him in an articulate way. Her vital signs - pulse and blood pressure - were normal.		Dr J said that if he had thought there was a likelihood of the deceased having cardiac disease, he would not have discharged her at that time. He was at complete variance with the view expressed that the deceased should not have been discharged until a cardiac origin for her chest pain had been excluded, if by that was meant exclusion by serial ECGs and enzyme tests.		He said one had to take account of available capacity in the hospital. It was different from other big cities where there was more than one hospital in the area with a coronary care unit. In his hospital if the patient was very unlikely to have a cardiac problem, the case could not be managed on the basis that that unlikely event might materialise.		There must be regard to available resources. Socio-economic factors had also to be taken into account, particularly when in most cases it would be wholly unnecessary to keep the patient in hospital. In any event, in his own mind and using his clinical judgment he thought he had excluded a cardiac origin for the pain.		It was impractical to admit or keep in hospital all patients with chest pain who have a low probability of coronary artery disease as a cause of their symptoms.		He said that expert witnesses now had the benefit of hindsight which of course he did not have. He also made the point that experts did not see the deceased in the Coronary Care Unit and so had not been able to bring his clinical judgment to bear. Dr J thought that was crucial, adding that otherwise one would practice medicine by telephone or e-mail.		(further evidence to follow)		kirked-7g8htlvldm7vd05fda7zrid68ad76ad53ad7nd27a8a

It receives patients both from its local area and also from elsewhere in the country and on occasions from abroad. He doubted that there was a "normal" practice in 1991 as to whether patients with chest pain should be admitted and kept in hospital. It was impractical to admit and keep in hospital all such patients. For example, at his hospital about 6,000 patients per annum present with suspected cardiac pain. It would be impossible to retain them all in hospital. It was necessary, therefore, to decide who was likely in fact to have cardiac pain.		In 1991 there were three publications which reported that half of all hospital presentations with chest pain were not admitted. Given the deceased's age and gender she was at low risk of cardiac problems. A strong family history of ischaemic heart disease and smoking were risk factors but were not very specific. About 40% would give a similar family history and in 1991 a third of women of that age were smokers. But a large number of people with a similar history would not go on to have a heart attack.		Professor Foot thought that it was extremely unlikely that the deceased had had a heart attack on the morning of 12 June. It was very unusual for a person to have a heart attack and at the same time to have remitting pain and a normal ECG. Moreover, there was no history of sweating, no pallor, the pulse was not substantially elevated and blood pressure was normal. There was also no history of pain on exertion. That was unusual in a person who had underlying heart disease.		We now know that the deceased did in fact have extensive heart disease and in retrospect he thought that what the deceased had that morning was unstable angina, although the symptoms were the same as for pain of a non-cardiac origin.		Not only was he of the view that the deceased's symptoms indicated that it was unlikely that she had had a heart attack on the morning of 12 June, but the fact that the ECG was normal on admission and the chest pain was resolving argued strongly against an evolving heart attack. They did not exclude it but made it highly unlikely.		Only 2-3% of those who had an evolving heart attack would have an entirely normal initial ECG. He agreed that it would not have been unreasonable to consider discharging the deceased at that stage. He added that in North America, where there are greater resources, more patients would be retained but a significant proportion would still be sent home. With regard to Dr Woods view that the patient should be kept in hospital until a cardiac origin for the chest pain had been scientifically excluded, that is, for about 24 hours, he said that that was a statement of the ideal but was not consistent with United Kingdom practice.		Although there were changes in the T-waves in three of the leads, they were not diagnostic of a cardiac condition. They could be due to that but could be due other causes. They were non-specific. They are part of the evidence which consisted of all investigations performed and the clinical assessment. The latter was the most important element. He did not agree with Dr Moon's view that it would have been normal practice in light of the changes in the ECG to have monitored the deceased in the Coronary Care Unit as well as repeating the ECGs and the enzyme tests. That, he thought, was a statement of the ideal but in 1991 it was common for people showing inversion of the T-waves to be discharged from hospital after having presented with chest pain. He was therefore of the view that Dr J was not negligent in discharging the deceased when he did.		Judgement of the Court to follow.		kirked-g52h7fmrd32cd39bd0vd94ad94d00agb

No tissue infarction has yet occurred because the coronary artery has not yet completely occluded but may well do so soon if not treated quickly.	Whilst many aspects of management of ST elevation infarction have improved hugely in the 24 years since your case, many problems remain for similar patients to the one discussed. I would say first that none of my comments represent throwing stones as one correspondent remarked about an earlier case. Rather that, the greatest importance of these cases is not whether or not the court decides about something called negligence but why things go wrong and what might prevent similar mistakes by others. There seem to be three processes that lead to error.		Clinical reasoning: The first challenge with acute chest pain is to decide, clinically, whether the pain is caused by myocardial ischaemia or whether there are positive features to suggest other causes. Here there were clearly symptoms that suggested a high probability for myocardial ischaemia and they convinced the clinicians to take the right initial steps in management. Having decided, reasonably, that myocardial infarction had not occurred, the reasoning process then seemed to go awry. The thinking then changed to there being a low probability of ischaemic heart disease and yet nothing had changed this probability, only that it hadnt yet caused infarction. Suddenly deciding that the pain was due to oesophageal spasm has no justification other than the need to put something on the discharge note.	External factors: The intense pressures to free beds can cause clinicians to reason in different ways and to assess risk differently, even though they usually dont know whether the next patient competing for the bed will have greater or lesser need. Here there were known to be inadequate numbers of beds and clinicians should not to be bullied into accepting policies that could be dangerous. Clinicians may not be able to force better decisions but not, at least, to register concerns can mean that those who should later accept responsibility for harm can claim clinicians agreed with the policy.	Guidelines: While good guidelines can have great value they are too often ineffective or worse because of their poor presentation and the ways in which they are misunderstood or misused. Im not sure what guidelines for NSTEMI patients were in use at that hospital at that time. The challenge is to decide which patients should undergo urgent cardiac catheterisation and which could go home without that investigation. Adam Timmis has just recently written a helpful BMJ article on managing patients with acute coronary syndrome. The decision about urgent catheterisation in NSTEMI patients now depends on the GRACE score which purports to tell the risk of death within the next six months. We dont have precise data to calculate the risk for this patient but its likely she would have shown below the 3% threshold for intervention (yet she died). Some of the rapid responses mention some specific problems with this calculator. My additional concern is that clinical experience/intuition/judgement (mindlines) shouldnt be thrown aside if guidelines dont seem right for a particular context.-133ga36bvg6bwmrgxe1hvfua6uwa6j8ioa9oqd1gte8gng7cu51775m53ab2bilmdu3a64arcymrxonxc3c0oja9a675fgtd

Posted by Maxim	Maxim,		Many thanks for your very helpful analysis and I very much concur with you. I do have some sympathy with Dr J regarding constant pressure to free up beds but his professional duty was to to what is best for his patient and keeping her in hospital might well have kept her alive. He did seem to settle for Oesophageal spasm a little too easily despite little positive evidence.		The Judge said the following in his judgement:		'There is no doubt now that unfortunately the chest pain which the deceased had on the morning of 12 June 1991 was cardiac in origin. The evidence was all one way on that. If that had been known at the time or thought to be the position, then of course Dr J would not have discharged her when he did. But the issue which I have to decide is not whether Dr J was mistaken in discharging her at that time. The issue I have to decide is whether he was negligent in doing so. The two concepts are different. A mistake may, or may not, be negligent. Whether it is negligent depends upon whether it satisfies the legal test for negligence :	"In the realm of diagnosis and treatment there is ample scope for genuine difference of opinion and one man clearly is not negligent merely because his conclusion differs from that of other professional men. ... The true test for establishing negligence in diagnosis or treatment on the part of a doctor is whether he has been proved to be guilty of such failure as no doctor of ordinary skill would be guilty of if acting with ordinary care."		'In the present case Dr J did profess a special skill. He was a consultant cardiologist. His actions therefore have to be tested against those of a consultant cardiologist of ordinary skill acting with ordinary care. To assist me in deciding this matter I was favoured with the evidence of three distinguished independent consultant cardiologists and of Dr J himself, who is also a distinguished consultant cardiologist. Before dealing with that evidence, however, it is important to remember that Dr J's actions can only be judged on the basis of the information that he had. That may be a statement of the obvious but it can easily be lost sight of when the information that he had was different from the information that others had or may have had. In this case he had, in particular, the information contained in the notes made by Dr R when he saw and examined the deceased on her admission to the Coronary Care Unit. He also had the ECGs taken at 8.53 a.m. and at about midday. And he had his own clinical assessment. There was no dispute among the experts that that was most important. He did not have any letter from the general practitioner. Moreover, there is no evidence that he had any information communicated over the telephone by the general practitioner or any information from members of the family which was additional to or different from that recorded by Dr R.		Having come to this view in relation to the evidence of the independent experts and, in particular, of Professor Foot, it follows that the plaintiffs have failed to pass the test in Hunter v Hanley. In light of his evidence I am unable to hold that in discharging the deceased when he did, Dr J "has been proved to be guilty of such failure as no doctor of ordinary skill would be guilty of if acting with ordinary care"..............I have already said something about the way Dr J gave his evidence. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for me to say a little more. He was naturally in an unenviable position. As it turned out, his decision to discharge the deceased was plainly wrong and it led to the deceased's death. Naturally he felt that keenly. The subsequent Fatal Accident Inquiry and this action could only have exacerbated that. Nevertheless, having seen him and heard him give evidence I was left with the clear impression of a careful and very caring doctor who took his heavy responsibilities with all the seriousness that they require. Of course, the death of the deceased must have been a terrible shock for the pursuers and the rest of the family and it is a tragedy for them all. It was natural in the circumstances for Dr J's decision to discharge her to have been questioned but I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence that I heard at the proof that that decision was not a negligent one.'		Finally, I am curious about the Post Mortem findings. Is it common that a patient with such severe CAD has no signs or symptoms (eg Angina) other than when she presents acutely with an MI? (Remember I am a layman!)		Kirked		PS. I was not familiar with the Grace score but looked it up and NICE say that it is very well evidenced and robust. Is your own impression that it is not so convincing?-i39sa36bvg6bwmrgxe1hvfua6uwa6j8ioa9oqd1gte8gng7ctie4a39ad6cx7bmad9vla6q9nk9ar4bkgma4j1642841a53ab2bilv8nfra64arcymrxonxc3c0oja9a377spoh

Although it is indeed easy to be wise in hindsight, this rigorous process of analysis after things go wrong is what reflective practice is really about(and not some armchair navel-gazing).These cases should be highly prized by practicing clinicians because it has to be better to learn lessons from someone else's mistakes than to to wait until you repeat them yourself. To address a few points.	1) It's not at all unusual to find post-mortem evidence of severe CAD when there had been no known symptoms in life. Even pastmyocardial infarctions may have gone unnoticed (or at least unrecognised).	2) My point about the GRACE score is that it almost certainly would have shown this patient to be at much lower risk than the threshold for intervention. In part this related to the important points made by Shane and Quachee that presentation of CAD can be very different in young, particularly female patients, to the 'typical' picture in older people. Also it doesn't include risk factors and considers only that genericsubset of patients who don't fit criteria for revascularisation of STEMI.	3) I'm glad that Dr J was not judged to be negligent but it seems ironic that the decisions he made were not those that differed from peers. This presumably means that such a patient remains at special risk wherever treated. It's also worth noting that Dr J probably acted in accordance with evencurrent guidelines and that is further cause for concern. Where I might question the judgement is that it was the very pressure of freeing beds that probably changed the clinical thinking and decision-making.	4) I have every sympathy with doctors who cut corners and take risks because of other pressures such as freeing beds. I've been there myself and know how difficult it is to be completely objective. It's a subject that has not been adequatelyaddressed by the profession. My one wish would be that those who suggest cutting bed numbers be honest and admit that the plan comes with risks, not pretend that 'efficiencies', community care,'new ways of working'or other suchnonsenses negate the risks. Even worse is the practice of twisting clinicians's arms to collude in the fiction. This is exactly what happened in Psychiatry and it's all gone horribly (and predictably)wrong. We now hear that Lord David Prior is hinting at the need to cut many NHShospital beds. I hope all conflicts of interest will be adequatelyconsidered as in published research.-ir9dwnyojc3l6csdxcvjterd0b2a9nvan1a8f9dg7eo6c

Posted by Maxim	Many thanks Maxim for taking the time and trouble to contribute so much to this case analysis. I wish more Doctors would contribute because - as you say - there is the luxury of learning from other people's mistakes. Also, I try to select cases which do have some specific points which can be helpful for future practice. I recognise that the cases can be lengthy and may be off putting but again I deliberately want them to be more detailed than those in Defence journals. There should be enough information to enable the reader to have the salient facts but not saturated with extraneous information. This thread has had 437 views so people have looked at it but perhaps not wished to contribute for whatever reason. Perhaps I should consider a different style or some other different way of presenting the cases. As regards your points:	1) many thanks, understood	2) I understand. Important points	3) yes. Bed pressure is at the heart of poor decision making here	4) there will be more of this in the future	Once again I appreciate your perspectives.

You're right about my background. I was lucky enough to learn from and work with some of theUKs bestclinicians and teachers in the 60's and 70's. I was encouragedto beinvolved in innovative medical education early on and decided to develop this throughout my career. I would have liked to help introduce more rigorous real-time analyses of clinical case histories but I ran out of time and it is very difficult nowadays to change curricula. The classic clinico-pathology conferences are rather rare these days and too much of what passes for education and assessmentis inbrief 'sound-bites' and one word answers to MCQs that don't develop critical thinking.	I hope you can continue your style of case presentations as the interest is there even if few peoplehave feltable to commit.Yes,thescripts are complex andrequire effort but that's what goodclinical medicine involves. The defence societies do a good job in educating about the law but it's good to have something that goes beyond justthe avoidance of compaints to dissect why things happen.

You're right about my background. I was lucky enough to learn from and work with some of theUKs bestclinicians and teachers in the 60's and 70's. I was encouragedto beinvolved in innovative medical education early on and decided to develop this throughout my career. I would have liked to help introduce more rigorous real-time analyses of clinical case histories but I ran out of time and it is very difficult nowadays to change curricula. The classic clinico-pathology conferences are rather rare these days and too much of what passes for education and assessmentis inbrief 'sound-bites' and one word answers to MCQs that don't develop critical thinking.	I hope you can continue your style of case presentations as the interest is there even if few peoplehave feltable to commit.Yes,thescripts are complex andrequire effort but that's what goodclinical medicine involves. The defence societies do a good job in educating about the law but it's good to have something that goes beyond justthe avoidance of compaints to dissect why things happen.

Odysseus	Posted by Odysseus	Odysseus,	Many thanks for your very valid questions and comments.'May I suggest if you are going to post long mediicolegal cases that you use more recent cases and not ones newly a quarter of a century ago before some on this site were born'	I generally vary the case reports from pretty recently to some going back many years. In this particular case I chose it because sadly the issues it raises are still of concern today. Namely, clinical decisions being influenced by resource problems. Also, when Doctors comment it is important to remember that clinical knowledge has progressed significantly since then and the reader must factor that in. That in itself can be an important lesson.	'n future, Kirked your long posts would be easier to read if you were to have headings or guide posts to aid readers. Perhaps fewer notes, Mozart'	This is a very important point you make and I accept it. I have long wondered how best to present the cases. Judgements are invariably very long and of course for some it is very off putting. When the case is placed on d2d I have already trimmed it down significantly but it can still remain very long. On the next case I will be experimenting with a new way of presenting it. Perhaps more headings and a timeline. Perhaps questions periodically.	Your other comments about retaking the history etc are essential and should never be forgotten.	Thankyou for taking the time to contribute.	kirked-yo6evn6c1a0ezc3irgyf30d

She consulted her own GP regarding hot facial flushes, night sweats. palpitations, irritability and mood swings. She suspected it was the Menopause and her GP agreed. The GP did not carry out any physical examination or check any vital parameters. She was started on HRT and did not need to consult the GP again for about 8 months - she automatically requested refills of prescriptions as needed. When she did return to her GP she explained that the symptoms were better since being on HRT but not eradicated. She also stated that over the last few weeks she had periodical intense headaches and anxiety which seemed to coincide with the hot flushes.		The GP changed the medication regime slightly and advised her to return if symptoms did not settle and they might consider other options. A week after seeing her Miss Z was taken unwell whilst at work. She explained to the Paramedics what treatment she was on (HRT only) and that she had noted her BP was high on several occasions (using her own sphygmomanometer) when she was flushed. Her BP on assessment in A&E by an SpR noted a BP of 190/115 but other parameters were all normal.		Twenty four hours after admission to hospital her BP was fluctuating between 190/115 and 210/110 but all other Parameters were considered within normal ranges. On day 3 of admission she suffered a severe haemorrhagic stroke which required intensive nursing and physiotherapy to achieve even a minimal level of independence.		It subsequently transpired she had Phaeochromocytoma which would have explained several of her symptoms. Miss Z felt very let down by her GP and hospital Doctor whom she felt should have considered Phaeo and might, therefore have prevented the stroke.		She sued her GP and the hospital.

Doctors as patients can affect care in different ways. It doesnt sound as if the right diagnosis occurred to the patient and her suggestion of the menopause as a diagnosis might have been accepted too easily.	Looking more closely at what lessons this case might offer, I will admit a slight interest in phaeochromocytomas. In training I spent several years on a unit where blood pressure was a major interest. As a consultant physician (not with particular BP interest) I diagnosed four patients with phaeos in time to allow successful surgery and saw one other patient, a very young man, who presented in extremis with acute heart failure secondary to extensive subendocardial infarction and who died before the diagnostic biochemical tests returned. This is an unusual number of patients for one consultant to see in a working lifetime but I dont know how much was chance and how much increased awareness.	When a rare diagnosis is missed and legal proceedings occur I guess the Bolam principle is a consideration. Unfortunately we often dont know what a body of our peers would do (as opposed to what they might say in retrospect) in any given circumstances. Most expert witnesses probably dont constitute typical peers. The general argument sometimes put forward in defence is that most doctors might never see more than one phaeo (or other rare condition) in a working lifetime. How many are missed is another question and I think most phaeos are still diagnosed post-mortem.	The point about rarity and recognition is understandable but problematic. It might suggest that we could never be expected to diagnose conditions we have never seen but that would be ridiculous. There are many rare diseases or those occurring in very unusual contexts that defy the best clinicians but rare things do occur and missing some can be fatal. Any diagnosis is easy once youve thought of it. The challenge in clinical reasoning (a subject still formally taught in only a very few medical schools) is to give yourself the best chance to think of it. 	The process of diagnosis involves comparing the illness script with the usual scripts of the most important candidate conditions (not just the first one to come to mind). Distinctive clusters of symptoms can act as mental prompts. The combination of headaches, sweating and palpitations in attacks is highly suggestive of phaeo even if the blood pressure is unremarkable outside attacks. Many patients also report funny turns or odd feelings that can defy explanation. Flushing is actually not that common. Perhaps the most important single technique to avoid missing things is, when you think you have the diagnosis, to ask could this be anything else?	As youve shown us, the legal discussions in these cases are often very searching and its a shame when valuable lessons learned dont link back into mandatory learning for others (as weve discussed with civil aviation). The defence society journals do this quite well but I suspect the lessons are read only by a minority of doctors.-ow9flaka6x1j5ctr8i7eqc3t8d2gxb1kba8o8bwja5fub52a776582gw7awuvnr3a2c59aggyfye2yufnr3h1czb3c080eyld

Some diagnoses require time for a decent history and time for the clinician to think and reflect. Clinicians don't have this time and so diagnoses frequently seem to get dumbed down to the 'most likey' without any consideration of a differential. Increasing use of NPs and HCAs may (or may not) exacerbate this - without a medical degree how can rare things be considered?	There are well documented examples of persistent late diagnoses for unusual conditions such as MS and SLE for these reasons.	In this case obviously the BP should have been measured and this makes it indefensible. But it's possible it may have been normal/high normal at the time of measurement. The clues were in the history but it would have taken time and an interest to elicit them.-

The defence society journals do this quite well but I suspect the lessons are read only by a minority of doctors.Posted by Maxim	Maxim, you identify important points of discussion here - expert witnesses, rare diagnosis and Bolam. If I may firstly say something on expert witnesses.		When selecting an expert witness the plaintiff needs someone who will support their case and say the defendant standard of care was poor. The expert knows this (although it is unlikely to be explicitly stated). If he is to be used at all (and receive his fee) he must provide such a report. I do not suggest for one moment that all experts are simply lying so they can enjoy a healthy income from being an expert but it is naive to believe that all experts are thoroughly neutral and provide reports for the benefit of the court (which is actually what they are supposed to do).		The fact that expert peer review of a case is necessarily retrospective is rarely given adequate recognition in the litigation process, even though judges occasionally refer to the aspect of hindsight. Doctors have long been aware of the pitfalls of the "retrospectoscope", but it is not generally known that considerable scientific evidence indicates that hindsight bias is inevitable when a reviewer is aware of an adverse outcome. Hindsight bias ensures that some reasonably acting defendants will be unfairly subjected to adverse liability judgments.		Hindsight bias has been recognised by psychologists for decades, and has been studied more recently by investigators interested in quality assurance in healthcare. In one study, anaesthetist reviewers were provided with sets of cases with the same descriptive facts, but with outcomes randomly assigned to be either bad or neutral. The anaesthetists consistently rated the care in cases with bad outcomes as substandard, whereas they viewed identical care with neutral outcomes as being up to standard. The degree of bias is linked to the severity of the outcome  with severely injured patients, judgements by reviewers tend to be harsher. When reviewers know of an adverse outcome, they tend to trivialise the management dilemmas facing the doctor at the time, overlooking the uncertainties inherent in diagnosis and treatment. Expert opinions frequently include the phrase "it should have been obvious". It has been suggested that hindsight bias is almost always present when that expression is used. Another approach might be to use a "neutral" expert or panel to evaluate the appropriateness of decisions by a clinician in a given situation. Hindsight bias can be diminished by withholding information about the outcome of the case. If the expert is not assessing the case accurately and impartially from the outset it is difficult for the right lessons to be learned from it. Legal cases are adversarial. One very experienced Judge from Australia expressed how he sees the process in action:		'[They] ... assume that the expert witness is there to help the court. They do not recognise the practicalities of litigation under the adversarial system. Under that system, all evidence is selective, and it is selected on the basis of what will help the party to win, not on the basis of whether it will help the court to find the facts correctly. Indeed, the reliability of expert evidence is antipathetical to the interests of the litigant except where reliability and interest coincide by accident. Under the adversarial system, the opposing party is relied upon to disclose the falsity of the other sides evidence by cross-examination or evidence to the opposite effect. That sometimes happens but it may not happen, particularly when the other sides case is just as extravagant in the opposite direction. The actual role of the expert witness, particularly in major litigation, is that the expert is part of the team. He  it usually is a he  contributes to the way the case is framed and indirectly to decisions as to what evidence is to be got in to provide a basis for his opinion. His report is honed in consultation with counsel. Then, when it comes to the trial, he is a front line soldier, carrying his sides argument on the technical issues under the fire of cross-examination. Natural selection ensures that expert witnesses will serve the interests of their clients in this way. If the expert measures up he will be kept on and he will be used again by the same client, the same solicitors and others. If he does not measure up, he will be dropped from the case or never used again by anyone. He then disappears from the forensic scene'.		Another manifestation of hindsight bias is what Dekker describes as micro-matching  assessing performance after-the-fact by holding it up against a world you now know to be true. Medical expert reviewers frequently do this in reports by citing (sometimes out of context) published protocols or guidelines for managing a particular clinical condition and comparing them with the defendant doctors actions in order to construct negligence.		The application of protocols and guidelines in medical negligence cases is fraught with difficulties. Guidelines that are comprehensive, workable and up-to-date are readily available for only a few selected clinical conditions. Even so, to assume that clinical guidelines can be mapped one-on-one onto clinical situations is premised on a deeply flawed model of the relationship between written protocol and actual practice. There is always a gap between the two. Guidelines cannot dictate their own application. The coding in guidelines for the implicit normative standard against which real performance is contrasted is either underspecified (too vague to use for evaluation) or overspecified (citing the exact situation in which to apply them, which will almost never be the precise one confronting the clinician).

Several high profile cases have highlighted this problem. The Cleveland case, which occurred in the late 1980s resulted in 121 young children being placed in care as the result of the erroneous diagnosis of sexual abuse made on the basis of very dubious physical evidence determined to be pathognomonic of such maltreatment. Two paediatricians, Drs Marietta Higgs and Geoffrey Wyatt, had determined that, when examining the children, reflex anal dilatation proved the diagnosis of abuse; in fact it is relatively common amongst unabused children as research has revealed. Their controversial diagnoses resulted in the children being taken into care, contributing to the emotional trauma they had already experienced as a result of the examination and the manner in which they were treated by the doctors who in most cases failed to call the children by their first names or explain what they were doing. Perhaps most distressing is the manner in which the children were taken.	A total of 2007 people were affected by the scandal that dominated the news and media; the doctors continued in clinical practice and the children are still suffering the long term consequences. Many describe their treatment at the hands of the so-called medical experts as sexual abuse And many are still suffering the long term effects of such treatment. Yet neither of the doctors has ever been questioned in a criminal investigation. Considering also the case of Sally Clark , another who suffered tragic consequences at the hands of the medical profession. The unfortunate woman was convicted of the murder of her two young sons on the basis of medical evidence submitted to court by self-proclaimed expert medical witnesses. Her first son died suddenly at the age of 12 weeks in 1996; her second son died at the age of 8 weeks just 2 years later. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or, colloquially, cot death is a well-recognised clinical entity and thankfully comparatively rare, resulting in the death of about 300 babies every year. There are several risk factors associated with the syndrome, namely prematurity, low birth weight and male sex; Harry was premature thereby qualifying for two of the risk factors. The 'medical experts' held the view that lightning could not strike twice in the same family and, apparently lacking sufficient evidence to ascertain the causes of death, decided that the children must have been smothered. Principally the paediatrician, Professor Meadow, was of the latter opinion; he attributed the chances of two children succumbing to cot death in the same well-to-do family as 1:73,000,000. The true figure is actually around 1:200. It is small comfort that he was subsequently discredited as his belief in his own expertise destroyed families; units not easily mended. As a result of this somewhat flawed medical evidence, Sally Clark was tried for murder, convicted and jailed. She spent 4 years behind bars before her case came before the Court of Appeal. A similar case was that of Trupti Patel who was convicted of the murder of her three young children, but she too was subsequently acquitted on appeal. A lot of cases involved Professor Meadows whose firmly held beliefs caused much damage to the families involved.	At appeal it transpired that the pathologist involved in the case had withheld evidencethat one of the Clark boys had an infection which could have contributed to his death. He had also just received the controversial combined vaccination routinely given at two months of age. The pathologist was also found to have acted beyond his competence. His behaviour, coupled with that of the eminent paediatrician, resulted in a gross miscarriage of justice. The doctors arrogance beggars belief and, although the paediatrician was struck off by the General Medical Council, he was reinstated as the judge felt that he had acted in good faith. This latter point illustrates the problem that the judiciary face in judging the medical profession and their expertise. There are inherent problems in the concept of the expert witness; not only can their expertise be questionable but time must also be factored into a situation. After the misadventure which is to be debated in court, the passage of time may well have determined the true risks associated with a new procedure; how then does the expert reconcile events of the past with new knowledge unavailable at the time an incident occurred? Lord Dennings famous 1947/1954 spectacles; 'we must not look at a 1947 case with 1954 spectacles'. In practice, this can be difficult to do.	kirked-ch0kx9c6q1cxd75anst30685jgubamb7zvsq1ajhwgxkpnzgn1e3a69airs1afcujvhukxd

Posted by sken	Many thanks sken, I agree with your point:'Patient at fault (sorry , I know the patient is never at fault in the NHS almost by defiition) for apparently checking her BP and not reporting . I would not give this failure any legal significance'	It certainly seems nowadays that patients or consumers can do no wrong. Every time something goes wrong or an outcome is less dramatic than anticipated there must be someone at fault. Sadly the legal profession is almost totally responsible for this blame culture and legal cases will be undertaken against any organisation or emanation of the state because it has deep pockets. We have not reached the suing culture of the US yet (we are not even close even if it doesn't seem the case) but specialist Solicitors are popping up whenever a mass tort is on the cards.	In this case the patient did not succeed in her legal action.	kirked-zx8eu2d

I note that Dr.Joanne Liu, the President of MSF, is quoted, questioninghow the recommendations would translate to real action on the ground."We have seen so many reports calling for change, with everyone focused on how to improve future response and meanwhile, with 20-25 new Ebola cases per week in the region, we still don`t have the current epidemic under control. On Ebola, we went from global indifference, to global fear, to global response and now to global fatigue. We must finish the job," she said.	It was MSF that led the fight against Ebola before the WHO took notice, that was the agency that brought the epidemic to their attention and was the authority that was consulted when the UN wanted to kick backsides into action.   It might be said that MSF should assume this role, but I doubt they would want to take it on.	John-pyww0bb

In addition, one quarter of survivors are dealing with eye problems  if the virus infects the eye, it can persist there for months, leading to uveitis, cataracts, and in extreme cases, blindness. Again, clinicians can only treat the symptoms until the patient's immune system naturally clears the virus from the eye.Headache, extreme fatigue, and depression are also being reported frequently."It is increasingly clear that emerging from an [Ebola treatment unit] is just the beginning," the WHO's Anders Nordstrom said.WHO press briefing (audio)(Free)WHO news release(Free)New York Timesstory(Free)-b62axa7t50ayawf5321f5l156b

I have just been amending my advance decision in trying to cover possible ITU treatment . As one grows older the recovery time is likely to be a greater percentage of remaining life. Currently I am refusing treatment if there is less than a 75% chance of recovery to relative independence based on overall figures - as in these diagrams - not on individual possibilities. Give me another few years and I will probably refuse (and in some hospitals be refused ) ITU treatment altogether. As I set off again towards mosquito territory I had wondered about including a refusal of ventilation for Guillain Barre - but should be able to do that at the time. I would just need to be in a hospital where this would be permitted and the staff prepared to give palliative care. Memories of Miss B Our local ITU had some excellent folk who at one time kept a list of people who had an AD so there was at least a useful starting point for discussion.	I am not alone in these opinions and wondered whether this type of diagram was ever used in discussion with patients and families. It would be a step further from the cruder assessments used in the past and covers so much more than mere survival.-

Some have questioned how much these rankings really matter except to the business success of Universities.	The controversy might prompt us to look at the way UK medical schools are ranked and in what ways the rankings might or might not have any use. In a recent Student BMJ article Richard Wakeford has taken a critical look at some of the problems of ranking medical schools and how different guides use different criteria and so give different rankings for the same schools.	Student BMJ 2015;23:h1359	Wakeford suggests that prospective students choosing a school might do better to consult a new GMC database that ranks schools by markers of later career progress. The comparison, for example using pass rates for all major postgraduate exams, gives rather different ranking to the conventional ones.	Prospective medical students choose a medical school for all sorts of reasons. Social factors can be important for some. Some prefer to study a more traditional curriculum, others might choose a problem-based or integrated course. The measurable differences in outcome seem to be small but even with the GMC database we still dont know how to assess and compare the quality of doctors produced. Quality of teaching can be highly variable and difficult to gauge in advance; it is usually represented by student questionnaire result but we lack good measures of face-to face teaching quality.	One factor not included in any rankings is the quality of experience gained in the clinical institutions linked to each medical school. Recent events in Cambridge have highlighted the difficulties involved in making these judgements but, arguably, it is the clinical experience that might matter most in choosing where to study.	What do doc2doc members think of medical school rankings?	 Are they genuinely useful in making informed choices about where to study or are they of more useful in attracting funding for schools?	This topic doesnt seem to lend itself easily to a traditional doc2doc poll.-6q7d5htjoi3griqb0hrh3fyh5j5ez69546fqtaj9cqtg1axy

The dominance of English tends to marginalise the rest of the world.	Even scientific papers tend to English as anglophone journals have the highest Impact Factors.	It is an uneven playing field.	We don't rank graduates in terms of their overall competence and compassion. Do we?	As for Australia, we haven't spoken English for years.	Odysseus-td2a6mmbya03a2b

When choosing a medical school for clinical training I well remember asking around about the differences. University rankings seem to relate predominantly to academic prowess but that may not be the most relevant for the student. The London was my top choice because of its reputation for offering a wealth of clinical experience and and an emphasis on straight clinical teaching and experience. The then UCH was seen as having a much more academic emphasis , St T's for those where "social awareness" was important and St M's for those wishing to continue with sporting ambitions etc... All these , and other , stereotypes of course will change over the years but in retrospect (for my rough contemporaries ) the stereotypes of my time seem to have been borne out.	So on grapevine knowledge , I suspect I might have made a similar choice to Odysseus. Of course basic academic standards are also relevant and I did not consider those where I felt this might be somewhat lacking. Perhaps there could be a place for mission statements - something I usually abhor - and the London motto was OK in this respect.	I suspect a bigger factor in choosing a medical school could be how readilly openings are available to jobs in that catchment area. Where would be my current bias - could well be Nottingham on what I have read and heard.	PS My wife (and brother) chose UCH.....-gn3btc77bzq4a

There seems to be a strong thread of educationalists in medicine who seek to train our successors in the finer things, in particular compassion and empathy.  If you will go to "Hektoen International, the journal of Medical Humanities" you will find the evidence. In particular an article on using a Verdi opera ( I  Lombardi), and the Velasques painting "Las. Meninas" as object lessons in teaching is most interesting.  I don't know where the authors, Schidlow and Gelo are based.	I can't offer a link as I'm posting from my iPhone but search for "heltoeninternational.org"	John-1fqh2n8d8asb8hvcr
