The only answer is a dental implant. And what could be better than a dental implant? The natural tooth. But can a dental implant be as perfect as a natural tooth? Yes, it certainly can be.

A dental implant helps to maintain the facial structure and prevents bone deterioration that can happen when a tooth is absent or missing.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Types of dental implants<br /><br />> Crown, a single prosthesis is used to replace one lost tooth where each prosthesis tooth is attached to its own implant.<br /><br />> Fixed bridge means a partial prosthesis or a complete prosthesis.

A removable prosthesis attaches to a ball or a bar in socket attachments, while a fixed prosthesis is stuck permanently and only a dentist can remove it.<br /><br /> Many patients think that Dentures offer most affordable, low-cost and the best solution. Thus, they prefer to go for it which is not right.

It is common to experience heartburn and acid reflux especially after eating large meal, spicy foods or too much garlic-rich food. The condition is more likely to develop in people who are over weight or pregnant.<br /><br />  <br /><br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /> Prolonged acid reflux, if left untreated, can damage esophageal line or may cause ulcers. This may lead to bleeding or narrowing of esophagus. Moreover, acid reflux is the common cause among most of the people today having serious symptoms of sleep apnea or insomnia.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> So, it is important to deal this condition and prevent the symptoms in the best possible ways.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> One of the best ways to prevent acid reflux condition is raising your sleeping bed either with the bed risers or therapeutic wedge pillows which are commonly available in the market today.<br /><br />  <br /><br />How Can Bed Wedge Pillows help with GERD?<br /><br /> This condition is worse when you lie down at night to rest because gravity works against an individual. If you lay down flat using a standard pillow, there is no gravity that helps to keep stomach acid lower. A bed wedge pillow elevates the head, shoulders and torso slightly and prevents from the reflux condition. When the upper body is elevated, gravity lessens up the chances of the stomach contents to come back up into the esophagus.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A wedge pillow can be used while sleeping on your back or on your side without causing any problems or sprains with your head or neck. Most of the pillows available in the market allow 30 to 45 degrees elevation or 6-8 inches at the top. This is the height, that studies have proved to provide the best results in preventing heartburn throughout the night and have a good night sleep.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> These bed wedge pillows are sturdy and ergonomically designed for acid reflux and GERD.

You will probably need to replace your wedge pillow with another one after using it for several years.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Can I Use My Own Pillows For Relieving Acid Reflux?<br /><br /> There are people who try to pile up their own personal pillows and make a slanting slope, but it might not turn out to be helpful the same way.

11	22	2	Food safety must be a priority	"As the essaytyper expert writers state, the World Health Organization (WHO) encouraged every country in the South-East Asia area to make nourishment security a need. It expressed that more than 700,000 youngsters pass on in the South-East Asia district consistently because of looseness of the bowels and a few different ailments created by the tainted nourishment and water.<br /><br /> ""Microorganisms, infections, parasites, chemicals, and different contaminants in our sustenance can result in more than 200 maladies extending from looseness of the bowels to disease. New and rising dangers, for example, environmental change and its effect on nourishment creation; developing organic and natural defilement - all Apose difficulties to the wellbeing of our sustenance,"" said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, provincial chief, WHO South-East Asia in an announcement.<br /><br /> She said the nations must set up thorough sustenance wellbeing strategies and stringently actualize it over the natural way of life. Food safety has been set as the topic for the forthcoming World Health Day. Khetrapal said sustenance wellbeing is one of the key focus areas under the International Health Regulations - IHR 2005 - which incorporates occasions of all general wellbeing crises of universal worry that include debased nourishment and flare-ups of sustenance borne sicknesses.<br /><br /> She educated that the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have built the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) to quickly impart data amid sustenance security crises. ""WHO bolsters nations to avoid, distinguish and react to sustenance borne ailment flare-ups utilizing the Codex Alimentarius, an accumulation of universal nourishment guidelines, rules and codes of practice.<br /><br /> ""Codex procurements concern the hygienic and dietary nature of nourishment, including microbiological standards, sustenance added substances, pesticides and veterinary medication deposits, contaminants, marking and presentation, and strategies for examining and danger examination - covering all the primary nourishments and procedures,"" she said.<br />Article last time updated on 16.10.2017."

12	28	2	Prescription Compliance and Type II Diabetes Management	The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that adherence to long-term therapies for chronic illnesses (including diabetes) averages less than 50% globally. This means, less than half of the individuals diagnosed with a long-term and life-threatening disease comply with the care instructions provided by their physicians; and several are without access to regular physician and prescription drugs.<br /><br /> Most patients would want to follow the doctor’s advice, take medication, and avoid complications, and compliance continues to be the largest contributing factor to long-term health management for diabetics. If it were as simple as eating fewer carbohydrates and taking medicines regularly, every diabetic’s health would be well-managed with reduced long-term risk factors. Social policies must address the complex psychology and challenges to manage chronic illnesses, particularly diabetes, which experts predict will impact 552 million people globally by 2030.<br /><br />Challenges that Impact Patient Prescription Adherence<br /> With the availability of a variety of medicines and therapies, as well as educational programs geared at helping patients understand the long-term health risks of diabetes, medical compliance is key to reducing risk factors. There are three measurable considerations that impact prescription compliance for diabetic patients.<br /><br />1. Economic<br /> Several medicines are effective in regulating blood glucose, along with lifestyle changes that promote a healthy and consistent Body Mass Index (BMI) score. The most common prescription drug used is Metformin, coupled with other glucose regulators such as Glimepiride (Amaryl).  There are many oral medicines that can be prescribed as part of the oral drug therapy for Type 2 diabetes. Over time, physicians may recommend several companion drugs to achieve glucose-control in the patient.<br /> Some of the newer pharmaceuticals available for Type 2 Diabetics are expensive. The cost of some drugs range from $400 to over $500 per month.  A prescription medical plan may cost a patient about $60 per month in prescription co-pay, but for an individual who does not have a comprehensive medical insurance plan, some of the best alternatives automatically become unaffordable. This can mean trying different affordable medicines in higher dosages, with a greater out-of-pocket expense for the patient.<br /> According to research reviewed in ‘The economic burden of diabetes in India: a review of the literature’ by Charles AK Yesudian, Mari Grepstad, Erica Visintin and Alessandra Ferrario, the cost of patient management in India is rapidly accelerating.<br /><br /> “In 2012, 60% of all deaths in India were due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer and diabetes.” In India, rapid urbanization of culture, increased affluence, and changing fitness and diet habits, combined with increased life expectancy have increased the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for patients to 43%.<br /><br /> Access to supervised therapies, and medication monitoring and testing have had a profound impact on health outcomes, and reduced the risk of complications or secondary chronic disease. Personal economic resources have a tremendous impact on health outcomes for Type II diabetics. Many people without quality insurance benefits try to “go without” the expense of medications and medical supervision for long periods of time to economize, placing their personal health in jeopardy.<br /> In countries such as Canada, Thailand and the UAE where Universal health care is provided to citizens, health complications and medical costs are greatly reduced. This is because patients are assisted with effective management of chronic diseases even before symptoms become life-threatening.<br /><br />2. Quantity and Schedule of Medications<br /><br /> The treatment of diabetes requires that the patient undergoes a dramatic lifestyle change to reduce associated health risks. A few changes that patients find challenging to deal with are the dosage of oral medicines, and supplemental insulin injections or insulin pumps.<br /><br /> Diabetes medication is prescribed along with blood pressure regulators and cholesterol-reducing oral prescriptions. Another complication related to Type 2 diabetes includes thyroid performance, which also requires daily medication.<br /><br /> When you add it up, a diabetic can be taking between four and ten different medicines per day.  Forgetting to take medication is a common problem, and one that makes blood glucose management difficult.3. Emotional Considerations<br /><br /> Patients with Type II diabetes are constantly confronted with terrifying possibilities and health complications, including amputation, painful neuropathy (nerve pain), heart attack, blindness, pancreatic cancer, and kidney malfunction.<br /><br /> While fear mobilizes many people to make dramatic lifestyle changes, including weight loss, diet modification and medication compliance, the overwhelming feeling can turn into anxiety and even depression for others. Mood swings are further complicated by low and high blood glucose, which can dramatically impact energy levels. Many patients remain in a state of denial about Type 2 diabetes, thereby worsening their symptoms by not following the physician’s guidance.<br /><br /> It is estimated that by 2030, 552 million people around the world will be affected by Type I or Type 2 diabetes. The challenge to educate diabetics about the importance of persistent compliance versus personal complacency is essential to prevent health complications, and increased diabetes-related mortality rates worldwide. Social programs should be developed and further improved to support individuals with chronic disease to avoid negative health outcomes in the future.<br /><br />Sources:<br /> ‘The current state of diabetes mellitus in India’.

14	31	2	Little Children and the Places They Put Foreign Objects	"I was teaching medical students last week and urged them to always get a chest X-ray if they were puzzled about a diagnosis. I told them of a favorite three-year-old who was ill. She had seen another doctor who said he didn't hear anything in her chest, so she didn't  have pneumonia. Looking at her breathing I knew the child  had pneumonia and an immediate chest-X-ray proved this to be the case. I then told them about another child who was very croupy and had been seen by two or three doctors. The ""croup"" had lasted for a couple of months and was treated with antibiotics. The cough didn't sound like croup to me. My two children crouped every winter in Rochester, New York, so it was a cough I knew well. I told the parents I wanted to get a chest X-ray and specified that the neck be included. It was fortunate I did because the child had a safety pin in his trachea or windpipe. An excellent ENT doctor removed it that evening and the ""croup"" disappeared.<br /><br /> I have always been amazed at the places where children can put foreign objects, either in their body or in different orifices.  I have removed beads from the ear canal and the nose and a particular smelly piece of bread from up in a child's nose. Another child had a dead insect in his ear canal.  One child had a safety pin her vagina.   So if you see smelly pus coming from an orifice you might want to think about a foreign object.<br />Article last time updated on 12.03.2018."

15	31	2	Beware of Doctors Who Think They are Infallible	"It is always painful to hear accounts of doctors who make statements that are false for which they  have no basis. Yes, there are some great doctors, but there are doctors who must feel they have crystal balls because of some of the things they say. I remember as a little girl meeting the owner of a candy store who had been told, as a young man, that he had just a few months to live. He was diagnosed as having tuberculosis somewhere in the East and decided to move to California. I remember him as a tall, handsome, elderly man with white hair. He had lived for sixty or more years after the time he was supposed to die.<br /><br /> A friend recently told me of the surgeon who operated on her son's brain tumor and announced to the man's wife that it was a very malignant tumor, which would give her husband just six months to live. The man is now doing well two  years later after having had chemotherapy. What was the surgeon thinking? I wonder if he ever apologized, but suspect he did not.<br /><br /> Another doctor called a mother and told her that her son had muscular dystrophy. The single parent mother became hysterical, as you can well understand. The boy did not have muscular dystrophy, but instead had treatable dermatomyosis and later became a professor.<br /><br /> I think medical schools are admitting very bright students who often lack compassion. The ""art of medicine"" is slowly being lost. A doctor should never, ever make statements, particularly by phone,  without being sure they are backed up by positive evidence.<br />Article last time updated on 25.02.2018."

16	31	2	Parenting a Child with Hemophilia	Jennifer Dunaway, the mother of a son with hemophilia, has kindly written the guest post below. My great thanks to her.<br /><br />Coping with a Child's Hemophilia<br /><br /> When I was first told my son had Hemophilia, he was only 9 days old. Every parent wants a healthy, beautiful newborn baby, but that is not guaranteed.  Sometimes you must learn to accept what is given to you, appreciate what you have and make the best of the situation.<br /><br /> After months of denial and finally acceptance, I dove into learning all I could about Hemophilia. Knowledge is power, and I desperately wanted control over the situation. I couldn’t control that he had this disorder, but I could control how I dealt with it.<br /><br /> I became an expert in describing to ER doctors how hemophilia is treated; most did not know. I bought books for my son so he could understand at his level what he had. I reached out to other moms, the local Hemophilia Association,( www.hemophilia.org)  all to gain knowledge, understanding and why it wasn’t the end of my world as I knew it.<br /><br /> Hemophilia is a hidden disorder; my son appears completely healthy and acts that way most of the time. I have to educate others on why it can be deadly if he doesn’t get his medication. I also became an expert in portocaths*, specialty drugs, and insurance coverage, infusions, veinous access and how to poke a 5 year old with a needle every other day.  I did not want to, but I had to gain the upper hand over this and to show my son that it is manageable, doable and  would not hold him back.<br /><br /> He sometimes asks why he has this and complains about it; I tell him we all have challenges and problems and this is one of his challenges and it will make him braver, tougher and stronger than he already is.<br /><br />                                                                                           *******<br /><br /> *A portocath is a small, circular device doctors place under the skin. It has a small tube leading to the bloodstream to make it easier to have access to a vein.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 12.02.2018.

17	31	2	Constipation in Older Individuals	A friend, who is in his late sixties, called me the other day saying he was having problems with constipation and did I have any ideas. He was away from his home and was unable or unwilling to reach his regular doctor. I told him that as people get older the movement or motility or the bowel slows down. Then as seniors get less exercise and often gain weight that can cause addition problems. The problem got so bad that the man went to an Urgent Care place near where he was staying. The young woman doctor neither did a rectal examination or ask him about his diet. Both of these are unacceptable and just bad medicine.I wonder if medical schools are even teaching their students to do rectal examinations these days. I have picked up quite a few unusual problems by insisting on doing a rectal examination when I did a regular physical examination or if there was a bowel problem. The young doctor suggested that the man eat flax seeds and something else I had never heard of. Obviously, her interest was in holistic or alternative medicine. I went over the man's diet with him and suggested adding prunes, more fiber, a stool softener, and if necessary a mild laxative, such as Puralax. (This also goes by other names.) Some people find Metamucil works, but I have not found this to be helpful for patients. I suggested the man drink lots of water and get more exercise. Also, I reminded him that bananas and apples are constipating, as is rice. Sadly, few doctors discuss diet with patients, I have found, so if you have an elderly family member in trouble with constipation, do ask what the individual is eating<br />Article last time updated on 22.01.2018.

18	31	2	Checking for Dangerous Drug Interactions	A neurologist was not seen and no sleep apnea test was done. His doctor gave the man a new heart medicine and I found out that the husband was taking quite a few medications. I asked if the physician had checked to be sure there were no drug interactions and my friend didn't think the doctor had done this. I told her how often I found problems with drug interactions in patients when different doctors were seen and no one had called a pharmacist to check that all the drugs could be given together. It takes time to do this and I find that unfortunately few physicians do it.<br /><br /> I was fortunate to have access to a special doctor's line at the UC School of Pharmacy in San Francisco and often found that the various drugs prescribed by other doctors for my patients should not be given together or had bad side effects. These can be dangerous and if your doctor does not check for drug interactions, I would suggest that each patient find a good pharmacist who will check drug interactions for you. You could save your own life or that of a family member or prevent some bad, often dangerous, side effects. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Matvevna/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 10.01.2018.

19	31	2	Problems with Vegetarian Diets for Children and Adults	I had a telephone call the other day from a sixty-year-old woman who asked my thoughts about why she had had a fracture of her leg and a hip replacement. Now she has a new crack in the bone of her leg. I knew she was a vegetarian and in asking her about her diet, I found she was eating little protein and calcium. Even with the three problems with her bones, her doctor had not asked about her diet or done a test for osteopenia or osteoporosis, calcium, or Vitamin D.  She was not drinking milk or taking any calcium supplement. I must admit that I was not surprised the doctors were providing such inadequate care. Even surgeons should know that diet and calcium intake can make a difference. The woman is not  overweight and gets exercise when she is not bedridden with her hip and leg problems. The orthopedic surgeon she was seeing was technically good, but certainly wasn't looking at the whole patient.<br /><br /> I realize few medical schools teach anything about nutrition. I have been told by medical students and house staff that I am the only doctor they have ever heard ask about diet.  Even gastroenterologists, in my expereince, don't ask about food intake, which always amazes me.<br /><br /> Children on a vegetarian diet can get into real trouble with malnutrition. Dr. Henry Legere in his book, Raising Healthy Eaters, notes that a child must eat anywhere from three to seven times as much non-meat protein to get the amount of protein in a single serving of meat or cheese. Two cups of beans would equal two slices of cheese. Amazing! Also, a child has to eat much larger quantities of everything to get what is needed for growth and development.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 27.11.2017.

20	31	2	Medical Concerns About Tattoos and Piercings	"Many teens these days have a hard time being themselves either because of a lack of self-esteem or the need to belong to the crowd. Because of this tattoos and piercings are sadly becoming very common. I live now in a small beach town and was amazed this summer to see so many tattoos. I wondered if the teens had permission from their parents to get these or if there was even any discussion about the problems that could develop from piercings or tattoos. <br /><br /> I had a teenage patient several years ago who was on cortisone (prednisone) because of a serious muscle disorder (dermatomyositis). She came in one day to be checked and said ""You are going to be upset with me, Dr. Thompson."" I asked why and she stuck out her tongue. In the center was a silver ball. I explained to her the risk she was taking because of her disease and taking prednisone. Then I said, ""Either the ball comes out and stays out or I can no longer be your doctor."" She turned a little pale, but the ball came out and stayed out.<br /><br /> As parents, I think a serious discussion is needed about the risk of both tattoos and piercings. Even if there is not a medical problem, teens need to know the risks. Infection is one, as is the fact that tattoos are permanent. They can be removed but severe scarring can result. Patients with any kind of medical problem are at a particualr risk. Also a ball on the tongue can cause chipping of teeth.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />lifrita lifi/flickr/CCBY <br />Article last time updated on 21.11.2017."

21	31	2	Causes of Choking in Little Children	"An article in the American Academy of Pediatrics newsletter gave a list of items that can cause choking in little children. The article listed the ten more common objects that could cause a little child to choke: hot dogs, hard candy, nuts, grapes, carrots, apples, popcorn, peanut butter and even biscuits. I'm puzzled about how biscuits could cause choking unless they were rock hard. This survey came from forty-eight children's hospitals from around the world.<br /><br /> The other non-food items listed were: ""small toys, pen caps, small balls or foam balls, marbles, toy jewelry, magnets, coins, and disk batteries."" The one thing I found missing from the list were toys that had parts which could be pulled off and swallowed. An item not listed was pacifiers that can be pulled apart. Balloons can also be inhaled and cause choking. So parents and caretakers have to be very vigilant about what is around that children can put in their mouths. Little children have very small airways that can be easily obstructed. All parents and caretakers need to know CPR and what to do if a child starts choking. I always shudder when I see a small child in a grocery store or other place munching on Cheerios, life-savers or similar foods. It just takes a single peanut or small cube of cheese to mean the difference between life and death unless a caretaker is vigilant. I was on an airplane one day when a doctor was called for. A small child was choking on a peanut. I fortunately was able to get the child breathing again but always worry when I see little children with peanuts and similar objects in their hands and near their mouths.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Efraimstochter/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 20.10.2017."

22	31	2	Anesthesia Problems with Some Muscle Diseases	I was talking with a woman recently whose son had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The boy was to have surgery and I wanted to be sure the doctors had discussed possible anesthetic problems with the mother. The woman had no idea what I was talking about and I was appalled. I wondered if her doctors didn't know about the risk of the disorder, Malignant Hyperthermia, with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and some of the other muscle diseases or they just didn't want to worry the woman. I explained about the disorder and suggested the mother check with the anesthesiologist to be sure he or she knew about Malignant Hyperthermia and the relationship to Duchenne dystrophy. The anesthesiologist should always have a special tray with medications ready in case there is a problem and succinylcholine or halothane must not be used as anesthetic agents.<br /><br /> Children have more problems with Malignant Hyperthermia than adults and the disorder can be fatal if it is not recognized and immediately treated. Sixty percent of patients die if the disorder develops full-blown symptons.  Of particular concern are the patients who have Central Core disease because both disorders have the same genetic locus. Central Core disease is in the group of Congenital Myopathies and is easily recognized on muscle biopsy if the biopsy is done and processed correctly.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Michael Bär/flickr/CC BY SA <br />Article last time updated on 13.09.2017.

23	31	2	When Patients Seek Advice From A Specialist But Don't Take It	About ten years ago, I saw a child with muscle weakness who most likely had a congenital myopathy. After examining the little girl, I said that in addition to getting a CPK blood test a muscle biopsy was needed. I explained that it would be done under a local anesthetic and I would be in the room to help the surgeon. I explained there would be minimal pain and only a small scar and the child could immediately go back to playing or do whatever the parents had planned. The parents became thoughtful and said they would let me know what they decided. I did have a phone call several days later saying they had decided to wait about having the biopsy done.<br /><br /> That was the last I heard until a few years ago when I had an e-mail saying their child had more weakness and what should they do. I was no longer in practice and once again said a muscle biopsy was needed. Unfortunately, the only places they could have a muscle biopsy done were with surgeons who would insist on a general anesthetic. If the child had Central Core disease, which is one of the congenital myopathies, this could put her a great risk for a condition called Malignant Hyperthermia. With the wrong anesthetic, the child could have serious problems and deaths have been reported.<br /><br /> If adults don't want to take a specialist's advice, that is one thing, but for parents to assume they know better than a specialist, it makes little sense. I understand if it is because of religious reasons, but even then putting a child at risk when there could even be some treatment is beyond my understanding.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ben Husmann/flickr/CC-BY <br />Article last time updated on 29.11.2017.

24	32	2	Episode 3: The Prior Authorization Games: Where the Odds are Never in Your Favor	"In this episode, I chronicle some of my latest and most flabbergasting interactions with the insurance companies when requesting “prior authorization” for necessary medical care for my patients.<br />  <br /><br /> First, a quick explanation of the title of this post series (be sure to read Episode 1 and Episode 2, if you missed them):<br /><br /> Just like in The Hunger Games, in The Prior Authorization Games, doctors are pitted in unwilling (verbal) battle against their peers.  Our arena?  The insurance company.  Extreme analogy, you say?  While we are not battling to the death (at least, not yet), we are fighting for the lives of our patients.  And this is not fiction, it is reality.  A few case examples will follow:<br /><br /> Case #1*:<br /><br /> My patient is a woman in her mid-forties with stage IV cancer, who is stable on chemotherapy. She has had stage IV cancer for several years.  With chemotherapy, her disease is in control, and she lives an active life, raising kids and continuing to work a job outside the home as well.  She required a procedure that necessitated a pause in the currently effective chemotherapy for 2 months.  Once she recovered from the procedure, we scheduled the re-start of her chemotherapy.  But her insurance company notified us that they would no longer cover the chemotherapy. I needed to do a “peer-to-peer” phone call with a physician at the insurance company.<br /><br /> This should be easy, I thought.  It was probably a matter of the initial approval date expiring.  Surely they’re not denying a currently effective therapy.  I could demonstrate that the patient was on a chemotherapy that was working against her cancer, and it should be straightforward to get it re-authorized.  It was the usual hassle of scheduling the phone call (at the convenience of the insurance company physician, not taking into account my schedule) and interrupting my time with other patients, but once on the phone I thought this one would be a slam-dunk.  I should have known better.  I should have remembered the clinician’s dogma of experience with prior authorizations:  where the odds are never in your favor.<br /><br /> As the physician on the phone said no repeatedly, I requested to know his specialty.<br /><br /> To my surprise, he said he was also a board-certified medical oncologist.<br /><br /> “Well, thank goodness!”  I said.  “This is the first time I’ve done a peer-to-peer call and actually been able to speak with a fellow oncologist.”  I went into a level of detail about the patient’s treatment that could only be appreciated by another medical oncologist.  But as I continued, he interrupted me.<br /><br /> “How did you get this chemo approved in the first place?”  he demanded.  Wait — what?  This led us to a debate about the NCCN guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) and the role of this particular chemo.<br /><br /> I finally had to interrupt.  “I think you’re missing the point – whether or not you agree academically with my choice of this chemotherapy – it is working – we have radiographic proof of response.”<br /><br /> He hemmed and hawed some more and finally, finally!, agreed to re-approve a therapeutic treatment that was working.  His last words stuck in my mind.  He ultimately decided he “could live with” my choice for the patient’s chemotherapy.  At that point, I bit my tongue, because he was finally giving me an approval number, which was what I needed for my patient’s care.  Ego had no place here.  But in my head, I thought, “Oh, well, of course, that’s what’s really important here.  I’m so glad you can live with it.  Because my patient actually needs this medication to live.”<br /><br /> The recent news that a former medical director at Aetna admitted under oath that he did not look at the medical records when denying authorizations, came as no surprise to any physician in the U.S. in current practice, anywhere.<br /><br /> As I argue in Episode 1, why is the process of board certification not enough? Why does the U.S. healthcare insurance system not trust that board-certified specialists who order tests and treatments are doing so in the best interests of our patients and according to standards of care?  Why have a board certification process at all, if the ultimate decision on the approval of a test lies with a physician, often in an unrelated specialty, employed by the insurance company?<br /><br /> In both prior posts, Episode 1 and Episode 2, I give some further examples of cases, and of strategies that worked, in addition to helpful links to other posts by physicians on dealing with insurance company prior authorizations.<br /><br /> Case 2:<br /><br /> Along that line, next I want to share an excerpt from a letter that succeeded in obtaining approval for a PET scan that had been denied.  I hope this example might be helpful to my peers.  As other physicians have recommended (see again links above), citing evidence and guidelines, and pointing out the patient harm that will result from the denial by the insurance company, is often a successful strategy.<br /><br /> In this particular case*, myself and my staff had appealed on behalf of the patient for over 1 month.<br /><br /> It was imperative that we obtain a repeat PET scan to determine if the treatment was working or not.  For unknown reasons, this company would not allow a peer-to-peer call.  (That’s right — when we asked to speak to the medical director, we were refused).  They did finally say I could write a letter.  Here is an excerpt of what I wrote:<br /><br /> ""Treatment decisions for my patient hinge on whether there is interval change by PET/CT scan.<br /><br /> As per the NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2017, Invasive Breast Cancer, with NCCN Evidence Blocks, PET/CT scan is a validated measure of disease progression.  To directly quote the NCCN guidelines, “The most accurate assessments of disease activity typically occur when previously abnormal studies are repeated on a serial and regular basis.  Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time.”<br /><br /> (https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/breast_blocks.pdf)<br /><br />Your denial of the PET/CT scan, in direct contraindication of the NCCN guidelines, is hindering the care of my patient.  Already we will have to delay a treatment decision because the PET/CT scan we had scheduled for her had to be cancelled when it did not receive a prior authorization.”<br /><br /> A few days later, my staff were on the phone still trying to schedule the peer-to-peer review call for me, when, lo and behold, they were told a call would not be necessary —  the PET/CT scan was approved.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Case 3:<br /><br /> One final case example for this post.*  I was on the phone, doing yet another peer-to-peer call (does it seem like I spend a lot of time doing this?  I do!  As do all my colleagues…).  The reason for this call was to obtain prior authorization for an MRI scan for a patient with a new diagnosis of lung cancer.  It is an oncologic standard of care (and in the NCCN guidelines), to obtain an MRI of the brain at the time of diagnosis, even if the patient has no particular symptoms related to the brain.  The conversation was going around and around, as the physician I was speaking to could not seem to accept this.<br /><br /> Remembering my experience in case 1 above, I politely asked what the physician’s specialty was.<br /><br /> Cardiology, she told me.  I took a deep breath and (again, politely) explained the NCCN guidelines and rationale for staging MRI of the brain.  It was clear she did not want to approve it, but it also must have been clear to her that I was not getting off the phone without the approval.  “Fine!”  she ultimately said (angrily), and gave me the approval number.  “But I have never heard of this,” she insisted.  “Why don’t you just get a PET scan!?”**<br /><br />Thunk. <br /><br /> (sound of my forehead hitting desk).<br /><br /> *details in all cases changed to protect patient privacy<br /><br /> ** the patient did have a PET scan.  PET scans are not sufficient to stage the brain.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Posted first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br />Article last time updated on 12.03.2018."

25	32	2	Cancer survivorship: 8 key updates from the 2018 ASCO/AAFP/ACP Cancer Survivorship Symposium	"In my first year of oncology fellowship, our program director asked us a question:  what percentage of people with cancer survived 5 years or more?<br /><br /> At that time, in 2003, the answer was 60%.  I was appalled that fewer than half of us fellows, physicians embarking on a subspecialty training program to devote our careers to treating people with cancer, got the answer correct, with estimates of cancer survivorship ranging as low as 30%.  That was 2 years before the 2005 landmark Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, ""From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition.""<br /><br /> 70% of people diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. today will live 5 years or more, and that number is only expected to increase with the advent of newer therapies.<br /><br /> In the welcoming Lecture for Advancement of Cancer Survivorship Care, Dr. Patricia Ganz, recipient of the Ellen L. Stovall Award, spoke eloquently on Cancer Survivorship and Quality of Care:  A Thirty Year Journey.<br /><br /> From the founding of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (NCCS) in 1986, the advocacy-led movement that insisted we stop calling people cancer ""victims,"" but instead cancer survivors; to the 2005 IOM Lost in Transition report; to the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Oncology Care Model, Dr. Ganz outlined the challenges and opportunities in delivering high-quality survivorship care in a cancer care system in crisis.  She also delivered a moving tribute to the memory of Ellen Stovall, who she called the ""leading light and champion"" of survivorship care, and reminded us that cancer survivorship is a condition of its own.<br /><br /> As of January 2018, there are over 16 million cancer survivors in the U.S.  A cancer survivor is defined as anyone with cancer from the time of diagnosis for the balance of their life, and includes family, friends, and caregivers.<br /><br />Here are 8 takeaway updates from the Symposium:<br /><br /> 1. Survivorship matters.<br /><br /> 1.6 million people per year are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S.   By 2022, there will be at least 18 million people in the U.S. who are cancer survivors.  Yet cancer treatment usually occurs in isolation from primary health care delivery, as Dr. Ganz pointed out in her lecture.  Historically this has led to ad hoc follow up care plans, and oncologists' focus on surveillance for cancer recurrence, instead of a focus on health promotion.  Yet many (if not most) of people being diagnosed with cancer in the U.S will die of something other than cancer: with that #1 ""something other"" being heart disease.<br /><br />Dr. Julia Rowland, discussant in Oral Abstract Session B, outlined these trends, putting in context that in 1971, when Nixon declared the ""War on Cancer,"" there were only 3 million cancer survivors in the U.S., and < 50% would be expected to live 5 years or more.  Contrast that with our current 16 million survivors and 70% expected survivor rate.  As she put it, ""health promotion after cancer matters.""<br /><br /> 2.  Financial toxicity of cancer treatments causes significant morbidity.<br /><br /> A paradox of cancer survivorship care is that the increase in the number of cancer survivors coincides with the rapid rise in cancer treatment costs since the 1990s.  Healthcare trends affecting financial hardship include an increase in high deductible plans, an increase in patient cost-sharing (among insured patients), an increase in the uninsured, and an increase in ""specialty tier"" medications (for example, a 30% out-of-pocket cost for a specialty tier cancer medication costing $100,000 per year means a $30,000 per year out-of-pocket cost solely for cancer medication.  A $400,000/year cancer medication (yes, that is a real-world number) would translate to $120,000/year out-of-pocket cost).<br /><br /> The Affordable Care Act (ACA) benefited cancer survivors in many ways, including providing out-of-pocket caps, allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until the age of 26 (dependent coverage expansion), elimination of annual and lifetime coverage limits, elimination of pre-existing condition denials, and increased coverage of clinical trial participation.<br /><br /> Speakers in General Session 1:  The Economic Impact on Survivors and Caregivers, outlined these issues and gave numerous examples of the negative effects of financial toxicity:<br /><br />  Cancer survivors who file for bankruptcy have an increased mortality rate.<br /><br />  Those with financial hardship are more likely to either delay, or not fill, prescriptions.<br /><br />  Increased financial hardship has been associated with increased disparities in cancer outcomes.<br /><br />  Financial hardship is not only material, but behavioral, which in essence means people limit their care because of cost.<br /><br /> Some proposed solutions included the creation of ""financial navigators,"" more up-front discussions and disclosures to people about their realistic abilities to work during treatment and after, and the need for the workplace to ""meet people halfway"".<br /><br /> Here are some resources for patients and caregivers:<br /><br />thesamfund.org<br /><br />cancercare.org<br /><br />cancercare.org/helpinghand<br /><br />needymeds.org<br /><br />cancerandcareers.org<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 3. The number of geriatric cancer survivors is increasing exponentially.<br /><br /> By 2025, the number of cancer survivors is anticipated to outweigh the supply of oncologists.  The incidence of cancer in those over age 65 has risen by 67%.  Yet patients over age 65 represent only roughly 10% of people in clinical trials.  We cannot afford to not better study this segment of the population.  In the Keynote Lecture, Dr. Arti Hurria spoke on Survivorship Care for the Aging Population, and the need to better understand how cancer therapies might lead to a premature aging syndrome that significantly affects quality of life in the elderly treated for cancer.<br /><br /> 4. New cancer therapies are leading to new kinds of survivors.<br /><br /> The advent of newer cancer therapies such as the immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as oral targeted agents, has led to a new kind of cancer survivor, the ""on-treatment responders.""  These therapies may lead to remission, but ongoing chronic treatments.  These survivors and their families are facing a long-term unknown.<br /><br /> Oncologists are reminded to remember to include pre-treatment fertility counseling for this group of patients.<br /><br /> 5.  Psychosocial toxicities of cancer treatments remain an unmet need.<br /><br /> In 2008, the IOM report ""Cancer Care for the Whole Patient"" outlined the standard of care for psychosocial health for people with cancer.  From the depression and cognitive effects of cancer therapies, to fear of cancer recurrence, to risk of suicide, speakers at the symposium reminded us that there is an unmet need for better integrating mental health care into medical survivorship care.<br /><br /> While cancer is the #2 cause of death in the U.S., suicide remains the #10 cause of death.  Cancer increases the risk of suicide overall by 50%, with increased rates in men over women, and the highest incidences of suicide in cancer seen in pancreatic cancer, and head and neck cancers.  A struggle with functionality post-cancer treatment is another risk factor, and was identified as an unmet pyschosocial need in cancer survivors.<br /><br /> 6.  Eat less, exercise more.  And quit smoking!<br /><br /> Yes, these are all still true, and more important than ever for cancer survivors.<br /><br /> The best treatment for cancer fatigue is exercise.  Exercise leads to a decrease in symptoms of toxicity, increase in quality of life, as well as a decrease in cancer recurrence, and decrease in mortality.<br /><br /> The best diet for weight loss is still calorie restricted, for men an approximate target is 1500-1800 calories per day, and for women, 1200-1500 calories per day.  There is still no evidence for dietary supplements, and the best evidence still shows that it is best to meet vitamin and mineral needs through diet, not supplements.  What works:  a brisk walk 1 hour per day, and decreasing screen time.  The elderly should aim to increase protein to avoid loss of muscle while losing weight.  Digital health tools can help (i.e. FitBit, apps to track calories and exercise, etc).<br /><br /> Those who are diagnosed with cancer while being smokers should not have a nihilistic attitude about smoking, because smoking cessation improves outcome of cancer therapies. <br /><br /> Dr. Graham Warren, in General Session 3: Health Promotion After Cancer --  How to Move the Needle, reminded us of the cost of those who do not quit and thus fail first-line cancer treatment due to ongoing tobacco smoking:  3.4 billion dollars per year in the U.S..<br /><br /> 7. The Survivorship Care Plan is not just a piece of paper.<br /><br /> In the 2005 IOM ""Lost in Transition"" report, recommendation #2 was for a ""Survivorship Care Plan"" (SCP).<br /><br /> The basics of an SCP include 2 parts: (1)  a treatment summary, and (2) a follow-up care plan.<br /><br /> However, many barriers exist to adopting SCP's, including limitations on provider time, resources, and reimbursement.<br /><br /> Furthermore, a review of 13 randomized-control trials on the implementation of SCP's failed to show an impact on survivors quality of life.  Does this mean we should give up on SCP's?<br /><br /> The bottom line, according to the Commission on Cancer (COC) chairman, Dr. Lawrence Shulman, is that the ""SCP doesn't mean anything if it's not connected to a survivorship care program.""  In other words, it's not just about the piece of paper.<br /><br /> Dr. Shulman (and other speakers) reminded the audience that from the time of the 2005 IOM report and recommendation, nothing was happening to move the needle for survivorship care, until the 2016 COC standards (version 3.3) mandated the SCP as part of COC accreditation.  However, he acknowledged that in some circumstances the focus seems to have been lost -- that the SCP is a tool to address unmet needs of survivors about survivorship care, and that SCPs do not replace that conversation.  He stood by the COC requirement for a written SCP, because the COC standard is ""the only action that has gotten survivorship care on the radar.""<br /><br /> However, he stated there is clearly a need to link the SCP to an infrastructure to deliver survivorship care.  To address this, effective 1/1/19, the COC will add a requirement for a survivorship care coordinator.<br /><br /> 8.  To be successful, we must foster more cooperation and communication between oncologists and primary care providers.<br /><br /> Not all patients can, nor should, need to see an oncologist forever.  As stated in #3 above, by 2025, the number of cancer survivors is anticipated to outweigh the supply of oncologists. We need a triage model of care, in which low-risk patients can transition survivorship care to their PCP.  This was shown to be successful in one model of breast cancer survivorship care.<br /><br /> The SCP is the tool that is supposed to help transition survivorship care to the PCP.  Yet SCP's have to be accessible, relevant, and functional, in order to be of any use to the primary care provider.  They should be simple and confined to 1 page.  They should be easy to access and view in the EMR, and they should help clarify the role of the PCP in survivorship care.<br /><br /> If we expect our primary care colleagues to help us provide survivorship care to our patients, we need to do a better job on educating PCP's on what survivorship care is, and include this in residency training.  One successful model used a one-time 60-minute workshop on survivorship care for PCP's.<br /><br /> We need smarter follow-up, and to empower our patients.  We need to leverage technology to help achieve this.<br /><br /> By 2040, the U.S. is projected to have 26 million cancer survivors.  We will not succeed in providing adequate, yet alone high-quality, survivorship care, without the help of our Internal Medicine and Family Medicine colleagues.  Now is the time to build these collaborations and workflows.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> As a last takeaway consider this:<br /><br />Dr. Hurria pointed out during her keynote address that there is currently $35 billion in Medicare spending per year for cancer treatment, yet there are no established billing codes for survivorship care.<br /><br /> As compared to my entering oncology fellowship class fifteen years ago, oncologists have come a long way in recognizing and addressing survivorship care.  I was heartened by the number of other providers at the symposium invested in survivorship care -- from allied care providers to internists to family medicine practitioners to social workers, dieticians, physical therapists, and others.  As we move forward, let's hope the systems of care do as well, so that we are provided with the resources that will be needed for success.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Did you attend the Symposium?  Add your comments below.<br /><br />  <br /><br />published first at thehopefulcancerdoc.com<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 20.02.2018."

26	32	2	Why you might need chemotherapy after surgery: the basics of adjuvant chemotherapy.	"What is adjuvant therapy?<br /><br /> One of the most common questions I hear at an initial visit, as a medical oncologist, is:<br /><br /> “My surgeon told me she got all the cancer.  So why am I here?”<br /><br /> One of the jobs of the medical oncologist is to teach our patients that cancer is a systemic disease.<br /><br /> That means even though it started in one part of the body, there can be cancer cells in other places of the body.  That can go undetected for months or even years before they cause a problem.<br /><br /> There are therapies that we can offer, called adjuvant therapies, that can decrease the chance that those cells can grow into new tumors months, and yes, even years, later, what is called metastatic disease.<br /><br /> First, some definitions.<br /><br />“Adjuvant” = any therapy given after surgery to increase the chance of being cured after surgery.  This can include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, endocrine (hormonal) therapy, and immunotherapy.<br /><br />“Cure” = living out the rest of one’s life cancer-free and dying of something other than cancer.  (You will note that this definition means we cannot say whether one is “cured” at any timepoint prior to death from another cause.  Rather, we can estimate the likelihood one is cured.)<br /><br />“Metastases” = sites of cancer that have grown outside of the initial origin of the cancer.  This can be confusing.  I like to explain to my patients that cancer is always “named” for the site of origin.  One example is breast cancer.  If breast cancer metastasizes, (or travels, spreads), to the bone, it is not “bone cancer.”  It is breast cancer, metastatic to bone.  How do we know this?  Because if we did a biopsy, and the pathologist identifies the cells under the microscope, they are breast cancer cells, not bone cancer cells.<br /><br />“Cancer-free” = the assumption that there is no remaining or active cancer in the body.<br /><br />“Remission” = the best evidence suggests no evidence of remaining or active cancer in the body.<br /><br />Confused yet?  Let’s use a (hypothetical) example to try to make it more clear.<br /><br /> Ms. Smith is a 55 year old woman who went in for her yearly mammogram and an abnormality was found in her left breast.  Fortunately, it was small, but a biopsy showed it was cancerous.  She was referred to a surgeon who sat down with her and explained her two options for surgery, mastectomy (removal of the entire breast tissue), or breast-conserving surgery, also called “lumpectomy” (removal of only the tumor and a small portion of the breast surrounding it).  Mrs. Smith would like to preserve her breast, but she is afraid that if she does not have mastectomy, she will have a lesser chance of cure.<br /><br /> Her surgeon explains that if she chooses lumpectomy, it will be recommended to have adjuvant radiation therapy afterward, and that if she completes this, she has the same chance of cure as someone in the same situation who chooses mastectomy.  Huh?  Ms. Smith is confused.  Let’s break it down to explain why:<br /><br />  Over several decades, it was proven that more and more aggressive, extensive, and disfiguring breast surgeries, did not impact the long-term cure rates for breast cancer.  i.e., even women who had extensive removal of tissue under and around the breast, including muscle --“radical” mastectomy -- still had metastatic recurrences of breast cancer months to years later, to the surgeons’ dismay.  Ultimately, surgeons realized that breast cancer is not just a disease of the breast. If breast cancer cells have metastasized, or ‘escaped’, into the body, BEFORE the surgery, it does not matter how extensive the mastectomy is, the cancer can recur months to years later, because those cells can hide in other tissues (such as bone, bone marrow, liver), and grow new tumors months to years later.  (For an elegant in-depth discussion of the history and evolution of breast cancer surgeries, I highly recommend the book ""The Emperor of All Maladies,” by Siddhartha Mukherjee.  Don’t be put off by the size of the book, it is highly readable.  It was also made into a documentary series by PBS).<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Once this reality gained widespread acceptance, surgeons instead turned to doing SMALLER surgeries. To summarize many decades of research, the current standard of care is that a lumpectomy need only remove enough tissue to show (to the pathologist, under the microscope), that there are no cancer cells at the margin (the edge of the tissue that has been removed), and that if then paired with adjuvant radiation therapy, will have equal long-term survival rates as mastectomy.  Please note, this is key, PAIRED WITH RADIATION.  I sometimes meet patients who choose a lumpectomy, but then tell me afterward they are not going to choose the radiation.  Unfortunately, that is not how it works.  I tell my patients, IF YOU CHOOSE LUMPECTOMY, THAT MEANS YOU ARE CHOOSING ADJUVANT RADIATION.  They go together, we do not consider it optional.  (one possible exception would be a woman over age 70 with a small tumor with no high-risk features, but again that is a discussion that needs to happen between the woman and her surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist).<br /><br />   <br /><br />Whether Mrs. Smith chooses mastectomy, or lumpectomy with radiation, she will need to meet with a medical oncologist after surgery, to review her risk of future recurrence, and whether she needs adjuvant medical therapies. Let’s continue the story to illustrate this better:<br /><br /> Ms. Smith is relieved by the information and chooses lumpectomy with adjuvant radiation therapy.  (As an aside, I should mention that not all breast cancer qualifies for lumpectomy – this should always be a discussion between a woman and her surgeon – but some factors that can disqualify a woman from being a candidate from lumpectomy can include (and are not limited to) a very large tumor and/or more than one tumor in the breast).<br /><br /> She does well with surgery, and at her post-op visit, her surgeon explains that she ""got it all"" and the ""lymph nodes are clear.""  Ms. Smith is relieved and prepares herself for the next step of her post-lumpectomy radiation, but then she is alarmed and confused when her surgeon recommends, and sets up a consultation with, a medical oncologist.<br /><br />The first thing she says to the medical oncologist is, ""My surgeon said she got it all, so I don't even know why I'm here.""<br /><br /> Here's what I tell my patients:<br /><br /> Breast cancer, like most all cancers, is tricky.  It can be sneaky.  Even small tumors, not in the lymph nodes, (stage I), have a small risk of recurrence over time.  For hormonally sensitive breast cancer (often referred to as ""ER - positive"", ER = estrogen receptor), this risk persists for life.  (A recent NEJM meta-analysis of over 60,000 women with breast cancer sheds more evidence on this).  I tell my patients that I do not tell them this to frighten them, but to empower them to make the best medical decisions for themselves.<br /><br /> I would explain to Ms. Smith that taking a pill medication with overall low rate of side effects once per day for the next 5 years would lower her risk of the breast cancer coming back by about 50%, and lower the risk of dying from breast cancer by 30%.  I would also explain that it is not a guarantee; unfortunately a small number of women could still relapse, and even die from breast cancer, despite taking the anti-estrogen pill.  Our job as medical oncologists is to advise our patients when they are in a high enough risk group of that happening, that taking several months of chemotherapy after surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy) would be ""worth it"" to lower their risk. (i.e. the potential life-saving benefits outweigh the potential risks of treatment).<br /><br /> Historically, the main predictors of risk of relapse and metastases were anatomic - the size of the tumor and whether or not there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes.  More and more however we are learning that the risk is not always tied to anatomic features - sometimes cancers can be small in size, but aggressive in behaviour - and again, it is our job as medical oncologists to analyze and interpret the findings of the pathology report to advise our patients.<br /><br /> Ms. Smith is relieved to learn her risk of recurrence is overall low, but upset to hear that the risk is not zero.  She wants to know why there isn't a scan or blood test that could be done to determine if she needs chemotherapy.<br /><br /> This is a great question, and there is quite a bit of research working on a blood test, but that is likely still years away.  In the meantime we do have some risk-stratifying tests that can be run on the tumor tissue (beyond the scope of this post - I think I'll have to devote another post just to this topic), and we, as medical oncologists, will advise our patients when we think those tests should be done.<br /><br /> But as for scans, they will not help us, as we are talking about treating microscopic cancer cells -- not possible to see on CT scans or PET scans. (or MRI, or ultrasound, or any other imaging test).<br /><br /> So to conclude the story:  Ms. Smith and her medical oncologist decide together that her breast cancer is in a low enough risk group that she would not necessarily benefit from chemotherapy.  She proceeds to her radiation therapy treatments, and when they are completed, she will return to her medical oncologist to start her endocrine adjuvant therapy (the anti-estrogen pill).<br /><br /> While this example focused on breast cancer, we have these same discussions every day with patients with almost all other types of cancer after surgery.  For each person, we use all the available clinical data to make a risk assessment, but we also take into account each person's age, health, level of function, living situation, goals, and support system, before making a recommendation.  This is what we mean when we say we individualize the cancer care.  Expect this visit to last 45-60 minutes (or even longer), and believe that your oncologist has spent already that same amount of time, or more, analyzing your case, and talking with your surgeon.<br /><br /> If you are reticent to meet with a medical oncologist, I hope this article will help change your mind.  At the least, try to go into the appointment with an open mind.  Even if it is not the news you want to hear, if your medical oncologist recommends adjuvant treatments, they are doing so with your best long-term interests in mind, which is to give you the best chance of cure.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  This is by no means an exhaustive coverage of this topic (which would be impossible to do in under1800 words), nor is this meant in any way to be used as medical advice.  Please see full site disclaimers on the about me page.<br /><br />Published first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br /><br /> Image Copyright (outer article): Anna_Sunny/pixabay/CC0<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />The Hopeful Cancer Doc <br />Article last time updated on 08.02.2018."

27	32	2	My Mom is a Doctor, My Dad is a Dad.	“My dad usually stays home and cleans up, and takes care of the pets.”<br /><br /> I thought for a moment. “That’s very good, honey, but do you think you could write something else about Dad?” I suggested. “He does other stuff too, add some more nice things.”<br /><br /> “Ok, how about … ‘And he takes care of us, because my mom works all the time.’”<br /><br /> Ugh, not exactly what I was going for. I tried not to show any hurt feelings on my face. “Honey, I don’t work all the time, do I?”<br /><br /> He thought hard and then responded, “Oh, I know, I know! How about this — ‘He takes care of us because our mom works most of the time.’” His face was beaming with pride at his adaptation of the sentence.<br /><br /> And so that is how it reads in the final draft he turned in to his teacher. I can’t wait to see it up in the hallway at parent-teacher conference night.<br /><br /> I have been thinking a lot lately about the parenting role-reversal that exists when the woman is the full-time bread-winner and the man is the stay-at-home-parent.The following are a few examples from our lives.<br /><br /><br /> One of my favorites is from about 10 years ago, when our oldest was in preschool. It was a weekend and we were both home. The phone rang and my husband answered. (yes, back then we used an actual landline). It was the preschool teacher calling to tell us about a change in schedule. A few moments later he handed the phone to me with a frustrated look on his face. “She insists to talk to ‘my wife.’”<br /><br /> I took the phone and listened as she went into detail about the schedule change. After the call I relayed the information back to my husband, who was the one who really needed to know it, as he brought our child to and from the preschool.<br /><br /> “Strange, she absolutely insisted to talk to you,” my husband said.<br /><br /> We then burst out laughing as we realized it was because the teacher held to the stereotype that the father wouldn’t be involved in school schedules, and couldn’t possibly be trusted with the new information. With us, she had definitely gotten it backwards. Although we laughed about it, I could tell my husband was irked.<br /><br /> That was approximately 2007. Around 2009, during the time of the financial crisis, I started to notice that my husband was no longer the only stay-at-home dad in our children’s schools. An interesting thing happened — with the economic slow-down, many couples with children were making the choice for the woman to keep her job while the man stayed at home. It was a welcome change to no longer be the only ones we knew in this situation.<br /><br /> As our three children have advanced in school, and society seems to have adapted a bit more over the past 10 years, a situation like above with the teacher hasn’t repeated itself. Now he gets all the texts from teachers and coaches, and I rely on him 100% to keep track of our kids’ schedules. To be honest, at times I am downright envious to be the parent least in touch with the classrooms.<br /><br /> I have been subjected countless times to the comment, from both teachers and other parents, “So, you’re the mom!” As in, “so, you really do exist.” They say it with a grin but I don’t understand why, as it is not funny, it is hurtful, and, dare I say, sexist. I don’t think working fathers are subjected to this type of commentary when they come to a parent-teacher conference, even if it is the first time the teacher has ever met them. But for a working mother, others can’t seem to wait to rub the salt in the wounds of guilt.<br /><br /><br /> Similarly, I don’t think it is likely that a mother has ever been told by a teacher on the phone, “I can’t talk to you — let me talk to your husband so I can tell him about the school schedule change.”<br />  <br /><br /> Another example of being stereotyped by other parents: some years ago, in picking my daughter up from kindergarten, the only one day a week I could do this with my schedule, another parent eventually admitted to me that she and the other moms had thought for the whole first quarter that I was the nanny, since they hadn’t seen me at any other activities. Outwardly I laughed along, but inside my heart was bleeding. Ouch.<br /><br /> My husband and I never sat down and planned that he would become a stay-at-home-dad, it just evolved as our family grew. We realized life was a teeny bit less chaotic, and we could keep up with all the homework and extracurricular activities better, with one parent at home full-time. I am very grateful that I have a job and career that can support my family on a one-parent income. I know many women who work not because it’s a choice, but because their families would not survive without dual income.<br /><br /> Do I sometimes wish the stay-at-home parent was me? Absolutely. Do my children seem to mind that they have their dad instead of their mom as the stay-at-home parent? Absolutely not. As my son concluded in his essay, “My parents are of course just parents.”<br /><br />posted first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Image copyright (outer article): martieda/pixabay/CC0<br />Article last time updated on 24.10.2017.

28	32	2	Guilt and the Physician Mom: Doing Enough; not Perfection	Recently I was enjoying a “mom day” running errands with the kids, you know, the usual essentials -- groceries, school supplies, and espresso coffee drive-through. At this last stop, the barista made small talk and, seeing the kids in the back seat,  joked about school starting soon and how I must be looking forward to that -- “You’ll get your Mom time back!” To which I laughed and relished the rare moment of just being a Mom. Until one of my kids yelled up, “But, Mom, you work all the time!” <br /><br /> The previous week, sitting around the dinner table, this same child decided he wanted to give his take on what everyone did that day. We were enjoying his version of how everyone spent the day – my husband -- “mowed the lawn and did Dad stuff;” his siblings – “played with the dog, played with the iPad;” until it was my turn – he pointed an accusatory finger at me and yelled “Work, work, work!”  Not destined to be one of my cherished family memories.<br /><br />These episodes, and others, make me wonder how my kids are going to view me, and their childhood, when they are grown. In the best moments, I envision them grateful for two progressive parents who defied conventions and stereotypes by Mom working full-time as the bread-winner, and Dad staying at home full-time to make sure they were cared for, supported in school, and kept from actually building that zipline they drew that would take them from the top floor window to the bus stop across the street.<br /> In my worst moments, I envision them remembering me as that caffeine-addicted woman always at work, always in a rush, and too busy to notice that zipline under construction.<br /><br /> I know from discussions with colleagues I am not alone. Whether we have a spouse that stays at-home, a nanny, an au-pair, grandparents that watch the kids, utilize day-care, or some combination of the above, we constantly question our parenting decisions and life choices.  Are we doing the right thing?<br /><br />As Erma Bombeck wrote, “Guilt: the gift that keeps on giving.” <br /><br /> I don’t necessarily have any answers, but I do have another moment to share that helped make up for the others, and gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, my kids will one day view me more along the lines of option #1 above.<br /><br /> The same child who made the comments above has decided he, too, will grow up to be a doctor. “But, Mom,” he said, “I might feel kind of lonely.” I braced myself for what he was going to say next -- and to get hit with the next load of guilt.<br /><br /> He went on to say, “Because I might be the only boy – you know, since doctors are mostly all girls.”<br /><br /> So to my fellow physician-moms-in-guilt, I write: maybe we aren't perfect, but maybe, just maybe, we are doing enough right after all.<br /><br />posted first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />J.

29	32	2	The Invisible Burden of the Oncologist	The tension that years ago took up permanent residence in my shoulders had faded away without my noticing, so that when I awoke to its sudden return, I realized that for one wonderful week I had almost become used to its absence. Almost...<br /><br />  <br /><br />Why do I do this again? I asked myself.<br /><br /> As I contemplated this question, it was as if the burden of our profession sat quietly next to me on the floor, waiting patiently for me to pick it up.<br /><br />But I didn’t mean to actually put you down, I told it.<br /><br />I know, it seemed to reply in its silence.<br /><br />But really, I didn’t want to put you all the way down. You’re too hard to pick up again. I just meant to put you down a little bit.<br /><br /> No reply.<br /><br />What if I just don’t pick you up again?<br /><br /> Reproachful silence.<br /><br />Fine. Stay there while I go take a shower and think about whether I’m coming back to get you.<br /><br /> My thoughts wandered back in time to a backpacking trip in AK some two decades ago. I had gone with several friends who were somewhat more physically conditioned than me. We were doing an overnight backcountry camping trip. As I shouldered the pack, with sleeping bag and supplies, and fell in line behind my friends, it didn’t take long before I worried about how I was going to keep up with them while carrying my load. My ego prevented me from asking them to slow the pace, so I looked down at the trail and concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other.<br /><br /> When they finally stopped for a break, I gratefully set my pack down. But realized when we started up again, it felt twice as heavy having set it down for the brief rest. What did I get myself into? I wondered, as I staggered along at the rear of the group.<br /><br /> But later that night, when we finally made camp, in wilderness undisturbed by roads, accessible only to those who were willing to make the trek, in the land of the midnight sun, I looked around in awe and appreciation. The burden had been worth carrying.<br /><br /> I finished dressing for work and brought my mind back to focus on the present. I thought about the patients on my schedule. I glanced down at the burden of our profession, still patiently waiting.<br /><br />Well, come on then, I told it, what are you waiting for?  <br /><br /> published first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Image copyright (outer article): Skitterphoto/pixabay/CC0<br />Article last time updated on 26.09.2017.

30	32	2	Finding grace: an oncology patient's impact on her doctor.	At our first visit together, she grilled me without mercy. Her questions were insightful, and her demeanor was tough; I liked her immediately. I must have passed her test because she returned to see me again.<br /><br /> One hour was never enough time in the clinic. Her questions always had a twist I never thought of. I enjoyed our high-level conversations. She challenged me, but in a way that somehow never was unpleasant or difficult.<br /><br /> Yet each conversation would end in the same way; her fear would become more and more visible as she realized there was no question she could ask me that would change the answer I had to give to her ultimate question: there was yet no known cure. She would then change the subject, put on a bright air, give me a hug, and tell me she was ready to head back to the infusion room.<br /><br /> When she admitted to refractory nausea for over 1 month, with no correlation to her chemotherapy, my heart sank. I knew we had to repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain immediately. I prayed for my clinical gut instinct to be wrong, but when my radiology colleague called me with the news, I was not surprised. Just as the answers to her questions were always the same no matter how she phrased them, the cancer was acting out its biology in her body relentlessly, no matter how much I wanted to stop it.<br /><br /> Of all the things I thought she might say, she caught me off guard by expressing that she was sorry I was in the position to have to tell her the bad news. Several members of our team were in tears, but she was not. We went through the options. She decided she would try whole-brain radiation therapy.<br /><br /> The next day the flowers arrived. I was at once awed and humbled by this gesture of grace.<br /><br /> There is no surprise ending to this story. Her performance status declined rapidly. It became all too clear there would be no more chances for chemotherapy. When I went to see her in the hospital, she was curled in the fetal position. I crouched down so I could be on eye level with her, and she grasped my hands. She smiled at me and told me she loved me. Once again, she caught me off my guard. I could not speak; I didn’t want to break down in front of her and her husband. I tried to smile back.<br /><br /> Once she was home, an unprecedented invitation was received in the clinic. She wanted to have a gathering to say goodbye. We were all invited. She wanted it to be a celebration.<br /><br /> I personally find the moment of goodbye with a patient, whether it be in the clinic or hospital, to be one of internal struggle. Perhaps there was a day in fellowship that I missed when this was taught. Whether the patient and their loved ones are ready for hospice and welcoming of the transition, or whether they are resistant and we reach the decision together only after many conversations, there comes the moment when the decision is made, the conversation is over, and it is time to leave the room. Often I feel awkward, as I am uncertain whether my patient realizes this is the last time we will see each other. I try to convey warmth and sincerity as well as some sort of human contact before leaving the room, whether a handshake, a hug, or a hand on the shoulder. There are other times when I can see that my patient does indeed realize we are saying our final goodbyes.<br /><br /> Recently, a very frail man insisted on standing from his wheelchair to shake my hand, look me in the eye, give me a hug, and express his thanks, despite having failed all chemotherapy we had tried for palliation. I found myself lacking any words I thought could possibly match the solemnity of the moment. I mumbled something about how it was always my privilege to be his doctor. When his wife leaned over to hug him, I took the moment to leave the room. I typically have thought that as important a role as we think we may have as someone’s oncologist, once we step away, we fade quickly from the picture.<br /><br /> But the invitation from Nell, as with all my interactions with her, challenged my way of thinking yet again. I will admit that I was afraid to go. I was afraid to step past the barrier of the end of treatment and enter the home realm—the barrier our systems have created that separates us from the home palliative care and hospice team. When I looked at the calendar, I felt both guilt and relief when I saw that I would be out of town on a prearranged family trip. I asked one of our nurses, who was in close touch with her husband, to let them know. I wrote a letter and asked the nurse to give it to her.<br /><br /> Not long after the gathering, her husband was in touch with the clinic. She was declining rapidly, he e-mailed. He was appreciative of the hospice team. He wrote about all the many places they had visited over the past several years, exotic places around the world, how grateful he was for all that they had been able to do.<br /><br /> She died late at night. We found out from the hospice nurse the next day. The following day, her husband e-mailed another message. He described her taking a final sigh of relief. He described his relief that her pain was gone and that she was no longer suffering.<br /><br /> My nurse told me that she was not fully cognizant on the day of the goodbye celebration. I do not know if she read the letter, or if her husband read it to her or he chose not to. A part of me worried that he might have been offended by the letter (should doctors directly write to patients about impending death?) and perhaps decided not to read it to her at all.<br /><br />I wonder how many of my colleagues struggle with this—saying goodbye to a patient. Maybe some have figured out a way to express both the professional and spiritual aspects that no doubt we would all like to do in such moments. I do know that writing the letter helped provide some closure for me, which is typically missing. We are always moving on quickly to the next room, the next patient.<br /><br /> A palliative care physician colleague of mine, Dr. Erik Fromme, and I shared some e-mail correspondence recently about the remarkable people who, despite terrible illnesses and prognoses, exhibit a state of mind that manages to make those around them feel better. A person like Nell, who worries about her doctor’s feelings over her own, even when faced with catastrophic illness.<br /><br /> I have kept the card from the flowers on a shelf in my office. The hardest thing about those flowers was the feeling that I so little deserved them. I puzzled for a long time over what she felt when she sent them. She must have felt anger, fear, sadness—all normal reactions accompanying a devastating complication of cancer.<br /><br /> I eventually realized the flowers were a symbol. I think that she wanted to let me know that the news about the brain metastases had not taken away her inner grace, had not changed who she was. Although grace is a word that can have religious connotations, it also can mean a state of decency, honor, beauty, forgiveness. A gift of unmerited favor; the flowers were a gift of grace. A gift that I realize now I did not have to earn but could accept simply as she intended it.<br /><br /> In oncology, we encounter myriads of moments of grace in our practices every day, and they don’t leave us unchanged. I struggled with an ending to this narrative until I came across this passage by author Anne Lamott:<br /><br /> “I do not at all understand the mystery of grace—only that it meets us where we are but does not leave us where it found us.”1 <br /><br />  <br /><br />Reference<br /><br /> 1.

31	32	2	On bearing witness: an oncologist's role at end of life.	In order for me to examine him, she first stood in front of him, and then hoisted him up matter-of-factly under the shoulders. She smoothly turned to help him pivot onto the exam table.  The ease with which they accomplished this showed the number of times they had done it before.<br /><br /> When the exam was over she hefted him again, and he transitioned back into the wheelchair. Their eyes held laughter as they gazed into each other’s eyes. “Good thing you’ve always been so sturdy,” he said to her, and they both laughed. “Good thing I’ve never been skinny!” she joked back to him. I stood to the side, witnessing a love that surpassed the physical.<br /><br /> I have never forgotten the grace of this man who, in leaning completely on the woman he loved, and who loved him, seemed not weaker, but somehow stronger. And his wife, who put her own grief aside, in order to deal with the physical changes and challenges that the cancer had wrought, in ways that would not make him feel pitied.  Because she knew that was the one thing he could never bear.<br /><br /> Whatever private moments of bitterness they each may have had, they never showed it in the clinic.  Every visit I bore witness to a deep quiet strength.<br /><br /> There came a time where I saw that in the face of his illness, he knew that his time was near. I felt again my role was only to bear witness - he had already made his decision.<br />  <br /><br /> He asked her to be accepting of his death. I could see how she hated it with all her being, but she trusted him, because she knew how much he trusted her. She knew that he was trusting her to let him go in the way he was asking, while he still had his grace.<br /><br /> Another time, another patient, another moment<br />  <br /><br /> An older woman I was meeting for the first time. I took the history - she was pleasant and not at all anxious, and answered all my questions. It came time for the exam and I asked her if she could move onto the exam table. Her daughter, middle-aged, stood in front of her to help her up. They stood toe-to-toe, with their arms around each other. Then they shuffled around in a narrow circle, feet moving together in tiny sideways steps, a dance of sorts.<br /><br /> The moment seemed to stretch for many minutes yet to take no time at all. I might have held my breath so little did I feel I belonged in their moment. During their shuffle-dance, I saw them looking into each other’s eyes the entire time. “Isn’t this funny?” their eyes said to each other. “I am the mother and you are the daughter, yet now I need your help - isn’t it funny how things have changed?” In their eyes in that brief exchange I saw a window that was open between them, and I saw laughter, and love, and acceptance, and memories, and understanding that this is what happens in life, that things change, that children grow up, that the child becomes the parent, that we do not control our fates, but we can still live, and love, and take it one moment at a time, because this is what it means to be human.<br /><br />This post appeared first on The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Image copyright (outer article): Engin_Akyurt/pixabay/CC0<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />J.

32	32	2	In cancer, there is no place for blame.	I recently read a post by oncologist Dr. Stephanie Graff on the experience of blame, from self and others, that people with cancer are subjected to.<br /><br /> Her post, The only perfect cancer statistic is an imperfect one, is a great resource for any of our patients who have experienced or are struggling with this.<br /><br /> Another type of blame we can see in oncology practice is when our patients' families worry that they somehow did not do enough to save their loved one.  They blame themselves for not going to more or different doctors or a different hospital or cancer center.  They second-guess a decision to accept hospice care.<br /><br /> With the inundation of media advertisements and news stories on new cancer treatments, there is a misconception that there is a treatment success for every cancer and situation.  I hope one day that is the reality, but it is not yet.<br /><br /> Some time ago I wrote a metaphorical letter about cancer and hospice to someone, in the hope to find a way to reassure him that he, his family, and his loved one's doctors, had truly done everything possible.  He told me it was helpful to him and so I thought I would use it as part of this post, in case it can be also helpful to others.  Here it is below (slightly altered from the original letter to protect privacy):<br /><br /> Dear Friend,<br /><br /> We raise our swords and drive the dragon back for as long as we can, but too often, even from the onset of the battle, we know we will not win, and ultimately it is the dragon which will be victorious.<br /><br /> Most of the time, we do not know when or why the dragon attacks, or how it chooses its victim.  We have limited weapons to battle the dragon.  Sometimes, our weapons succeed at first to drive the dragon back, and the dragon may even retreat fully from view.  But with no warning, it can return.  And when it does, to our dismay, it has evolved, so that the initial weapons that seemed successful now fall useless to the wayside.   <br /><br /> We grab in desperation for another weapon.  A cadre of our knights toil steadily to invent and make new weapons.  We learn that different dragons have different vulnerabilities.  We stock our arsenals.  There are some dragons who are easily weakened, and we can drive them back with each new weapon.  But with one eye we watch the ever shrinking arsenal, as we are aware with each weapon used, we get closer to the day when the arsenal will be depleted.  The dragon is ruthless, and cares not who its victims are.<br /><br /> It is at this point where the knight must drop his or her sword.  If the dragon cannot be stopped, what can be done to shore up the village?<br /><br /> It means that we know from our experience that this kind of dragon is too powerful.  We have learned from our past battles, and those of our mentors before us, that no human power can turn it back.  Hospice is the shield we place over the village.<br /><br /> So why go to battle at all, one might ask?  Perhaps because sometimes, we find something unexpected, a chink in the dragon’s scales; a weapon that did not work before suddenly weakens the next dragon.  It gives us hope.  We study the dragons.  We learn that some dragons have features that make them especially vulnerable to certain weapons, but not others.  We start saving more villages.  Villages everywhere feel more secure.  But even so, certain types of dragons remain immensely powerful.  Our weapons bounce off their scales like harmless droplets of rain.  There is no rhyme or reason as to why one kind of dragon visits one village, and a different one goes elsewhere.<br /><br /> This cancer was one of those worst-of-all dragons.  I think your loved one, and all of you, were exceptionally brave and you had the best knights fighting on your side.  I want you to know that there was nothing overlooked -- no better knight or secret weapon somewhere else that might have changed things.<br /><br /> We are but mortal.<br /><br /> (as Atul Gawande has written about in Being Mortal)<br /><br />  <br /><br />This post appeared first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />J.

33	32	2	The Prior Authorization Games: Where the Odds are Never in Your Favor	"The nonsensical denials would almost cause one to laugh, if not for the reality that each denial represents potential delay in care for the patient and redundant work for the physician -- work that expands exponentially from the initial time taken to submit a carefully-worded request (in the futile hope that one might receive an approval on the first try). The incredulous laughter at the absurdity of the denials turns quickly to lamentation as my inbox fills each week with more and more denials of prior authorization for reimbursement, which must be appealed.<br /><br /> Case #1.<br /><br /> I requested an MRI of the brain for a patient with a history of malignancy, now with new concerning neurological symptoms. The insurance company approved the MRI, but only WITHOUT gadolinium contrast. I had requested the MRI to be done WITH gadolinium contrast. Some nameless, faceless, person at the insurance company, who has never met my patient, and I am certain does not have a medical degree, dictated what kind of MRI that I could order. It seemed they were willing to concede the patient needed the MRI, but they wouldn’t approve it the way I, the physician, a board-certified medical oncologist, had ordered it. This degree of attempt at micromanagement of my medical care of my patient was jaw-dropping.<br /><br /> The letter indicated I could appeal the decision in writing. I was so upset at the ridiculous nature of the denial that I wrote a more forceful letter than is my typical approach. Here is an excerpt:<br /><br />""… I have ordered an MRI of the brain WITH contrast in order to evaluate the brain and meninges for any evidence of malignant involvement of the CNS. This is according to current standards of practice in oncology. For reasons that are entirely unclear and inexplicable to me, your company has approved only an MRI WITHOUT contrast. Without the use of contrast, the radiologist cannot adequately evaluate the brain and meninges. Please approve the MRI of brain WITH contrast ASAP so that we can properly take care of our patient.""<br /><br /> Less than 24 hours after I faxed the appeal letter, a response letter of approval was on my desk; for MRI -- WITH contrast.<br /><br /> While I was grateful for the patient’s sake that the approval turned around so quickly (not always the case -- sometimes these appeals drag on for weeks), I couldn’t help but reflect on the situation, that what it really comes down to is a deep lack of trust. The insurance company does not trust that I, as a physician board-certified in my specialty, know the best test to order for my patient. Why is that?<br /><br />Taking it one step further, if insurance companies can dictate what kinds of tests that we, as physicians, can order, why do we have a board-certification process to begin with?<br /><br /> I re-certified for both medical oncology and hematology within the past 1 year. It was a good opportunity to review changes in practice and provided the reassurance that I was up-to-date in my fields of specialty, and I have the certificates again to prove it (at least for the next 10 years). It was also a lot of work, expense, and time away from my practice. And for what? What good is being board certified in one’s specialty if someone without a medical degree is deciding what kind of tests will be reimbursed by insurance? If insurance companies trusted the board certification system (for medical specialties, the ABIM -- American Board of Internal Medicine), they wouldn’t second-guess our every radiology order, and make us submit “proof” of why we are ordering them on our patients. Isn't the ""proof"" in our medical degree, and our board certification? The only conclusion that can be drawn is that insurance companies do not trust that being licensed and board-certified in one’s specialty means a physician knows what s/he is doing.<br /><br /> The irony is, I try to put the information I know they will ask for in the original order and the clinic note that accompanies the order. I don’t think anyone with any medical knowledge reads it. The result being that I have to double my work and write a letter with the same information and submit an appeal to finally reach someone, we presume, with some medical knowledge, to “authorize” the test that the board-certified physician has already determined to be indicated. Like every physician I know, I am not given extra time in my clinic day to take care of these administrative tasks, so I am often doing them after clinic hours, on my “own” time.<br /><br /> Case #2<br /><br /> A patient with an upper extremity DVT (deep venous thrombosis) associated with an implanted portacath had completed a course of definitive chemotherapy, and we thus wanted to allow the surgeon to remove the portacath. I recommended a repeat ultrasound to make sure the anticoagulation (blood thinner) treatment had been effective against the blood clot, before the surgeon removed the portacath.<br /><br /> We received a notification of denial of prior authorization. The reason: this insurance company only authorizes repeat ultrasounds for lower extremity DVT for ONLY the following 2 criteria: (1) one week after diagnosis of the DVT, or (2) up to three times in the first 2 weeks if a DVT in the calf is not being treated.<br /><br /> My immediate thoughts on this as a board-certified hematologist were:<br /><br />  These criteria make no clinical sense for any DVT patient<br /><br />  They don’t even apply to my patient as the DVT is not even in his calf.<br /><br /> So again, I wrote the obligatory appeal letter. I explained in great detail where the blood clot was, what a portacath is, and the potential dangers of the surgeon removing the portacath if there was still a large blood clot at the tip of it. Based on the above success, I decided to take again a direct and forceful approach. Here is an excerpt:<br /><br />""…it would be most prudent to repeat the ultrasound BEFORE we remove the portacath, so that we make sure the DVT is resolved (so that we do not risk dislodging a piece of blood clot that could go to the lungs). Your company, however, has decided to deny coverage of a repeat ultrasound. I would ask that you please reconsider this most expeditiously.""<br /><br /> And reconsider it most expeditiously they did. Again, within 24 hours, I had a letter of approval on my desk. It seems that pointing out that their denial of the test could result in a potentially life-threatening consequence worked wonders in getting approval from the insurance company.<br /><br /> But again, I wished I didn’t have to go through this ludicrous process to get a clinically justifiable test approved.<br /><br /> Case #3<br /><br /> A tumor removed at surgery turned out to be a much higher stage than the preoperative testing had indicated. I recommended adjuvant chemotherapy.  (Adjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy given after surgery, to decrease the chance of cancer relapse in the future). However, to make sure we will not be exposing the patient to the risks of intensive chemotherapy inappropriately, I recommend a CT scan to make sure there is not already metastatic disease. (If there is metastatic disease, the chemotherapy cannot change that, and we would instead recommend chemotherapy treatments with less risk of toxicities, to palliate the metastatic disease, but balance side effects with quality of life).<br /><br /> The surgeon had ordered a CT scan prior to the surgery, but the insurance company had denied it. We re-ordered the scan urgently, with the hope to have results quickly, and scheduled the start of chemotherapy in one week.<br /><br /> We received a denial of reimbursement for the CT scan. This particular insurance company told us that they subcontracted this patient’s care to a subsidiary company. We contacted that company. They told us that, no, the parent insurance company is responsible for the decision on authorization. After one week of repeated calls to both companies, we still did not have an answer. We had to delay the start of chemotherapy. After 2 more days, we finally received an authorization.<br /><br /> If I did not have a medical assistant whose primary responsibility is to help obtain these prior authorizations, I would never have been able to take care of the numerous back and forth phone calls that were necessary to finally obtain the approval. No physician could do it alone. (note to self – remember to bring coffee tomorrow for my prior authorization specialist MA).<br /><br /> Is there any hope for the future?<br /><br /> I think so. I think physicians are starting to be heard. A workgroup led by the AMA recently released a statement of Prior Authorization and Utilization Management Reform Principles. I found an excellent summary on this blog post on medaxiom.com.<br /><br />On their website, the AMA states:<br /><br />""The AMA believes that prior authorization is overused and that existing processes are too difficult. … the AMA believes that prior authorization is a challenge that needs to be addressed through a multifaceted approach to reduce burdens on physicians and patients.""<br /><br /> Here are some more blog posts that I found to be good reads:<br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/opinion/adventures-in-prior-authorization.html<br /><br />http://gomerblog.com/2017/02/prior-authorization-eternity/<br /><br />http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/physicians-frustration-prior-authorizations-only-grows<br /><br />http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/content/tags/insurance-companies/prior-authorization-predicament?page=0,0<br /><br />http://www.physicianspractice.com/blog/obtaining-prior-authorization-three-success-strategies<br /><br />http://drmintz.blogspot.com/2012/05/prior-authorizations-suck.html<br /><br /> Epilogue:<br /><br /> Case #1: No CNS metastases<br /><br /> Case #2: Portacath removed successfully<br /><br /> Case #3: Patient able to start chemotherapy<br /><br /> These are just 3 examples of the 50+ patients I see in a week.

36	35	2	How Long will I Need to Wear a Brace for Better Result	Naturally, we have a lot of questions before starting a treatment programme.  And, when we go for braces, there is one of the common questions we get asked a lot: how long will I need to wear the braces?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The answer to this question is not always straight forward. It depends on the type of dental treatment and the brace you choose.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The first thing the patients need to know is that there is no definite time limitation in this treatment, because it depends completely on the condition of that individual’s teeth condition. How many teeth are to be treated, how much movement is needed, and finally the approach of the patient that how is teeth and the smile is going to look ; are the few basics which must be consulted with the dentist.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Braces: What Are the Options?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> There are four major types of braces. All these have different qualities, which are comfortable as well as affordable to the patients. <br /><br />  <br /><br />Damon Orthodontic Brace:<br />  Damon Orthodontic Braces do not require conventional elastic or metal ‘ties’, rather this includes a slide mechanism which helps the pressure of the teeth to diminish and allows to be treated more comfortably. A patient can use a clear brace or an orthodox metal for this treatment. This treatment requires 14-15 months.<br />   <br /><br />Lingual Orthodontic Braces:<br />  Lingual Orthodontic Braces are fixed and set behind our teeth. This type of brace actually does not visible to others as it is placed behind and this makes the patient to feel better psychologically. It takes approximately 180 to 270 days that is 6 to 9 months.<br />   <br /><br />Invisalign Braces:<br />  Invisalign braces are clear and removable and thus, it is well guarded and difficult to find out. This too can be taken off during eating or brushing. It also takes 6 to 9 months.<br />   <br /><br />Six Month Smile Braces:<br />  Six Month Smile Braces is one of the latest orthodontic treatments that moves your teeth into proper position in just an average of 6 months. This treatment is most suitable for them who want to have a faster result.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Different Braces have their different characteristics. Thus, it is very important to visit a specialist Orthodontist in London to discuss about this and get the best treatment and the desired treatment and smile.<br />Article last time updated on 26.02.2018.		2018-02-22 00:00:00	277	m2m
37	36	2	Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Cancer: What Are The Odds?	What are the odds of winning the lottery?<br /><br /> Driving along the streets of your town or city, or down the major or minor highways throughout America, you will eventually encounter a billboard encouraging you to buy a lottery ticket to win the fantastic sum of money invariably displayed on the sign. Billboards are not sufficient; radio and television advertising is commonly employed to solicit participation in state or national lotteries.  Once or twice a year the total in the lottery reaches hundreds of millions of dollars, and has even occasionally surpassed one billion dollars.  Amounts this large lead to local and sometimes national news broadcast reports to comment on the feeding frenzy of ticket purchases throughout the nation.<br /><br /> Apparently I am inured to the entreaties from outdoor advertising and other media outlets because I do not buy lottery tickets. I have nothing against lottery tickets; it is not a personal issue.  I am also not opposed to other individuals buying a lottery ticket.  I have occasionally seen a recent lottery winner on the local news holding a check the size of a door displaying a value of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.  I have never seen a single individual who won the lottery frowning, in fact they usually have a huge “I can’t believe this happened” grin on their face.<br /><br /> I don’t buy lottery tickets because I never think to buy one. When I fill my car with gasoline, like many people I pay at the pump so I don’t go into the ever present mini market associated with the gas station.  At grocery stores I am a man on a mission.  I like to make a list for the week, grab a cart on my way through the double sliding doors, and begin my trip up and down the rows of produce, bakery products, drinks, and food items deemed necessary for my family’s weekly dining needs.  Unless I start writing “buy a lottery ticket” on the weekly grocery list, I will not purchase a ticket because it is not on my radar.<br /><br /> What are the odds of winning one of the national big dollar lottery tickets? It is possible to calculate the odds and probabilities of winning hundreds of millions of dollars when intentionally choosing six specific numbers, which are no different from the odds if you allow the computer to pick the six numbers for you.  The odds range from approximately 1 in 100,000,000 to 1 in 280,000,000 to win.  In other words, if every man, woman, and child in the United States bought a lottery ticket twice a week, the odds suggest there should be one winner for each drawing based on our current population.  Obviously, not everybody buys lottery tickets, but some people do make up for those of us who are miscreants by buying more than one set of numbers.  I have a friend who admitted to me last year that he has been buying a lottery ticket every week for the last three years.  He explained, “If you don’t buy one, you won’t win.”  This is clearly a valid and correct statement, but not sufficient to influence me to begin buying tickets.  When I pressed him to explain his sudden interest in high stakes, low probability gambling, he reported a winning ticket would cause him to retire immediately from his job and live out his life playing golf, visiting his children, and traveling the world with his wife.<br /><br /> He is still working every day.<br /><br /> You never know, however. One day it may be his grinning face I see holding a door-sized check for outrageously large amounts of money.<br /><br />What are the odds of getting fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer?<br /><br /> As usual, I am contemplating seemingly tangential topics because I am thinking about a specific patient of mine. Once or twice a year I meet a young patient with a rare form of liver cancer.  This unusual liver malignancy is called fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer.  The fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular cancer is very rare.  There are only about 200 new cases of this type of cancer diagnosed worldwide every year.  If we estimate there are currently approximately 7.5 billion people in the world, this equates to 1 in 3,750,000 chance of being diagnosed with this unusual cancer.<br /><br /> The more common form of hepatocellular cancer is a significant public health problem worldwide. There are roughly one million new cases of hepatocellular cancer diagnosed annually around the world.  Unfortunately, the long-term survival probability in patients diagnosed with the common type of hepatocellular carcinoma is not good.  Less than 5% of patients diagnosed this year with hepatocellular cancer will still be alive five years from now.  The majority of patients with hepatocellular cancer have cirrhosis or some type of liver damage from chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection, alcohol abuse, exposure to substances toxic to the liver, or from genetic syndromes causing metabolic disorders leading to liver damage.  Patients with the common variant of hepatocellular cancer are usually diagnosed in their 50s, 60s, or 70s.<br /><br /> The fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular cancer is odd. Unlike garden variety hepatocellular cancer, almost all patients with this liver malignancy have normal, undamaged livers.  They rarely show any evidence of hepatitis B or C virus infection, and the average age of patients diagnosed with fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer is mid-20s.  I have seen patients as young as 13 years old, and the oldest patient I have personally seen after being diagnosed with this variant was 38 years old.  Patients with fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer often have large tumors recognized after they produce unexplained upper abdominal pain, or when the patient palpates a mass in their upper abdomen.  The majority of patients with the more common, aggressive form of hepatocellular cancer have elevation in a serum tumor marker called alpha fetoprotein, or AFP.  In contrast, fibrolamellar patients rarely have elevated blood levels of AFP.<br /><br /> The treatment offering the best chance for long-term survival in all types of hepatocellular cancer is complete surgical removal. Unfortunately, a very small percentage of patients with the common variety of hepatocellular cancer are candidates for surgical treatment because they have severely damaged liver that do not heal or regenerate normally after a partial liver resection.  Patients with early stage disease may be candidates for a liver transplant, but very few patients qualify for this option.  There is a marked paucity of organs available for transplant, so sadly many patients die while waiting on the list.  Patients with common hepatocellular cancer who have metastases to lymph nodes near the liver have a poor prognosis, and very few survive more than one or two years.  In contrast, regional lymph node metastases from the fibrolamellar type of liver cancer is not a contraindication to aggressive surgical treatment.  There are fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer patients who may survive for many years despite positive nodes, not dissimilar to the situation with other cancers like colon or breast cancer where lymph node metastasis can be treated successfully.<br /><br />The diagnosis<br /><br /> The patient on my mind was in her late 20s when she was diagnosed with fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer. She was living what she described as a happy life with her husband in a small town at a latitude far higher than the sub-tropical climate of southeast Texas, and was an active and energetic young woman.  She developed some difficulty eating and occasional pain after meals and noticed she was feeling less energetic than usual for her.  Not long after, she noticed a firm bulge in her upper abdomen.  She quickly made an appointment with her local physician who palpated a mass almost to the level of her umbilicus (belly button) and recognized this was likely associated with her liver.  Blood tests were obtained and her liver enzymes were elevated, and a subsequent CT scan revealed a tumor involving the entire left lobe of her liver and extending to the gallbladder in the right lobe of her liver.  This tumor was about the size of an extra-large Texas grapefruit.  The scan also revealed numerous enlarged lymph nodes behind the stomach and along the blood vessels leading to her liver.  A needle biopsy of the easily palpable liver mass was obtained revealing fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer.<br /><br /> As usual for patients with this disease, this young lady had no risk factors for liver cancer. Her serum AFP level was normal.  Scans of the lungs and all other areas showed no evidence of metastatic tumors beyond those in the lymph nodes near the liver.  She was referred to one of my medical oncology colleagues.<br /><br /> The patient’s information, CT scans, and biopsy material were reviewed at a multidisciplinary liver cancer conference. The large tumor was occluding some of the blood vessels going to the left lobe of the liver, causing obstruction of bile ducts on the left side of the liver, and was abutting the blood vessels and bile ducts to the right lobe of the liver.  It was decided surgical removal was not possible because of the location of the tumor.  My medical oncology colleague initiated an aggressive regimen of chemotherapy drugs over the next three months.  I met the patient and her family at the beginning of her chemotherapy treatments to introduce myself and to assure her I would follow her closely to consider surgical treatment if she showed reduction in the size of her liver tumor.<br />  <br /><br />“I know this is a big deal, but what other chance do I have?”<br /><br /> When I saw her after her three months of treatment, I was initially stunned. Chemotherapy had caused her to lose all of her hair, including her eyebrows and eyelashes.  She was wan, listless, and had dark circles under her eyes.  Chemotherapy had knocked her down and left her weakened.  Based on her appearance, I was concerned when I pulled up her new CT images I would be in for bad news and progression of her cancer.<br /><br /> My prediction based on her clinical appearance was incorrect. Her liver tumor was dramatically smaller and her tumor-bearing lymph nodes, which had been as large as 3-4 cm in diameter, were reduced to 2 cm in size.  The liver tumor was still impinging on the bile ducts and blood vessels to the left lobe of the liver and was near the right lobe blood vessels and ducts, but I judged we had an opportunity to remove the tumor with a negative margin.<br /><br /> I had a long conversation with the patient, her husband, and parents. When I mentioned surgery was possible, her father launched himself out of the seat and nearly knocked me off of the rolling stool in the examination room with an embrace.  There were cheers and tears in the room, and it took a few moments to restore some semblance of order to have a serious conversation describing the implications and impact of an operation for this young woman.  I explained the operation would require removal of the entire left lobe and a portion of the right lobe of her liver.  I would also remove all of the lymph nodes around the blood vessels going to her stomach and liver and these would be sent to our pathologists to evaluate.  I told them honestly the presence of lymph node metastases in fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer meant she had a lower probability of long-term survival and cure, but unlike other forms of liver cancer, this did not mean we had no chance of long-term success.<br /><br /> I ended the conversation with a ten minute diatribe regarding what I considered to be a mandatory accomplishment for me to perform an operation safely. The patient was already a slightly built young woman, and she had lost weight from nausea and malaise induced by her chemotherapy treatments.  Her nutritional and energy status was poor.  I had one of our nutritionists come into the room with me and we outlined techniques to increase her protein and calorie intake and to push herself with a daily walking program to overcome some of the chemotherapy-induced fatigue and malnutrition.<br /><br /> Three weeks later the patient reappeared the day before her scheduled operation. She was transformed.  She had gained almost seven pounds, she was downright peppy, and her smile was dazzling.  She informed me she had been eating like a proverbial horse and felt like she could be turned out to run with the horses in the field.  We had the perfunctory and required conversation about the expectations of an operation along with the potential risks and complications.  She listened intently to all I had to say, nodded once and said, “I know this is a big deal, but what other chance do I have?”<br /><br /> Playing the odds. The odds of her developing this cancer were unbelievably small, but here we were planning a major operation.  The next day I began what I predicted would be an approximately four hour long operation.  Instead it proved to be a six hour long operation.  The intraoperative ultrasound I performed revealed there was a tongue of tumor extending from the large mass in the left liver into the left portal vein and extending slightly into the right portal vein.  The operation included complete removal of the left lobe and part of the right liver where the gallbladder lies, and a reconstruction of the right portal vein where I extracted the tumor.  Tumor was also near the right bile duct so a portion of this was also removed to assure complete removal of the liver tumor.  The right bile duct was also reconstructed and a tube was placed into the duct.  All of the enlarged lymph nodes were removed and at the end of the operation, a frozen section analysis by our pathologist indicated all detectable tumor had been removed with negative margins.<br /><br />Life after surgery<br /><br /> Young patients often bounce back quickly from an operation and this lady was no exception. She was motivated and up walking the next day.  However, by the third day after her operation, it was clear she had developed jaundice with a yellow color to her eyes and skin.  Her blood tests revealed that her serum bilirubin level had risen.  The value continued to rise for two more days and then leveled off.  Notably, her pathology results came back showing significant killing of the tumor both in the lymph nodes and in the liver by her chemotherapy regimen, but the chemotherapy had also induced significant damage to the normal liver and had caused stasis, or precipitation and blockage, of bile in the microscopic bile ducts within the liver.  We performed scans and other tests and confirmed her bile duct to the right lobe of the liver was open and there was normal blood flow to the liver, but she had high levels of bilirubin in her blood.  She was walking, eating, and feeling well; she just had a yellow tint to her eyes and skin.<br /><br /> After I worried about this abnormal blood test for several more days, she insisted I discharge her because she was “bored.” I couldn’t argue with her as I was performing no active interventions on her and her liver function blood tests, including the bilirubin, had stabilized, albeit at an abnormal level.  I didn’t realize it then, but this was to be her new set point.  When I saw this young lady back in the office a week later, the blood levels of bilirubin had not changed.  She was eating and feeling well and had decided she was not going to take any additional chemotherapy because of the severe toxicities she had endured with the initial treatment.  I was concerned about her abnormal liver blood tests results, so I asked her to get blood work drawn by her physician in her home town every two weeks and send those results to me.<br /><br /> She dutifully complied and results arrived on my fax machine every other Friday. No change in the results, no improvement and no worsening.  I saw her back three months after she was discharged from the hospital and a CT scan revealed her liver had regenerated nicely and there was no evidence of recurrent cancer in the liver, lymph nodes, or other sites.  She felt well, had returned to normal activities, and simply looked like she had too much spray on bronzing agent applied.  We discussed this at length and decided to watch.  A few months later the patient developed a fever.  She traveled south and we saw her in the office.  Her liver blood tests were no different but her white blood cell count was elevated, indicating a possible infection.  A CT scan was obtained which demonstrated a new collection of fluid adjacent to the blood vessels and bile duct at the base of her liver.  I arranged for one of our interventional radiologists to put a tube into this fluid and the result was drainage of an infected collection of bile.  We placed her on appropriate antibiotics and her fever and infection cleared rapidly.  I wondered if placement of this tube might lead to a change in her serum bilirubin levels, but this was not to be.  We also followed closely to check for any recurrence of cancer.  We could find none based on the CT scans.  Our radiologist did a study through the drain and realized there was a small bile duct along the edge of the liver that was open and her main right bile duct was scarred, but open.  We decided to leave the drain in until bile leak from the liver resolved.  Unfortunately, that never happened.<br /><br /> I continued to see this lady every three months for the next several years and slowly increased the intervals to every four and then every six months. During the first five years after her extensive liver operation, her skin and eye color never changed.  She did occasionally develop occlusion of the small drain tube exiting from her abdominal wall, and this problem was always resolved by exchanging the clogged tube for a new one.  She was happy when she reached the five-year survival mark after removal of her fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer because she had been told by her medical oncologists the presence of the lymph node metastasis portended a five-year survival probability of less than forty percent.<br /><br /> I always looked forward to visits by this lady and her family. I quickly learned to walk into the room and immediately announce there were no changes on her scans and no evidence of recurrent cancer.  The entire entourage would collectively breathe a sigh of relief, and we would spend the next fifteen minutes talking about events, family trips, or other important life happenings.  Despite her medical issues and a chronic external biliary drainage tube, this young lady was always involved in helping other people in her community and church, and always asked about me and my family.  She was thoughtful, considerate, and as many of the trainees who worked with me over the years observed, “A really nice person.”<br />  <br /><br />Stroke of fate #2<br /><br /> This routine went on for almost a decade. Unfortunately, we reached a tipping point.  She began to develop problems with anemia, low platelet counts, and intermittent bleeding from her intestinal tract.  CT scans revealed large dilated blood vessels around her entire upper abdomen, a situation called varices.  This indicated the pressure in her liver was high, portal hypertension, and a manifestation of this high venous pressure was dilated blood vessels throughout her abdominal cavity and intestinal system.  Her spleen was enlarged and platelets were being consumed, she was anemic from chronic blood loss from the dilated veins in her stomach and intestines.  As this situation evolved, she began requiring transfusions of blood or platelets.  Slowly, her liver function worsened.  Her serum bilirubin levels, which had been stable for years in the high single digit range rose into the teens and into the low twenties.  Her skin turned from a bronze color to pumpkin and finally a bright yellow hue.  She had survived for over eight years after a diagnosis of advanced fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer, but her liver was failing.  At no point could I detect any evidence of recurrent or metastatic cancer; the combination of the toxic effects from the chemotherapy drugs she received combined with a major liver operation conspired to cause slow but progressive damage to her liver.<br /><br /> She was in her early 40s and otherwise healthy and apparently cancer-free, so I referred her to my colleagues in the liver transplant program. They performed an extensive evaluation and agreed she was an excellent candidate for a transplant.  She went through the exhaustive pre-transplant testing and was placed onto the waiting list.<br /><br /> Eventually the day came when she and her family got the call a suitable donor liver had been found. She came into the hospital and I saw her, her husband, and her family in the surgical holding area.  She was appropriately anxious.  I wished her well, and promised to visit her daily during her hospitalization.<br /><br /> That was the final conversation I had with her. A few hours later my transplant surgery colleagues called me from the operating room.  They had encountered an absolute viper’s nest of massively dilated, high pressure veins in and around the liver.  She was bleeding vigorously from numerous areas and control of the active bleeding was difficult to maintain.  The transplant team finally decided to pack her with sterile gauze pads to hold pressure in an attempt to stabilize her in the intensive care unit.  Unfortunately, over the course of the next several hours her liver, kidney, heart, and lung function deteriorated rapidly.  I had long conversation with the patient’s husband and parents and informed them she had developed multiple organ failure.  This patient had very direct conversations and understanding with her family about end of life issues.  She had told them in no uncertain terms she did not wish to be maintained on medications and machines, and it was clear that was the situation we found ourselves in.  It is an appalling and painful conversation to have with a patient or their family members, but we discussed her wishes.  Everyone agreed she did not want to be on the numerous high dose medications and a ventilator to maintain her blood pressure, heart, and lung function, and she would certainly not want kidney dialysis or other extraordinary means at this point.  The decision was made not to withdraw any care, and to maintain her on high doses of pain medication to assure she was comfortable, but we did not escalate, and over the next few hours she quietly and peacefully slipped away.<br /><br /> I don’t like attending funerals, but I was at hers. Some can be morbid events.  Hers was not.  It was sad, but it was also a celebration of her spirit and the joy she exhibited in her life.  I watched this lady over a dozen years bravely manage and enjoy a busy life despite toxic effects of chemotherapy and a major surgical operation.  She lived with a plastic tube extruding from her abdominal wall.  She was not a victim, she was a victor.  She embraced and loved her family and her life, and was always ready and willing to help others.  She epitomized unselfish, giving behavior by providing care for others heedless of her needs.  She walked the walk.<br /><br /> She was a young patient vexed by an extremely rare cancer which we don’t understand and which she did nothing to cause. The lottery of life odds of her getting this cancer were incomprehensibly low, but she never demonstrated a, “Why me?” attitude.  She had a happy soul who went out of her way to be helpful and kind to other people.  I admire the positive spirit she and other cancer patients and family members exhibit every day as they survive and deal with the emotional and physical effects of the disease and our treatments.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Hermann/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 20.02.2018.

38	36	2	Side Effects Related To Cancer Therapies	Personalized cancer therapy – What’s all the buzz about?<br /><br /> We live in a remarkable time of advances in science and medicine. The human genome has been sequenced and mapped. Materials and drugs on a nanoscale are being designed and developed to treat cancer, infectious diseases, and other human medical conditions. The usually numerous genetic abnormalities present in the cancer from any given patient can now be measured and described, and at times, even acted upon if a specific genetic or cellular pathway abnormality is present matching a drug known to improve killing of cancer cells with that specific mutation or aberration. <br /><br /> Until recently, biopsies of tumors were a process involving surgery or needles placed under ultrasound or some other type of radiologic guidance; we are now entering an era of “liquid biopsies”. Cancer cells shed from solid tumors at a variety of locations in the body can be detected in the blood, collected, and studied. Snippets of DNA circulating in the blood released from cancer cells can also be measured, and may serve as easier and more rapid ways to make a diagnosis of a specific type of cancer, to determine appropriate treatments, and to follow patients who have completed treatment to monitor for recurrence of malignant disease.<br /><br /> Personalized (also called precision) cancer therapy is currently a popular buzz phrase in the oncology community. Unfortunately, personalized therapy has not been adequately characterized or defined.  Most patients want this phrase to imply they will receive a truly unique treatment for their particular malignant disease. This represents disreality and sometimes, disinformation. The average cancer, despite the organ of origin, contains dozens of mutations, deletions, or alterations in the genes. This does not account for the many other variations occurring in epigenetics, which are changes caused by modifications in expression or activity in other genes rather than abnormalities in the genes themselves. Cancer represents a cascade of genetic and molecular events that conspire to produce an autonomous collection of cells, out of control and able to reproduce and spread to other areas.<br /><br /> If you take one hundred patients with a given specific cancer diagnosis, say stage III colon adenocarcinoma, meaning a malignant tumor in the colon spread to lymph nodes near the tumor, the majority will get identical treatment involving surgical removal of the affected section of colon including the regional lymph nodes, followed by six months of standard adjuvant chemotherapy. Certainly, major advances have been made in understanding whether or not a colon cancer has a finding called microsatellite instability or not, and it is possible to perform other basic studies which may be useful in predicting response to chemotherapy drugs or prognosis. Some patients may have a “targeted” agent added to the chemotherapy agents based on the presence or absence of a few specific genetic findings. These targeted agents are stunningly expensive and are not without risks or side effects. Nonetheless, here we are almost twenty years into the new millennium and most patients are not candidates for novel or targeted approaches to treat their cancer.<br /><br />Grade III and IV toxicities<br /><br /> I do not bemoan the state of modern multidisciplinary cancer therapy. I am exhilarated by the potential over the next several decades to move finally toward more individualized treatment options. We are simply not there yet. For the time being we still perform a logical series of investigative steps for new drugs leading to the holy grail of the academic investigator; the randomized controlled clinical trial. This produces so called level I evidence indicating a new drug or combination of drugs improves the survival probability of patients by some usually small, single digit percentage. Home runs, represented by a major (20% or more) improvement in long-term survival probability of patients receiving a novel therapeutic approach are rare. A multitude of cancer drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration when clinical trials of hundreds or thousands of patients demonstrated an only 2-5% increase in survival probability. Usually at a cost of short- and long-term side effects, and occasionally even a few patient deaths caused by the treatment itself.<br /><br /> I am disturbed when I attend oncology meetings and hear physicians speaking dispassionately about the grade III or IV toxicity rates associated with a particular study drug. Grade III and IV toxicities are troubling, potentially dangerous, and more severe side effects with significant impact on patients’ daily quality of life. I was at a multidisciplinary oncology meeting recently where three consecutive speakers spoke about novel cytotoxic or immunotherapies which produced grade III or IV toxicities in “only” about 20% of patients treated. They were seemingly pleased with what they considered to be a low rate of severe problems, and quickly moved to point out the drugs increased survival time by almost six months. I wonder how the one out of every five patients who suffered those temporary or permanent life-altering side effects felt about the “low toxicity rate”?  We are all intent on ridding the patient of their malignant disease and pulling out all the stops to extend survival, but I fear we not infrequently forget the impact of our therapies.<br /><br />Return of a former patient<br /><br /> I saw a patient in clinic last month who is an interesting and strange combination of a cancer treatment success story but also a cautionary tale. I recognized the name when I saw it on my clinic list, but couldn’t immediately place a face or a story to him. He was coming to see me as a new patient. He was referred to me with a diagnosis simply stated as “liver cancer”. I walked into the examination room, and a slightly built, thin gentleman in his late 60s rose slowly from the chair. He smiled and greeted me, asking, “Do you remember me, Doc?” He certainly looked familiar and as I swept the dusty corridors of my memory files, I suddenly realized I did know this man. However, he had aged markedly since I had last seen him. I grasped his shoulder with my left hand and enthusiastically pumped his right hand. I asked him to take a seat and I opened with a very general question, “What is going on?”<br /><br /> He spoke for the next ten minutes and laid out the amazing and harrowing medical journey he had traveled since I last saw him. My history with this gentleman began over twenty-five years ago when he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the right side of his colon. I removed the tumor-bearing section of colon and because it had spread to two of the lymph nodes near the primary cancer, he received six months of the standard adjuvant chemotherapy at the time; two drugs called 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Leucovorin. This man worked in machine shops and around oil drilling rigs throughout Texas and offshore in the Gulf Coast so he was outdoors in the sun frequently. He developed significant blistering of his exposed skin from enhanced sun sensitivity related to the 5-FU treatments. Nonetheless, he endured the treatments and returned to his normal life and duties.<br /><br /> I lost track of him after the colon operation until 2001. He didn’t want to take time off from work to travel to the big city. He had gone almost nine years without any evidence of cancer until his medical oncologist noted a slight rise in a serum tumor blood test; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). A perfunctory CT scan revealed a solitary metastasis at the edge of the right lobe of the liver. He was referred to return back to see me for surgical treatment. After we completed a thorough diagnostic evaluation, I performed a segmental resection to remove the single tumor which required removing less than 10% of his normal liver volume. At the time I noted his liver was quite normal in appearance. This gentleman was a smoker, admitting he smoked at least two packs of cigarettes a day while on the job, but he was not a heavy drinker. As he put it to me, he enjoyed an occasional glass of wine when he took his wife out for dinner or a beer at a ball game. He certainly had no evidence of any liver damage or abnormalities other than the single liver metastasis.<br /><br />“I’m still around, Doc!”<br /><br /> This gentleman returned to his hometown in central West Texas and received an additional six months of chemotherapy with his local medical oncologist. This included a drug relatively new at the time. We have subsequently learned this drug can produce damage to the liver by inducing a condition called steatohepatitis, literally fatty inflammation of the liver. Any drug or agent causing damage and inflammation to the liver can produce cirrhosis of the liver. Excess alcohol intake inflames the liver leading to cirrhosis, certain chemicals can cause liver damage, and worldwide chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus causes liver inflammation, damage, cirrhosis, and an increased risk to develop primary hepatocellular cancer.<br /><br /> I am foreshadowing here. This gentleman had never returned to see me after his operation in 2001. He explained when he returned recently he was too busy working rigs offshore and throughout different areas of Texas. I had not seen him in over fifteen years. He had aged dramatically during those years and was diagnosed with three new different cancers. First, in 2004 he developed a cough and a chest X-ray revealed a tumor in his upper right lung. A biopsy confirmed primary lung cancer so he underwent surgical removal of the upper lobe followed by six months of another chemotherapy cocktail. Sadly, despite developing a cigarette-induced cancer, he did not stop smoking. In 2010 his wife, also a smoker, developed an aggressive lung cancer and rapidly succumbed. Before she passed away, she mentioned to him, “Your voice is hoarse and scratchy, what is wrong with you?”<br /><br /> After burying his wife, he went to see his oncologist who referred him to a head and neck surgical specialist. A squamous cancer of the vocal cords was diagnosed. He underwent more chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When I saw him last month he had a voice that sounded like Joe Cocker after smoking several packs of cigarettes. This was his new normal. He reported his mouth was constantly dry from radiation therapy. He had difficulty swallowing and he always had the worst case of “cotton mouth” he could imagine. I recalled he was always a wiry gentleman, but he was now emaciated related to his difficulties with dry mouth and swallowing.<br /><br /> Dutifully, this gentleman went to see his medical oncologist and he performed various screening studies. One of these included measurement of tumor marker for prostate cancer called a prostate specific antigen, or PSA.  In 2014 this blood value was significantly elevated.  Further diagnostics studies and biopsies revealed prostate cancer. The patient underwent more radiation therapy to the prostate gland and the serum PSA value returned to normal. However, as a side effect of the radiation therapy he developed significant radiation proctitis, meaning inflammation of the lining of the rectum, manifest as frequent bleeding with bowel movements and severe pain upon defecation.<br /><br /> As he recounted all of these events and interventions, I sat quietly, occasionally shaking my head in disbelief and incredulity at what he had endured. I tried to put a positive spin on things when I told him, “You are a remarkable guy. Here you are alive and kicking over 25 years after your original cancer diagnosis.”<br /><br /> He rapidly and quietly deflated my congratulatory attempt when he stated, “You guys keep trying to poison me with drugs and radiation, but I’m still around, Doc.”<br /><br />Can chemotherapy drugs cause liver damage?<br /><br /> A clear understanding was reached without further comment from either of us. He is alive, but he paid a high price because of his personal choices and addiction to cigarettes causing lung and vocal cord cancer, and because of the numerous cancer treatments to control and eradicate his malignant tumors while damaging normal tissues and organs. I proceeded to ask about his current situation. He reported he developed right upper abdominal pain just before the new year and his oncologist had obtained a CT scan. Two new tumors were present in his liver, and his oncologist was surprised to discover he had clear evidence of cirrhosis of the liver. The patient’s liver was shrunken in size and had a crenelated appearance consistent with the usual cobblestone scarring of a damaged liver. He also had dilated venous blood vessels, called varices, denoting increased pressure in the portal venous system of the liver. A biopsy of one of the tumors revealed hepatocellular cancer. This gentleman had no evidence of hepatitis of B or C virus infection on additional blood tests, and was not a heavy alcohol drinker. When I pressed him for additional information, he readily admitted he worked around numerous types of toxic chemicals during his long career, but he asked an incisive question, “Could the chemotherapy drugs have caused damage to my liver?”<br /><br /> A reasonable question for which I had no definitive answer, but I did inform him it was possible. The liver is the organ that breaks down or metabolizes all drugs and medications we deliver to patients either as tablets or through intravenous drips. Chemotherapy drugs by definition are toxic compounds and injury and inflammation to the liver is a potential outcome. This man had also spent a career working with industrial solvents and chemicals known to produce liver damage.  The liver damage leading to cirrhosis in my patient was not from the common causes of hepatitis B or C virus infection or alcohol abuse, but was likely multifactorial in nature. Chemotherapy drugs are one of those factors.<br /><br />Microwave thermal ablation<br /><br /> The malignant tumors in this man were in the right lobe of his liver. Based on location within the right lobe, I knew it would require removal of over 65% of his liver. I was aware such a significant resection of volume in this man with relatively advanced cirrhosis would produce lethal liver failure. Fortunately, a complete workup to detect any evidence of metastasis of the liver cancer to other areas in the body was negative. Therefore, I performed a less invasive operation using two small incisions each 1cm in size. Through one incision just above the belly button I placed an operating laparoscope which provides magnified images of all of the organs in the peritoneal cavity. Through the second incision I placed a laparoscopic ultrasound probe to identify and locate the malignant tumors. I was then able to pierce the skin with a microwave ablation needle and use the ultrasound probe to guide placement of the needle into each tumor. The microwave equipment was activated and at the completion of this treatment, both tumors and a surrounding zone of the liver had been destroyed. He tolerated this operation without any complications or difficulty and was discharged home two days later.<br /><br /> One of his tumors was at the surface of the far right lobe stretching the liver capsule. This was likely the cause of his initial pain and discomfort leading him to seek attention with his local physician. Happily, after the microwave thermal ablation, the pain related to the liver tumor abated within a few days.<br /><br /> I saw this man back in my clinic recently for his first post-operative checkup. When I asked him how he was feeling, he replied with a smile and a wink, “I feel all stretched out.” Prior to the operation I had described the technique of a laparoscopic surgical procedure, which includes distending the abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide gas to permit better visualization of all of the organs and structures. It does stretch the abdominal wall a bit, and most patients have some soreness of their abdominal wall for a few days. This man entered dangerous territory when he looked at the female medical assistant with me in the room and told her, “Now I know what pregnancy feels like.”<br /><br /> The medical assistant has been through two pregnancies and full term deliveries of healthy babies. With what can only be described as a sneer and a look of pure disgust, she retorted, “I don’t think so.” I quickly suggested to my patient he refrain from comparing a brief laparoscopic operation to a nine-month pregnancy or be faced with open derision and possible physical harm. He laughed, the medical assistant shook her head, rolled her eyes, and uttered a single word, “Men!”<br /><br />More effective and less toxic therapies<br /><br /> Over a quarter of a century this man has developed, and so far survived, five different distinct types of cancer. He has now lived over fifteen years after being diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. He developed colon cancer at a relatively young age, and with his panoply of cancers he deserves a thorough genetic evaluation. He is directly responsible for at least two of his cancers, lung and the vocal cord, thanks to decades of smoking cigarettes. All of his cancers may be related to environmental factors and exposure to potentially toxic substances. I cannot exclude chemotherapy as at least a partial cause of his liver injury and resultant cirrhosis. Hepatocellular cancer can be very aggressive and has a high rate of recurrence. This man has survived four previous cancers, only time will tell how he does following treatment of the fifth. Importantly, this patient accepts full responsibility for behaviors causing some of his malignant disease, but he is openly disheartened and adversely impacted by chronic side effects related to his cancer therapies. He has chemotherapy-induced hearing loss requiring high decibel conversations and numbness in his hands and feet that prevent him from doing the woodworking he once loved as a hobby. He has dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, rectal pain, and bleeding because of damage caused by ionizing radiation treatments. He looks much older than his chronologic age, and he walks stooped and slowly like someone worn out by a hard life.<br /><br /> There are many chronic medical disorders that cause pain and disability in patients. Cancer patients are no different; however, at times our treatments incite chronic symptoms that affect our patients negatively. We must all be committed to finding more effective and less toxic therapies for patients diagnosed with cancer, and we must emphasize and support research to prevent the development of malignant disease. It is a noble and always worthwhile mission.<br /><br /> If we are not willing to make some tough decisions personally and publicly and do the right things to promote healthier lifestyles, we will falter in our battles with cancer. The consequences to individuals who develop cancer, and to all of us as a society, are too great and too dire to ignore and deflect any longer.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />leesean/flickr/CC BY-SA <br />Article last time updated on 30.01.2018.

39	36	2	I’ll Play This Hand	Meet the cowboy<br /><br /> He had read the look of consternation in my eyes. Not a difficult task; I am not adept at forcing an emotionless facial facade. I sat down on the rolling stool in the room, and the cowboy sat down between his two sons. “Get ready boys, the Doc has some news for us.”<br /><br /> The cowboy is in his early eighties. He is the real deal. He has worked on ranches throughout Texas, the western United States, and Alberta, Canada for over sixty years. When he stood to greet me, he was wearing a pair of faded blue dungarees, a long sleeve patterned western shirt, lizard cowboy boots, and a sweat-stained black cowboy hat with the front and back brim pulled down low. The hat featured a turquoise-encrusted leather hatband with a large feather protruding jauntily from the right side. The feather is a turkey feather. I asked him about the feather when I first met him eighteen months ago. He explained his nickname since he was a teenager is “Turkey.” The cowboy is six feet four inches tall and weighs about 160 pounds. He has a long neck and protruding Adam’s apple. He earned his nickname as a young man riding in rodeos when other cowboys would tease him telling him he looked like a turkey astride a horse. The cowboy had chuckled and informed me the nickname got him into plenty of fist fights as a young man, but he had finally decided it was more gracious and easier on his knuckles to accept the sobriquet and celebrate it. The finishing piece of the cowboy’s apparel was an engraved leather belt with a large silver and gold buckle denoting one of his many wins in rodeos in years gone by.<br /><br /> When I first met the cowboy a year and half ago, I noticed the buckle he wore that day (the buckle changed at every subsequent visit), and asked him about his rodeo experience. He nonchalantly informed me he had won hundreds of buckles, saddles, hats, and “occasionally a little money” in rodeos throughout the western United States and Canada. He had competed in almost every rodeo event including bulldogging (also known as steer wrestling), calf roping (as both a header and heeler), bull riding, but his specialty was bronco busting. He called it “bronc bustin’.” He had also ridden cutting horses, shot from the saddle at targets, and had worked plenty of arenas as a pick up rider. He had told me briefly about his rodeo days in a calm and non-boasting fashion. When he finished, his two sons, who were present every time he came to see me, proudly informed me their father was one of the best bucking horse riders of his era.<br /><br /> The cowboy’s response was to wink at me and say, “Hell, Doc, it was no big deal.”<br /><br />From chronic hepatitis C virus infection to cirrhosis<br /><br /> The cowboy’s primary care physician referred him to me to treat a primary liver cancer. The doctor from a small town in central Texas had followed the cowboy for a hepatitis C virus infection that was diagnosed over a decade ago when some routine liver blood tests were abnormal. The cowboy has a variety of black ink tattoos on both of his arms and across his back and chest. He had obtained these over a period of many years in various towns and cities across the country. He had never used drugs of any type, but did admit to “a fair amount of hard drinking” in bars and honky-tonks throughout the west. He also admitted to spending a few nights in county lock ups after “brawlin’, bustin’ up some chairs, and breakin’ a few noses” in bar fights. He had suffered numerous injuries working as a cowboy, but never required a blood transfusion. The cowboy probably acquired his chronic hepatitis C virus infection from an unclean needle used during one of his tattoo sessions, but it is impossible to know exactly how long he had carried the asymptomatic infection.<br /><br /> As it frequently does, the chronic hepatitis C virus infection had ultimately produced damage to his liver. A decade ago he was diagnosed with early stage cirrhosis. When the hepatitis C virus was diagnosed, the cowboy went through a year of treatment with interfon, a medication injected several times weekly to eradicate the virus. The treatment is not uniformly effective, and is associated with significant side effects. He suffered through the year of treatment silently and stoically, but confessed to me that one of the happiest days of his life was the day he received his last interfon injection. Fortunately, the drug had done its work and the virus disappeared from his blood. But the damage to his liver was already done, so his local doctor had dutifully been following him with annual visits and blood tests. Cirrhosis is an insidious disease and can worsen over time, and cirrhosis related to chronic hepatics B or C virus infection increases the risk to develop hepatocellular cancer (HCC).<br /><br />“Hell Doc, just cut the damn thing out.”<br /><br /> The local physician measured the cowboy’s serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) yearly. Eighteen months ago the AFP level was elevated for the first time. The doctor ordered a computed tomography (CT) scan which revealed a tumor in the left liver with the classic radiographic appearance of HCC. The family medicine physician consulted with an oncologist in the region who instructed him to refer the cowboy to me.<br /><br /> When I first met the cowboy, he was wearing the same hat. As a sign of respect, he doffed the hat revealing a full head of long, wavy silver hair to match his lamb chop side burns and bushy mustache. This was also the first of several bruising handshakes I received from this lean, strong man. When I met with him and his sons, we reviewed his CT images. He had a 3 cm tumor in the lateral aspect of the left lobe of his liver. The CT scans also revealed an irregular, shrunken, and cobbled contour of his liver consistent with his known cirrhosis. However, his liver function blood tests were normal and he had never had any of the serious clinical sequela associated with cirrhosis, including bleeding from dilated veins in the intestinal tract (varices), encephalopathy (severe mental confusion), or ascites (build up of fluid in the belly cavity). The CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no evidence of metastatic disease from his primary liver cancer, so we discussed surgical removal of the tumor. I discussed other HCC therapeutic options including chemotherapy, injection of mixtures of chemotherapy drugs and particles into the blood vessels going into the liver tumor to block, or “embolize” the blood vessels to starve the tumor of nutrients and oxygen, injection of radioactive particles into the tumor, and even liver transplant. Patients with early stage HCC confined to the liver may be considered for liver transplant if the tumor is not growing into major blood vessels. A liver transplant is a major undertaking, and being over eighty years old the cowboy was not interested in this option, and frankly would probably not have been a candidate. After patiently listening to me list treatment options, he made a quick conversation-ending decision when he stated, “Hell Doc, just cut the damn thing out.”<br /><br /> Clear direction was provided. Two weeks after I met the cowboy, he underwent a straightforward operation to remove a small section of the liver bearing the malignant tumor. In patients with cirrhosis, hepatobiliary surgeons must be cautious about the amount of liver we resect because the risk of post-operative liver failure is much higher. Fortunately, it was possible to remove less than 20% of this man’s liver, and he recovered uneventfully and without complication.<br /><br />Return of the tumor<br /><br /> I followed the cowboy in our clinic every three months after the operation. I had informed him and his sons the pathology results from his HCC revealed growth of malignant cells into microscopic blood vessels around the cancer, indicating a higher risk to have subclinical, undetectable metastasis somewhere in his body. He faithfully returned every three months for follow up blood tests and a CT scan. When I saw him a few weeks ago, I was immediately concerned when I noticed his serum AFP level, which had returned to a normal value after the liver resection, was again elevated. I opened his CT images on the computer and quickly learned why the AFP was abnormal. The cowboy had four or five sub-centimeter tumor nodules in each lung, and a new tumor in both adrenal glands, none of which were present on the CT three months prior.<br /><br /> As he sat between his two sons at our most recent visit, I explained the findings on his CT images. I reported his AFP blood test was again elevated, indicating HCC had metastasized to his lungs and adrenal glands. He inquired about the normal role of the adrenal glands, which I explained in terms he found acceptable. He slowly turned his head and wordlessly nodded to each of his sons, and then turned back to me. Making direct eye contact he stated, “I’ve had a helluva life Doc. I think I’m just gonna play this hand out.“<br /><br /> I understood his meaning. After his liver operation we again discussed chemotherapy and its side effects, and he responded by making a sour face. I informed the cowboy I would be happy to see him at regular intervals if he desired. He was taken aback and asked why I would do that since I would not be operating on him again. I indicated that oncology physicians follow their patients even during end of life periods in order to provide assistance, medication, or other support for symptoms or problems that may arise. He thoughtfully stroked his mustache, stood up, and offered a final handshake. “Thank you, Doc.  I’ll call you if I need you.”<br /><br />Enjoy the rest of your life, cowboy!<br /><br /> I respect the cowboy’s decision. He lived a rough and tumble life in the outdoors and is a happy and content man. I always enjoyed clinic days when I saw he was on my schedule because I was assured twenty minutes or so of tales about life in the saddle in rodeos and on ranches. I will miss those stories. But, I stand ready to assist the cowboy and any other patient I care for regardless of their status, even if all of our treatments have failed to halt the recurrence and progression of their cancer. I also understand and accept those who eschew surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or other treatments producing side effects and risks.<br /><br /> I ushered the cowboy out of the exam room and he walked steadily down the hall and out the clinic exit door. One of his sons followed, and one intentionally lingered. As father and son walked through the door, he turned, smiled, shook my hand, and thanked me for my care. He informed me he would call me when his father’s time on earth had passed, and also assured me he would call if his father had any symptoms or problems requiring my intervention. He turned and walked out the door.<br /><br /> Enjoy your remaining time in the saddle cowboy. None of us knows for certain when we’re going to be bucked off for the last time.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Free-Photos/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 28.11.2017.

40	36	2	The Snap Of A Glove	Humans engage in numerous types of repetitive, rote, and semi-conscious activities every day. Some may teeter close to the edge of the subliminal if the activity has been repeated so often it does not register in your conscious thoughts. I can think of many examples. For instance, when driving your automobile on a multiple lane road or highway, well-trained drivers reflexly flick their left or right turn signal to indicate an intention to change lanes. The exception to this unconscious signal occurs regularly in Texas when drivers of large extended-cab or “Duelie” (two back wheels on each side) pickup trucks switch rapidly across one or more traffic lanes without a turn signal indicating their intent. Apparently, pickup trucks and their drivers are exempt from this common sense and common courtesy maneuver. I apologize, I digress into editorializing. I warrant if any of us were to make a concerted effort to pay attention to every automatic task we perform during a given day, we would be surprised at the number of episodes that don’t register in our stream of consciousness.<br /><br />About awareness and habits<br /><br /> A specific event led me down the trail thinking about repetitive activities. Every time I perform a surgical operation, I wash my hands for several minutes at a scrub sink outside the operating room. After rinsing the soapsuds off my arms, I enter the operating suite and the scrub nurse or tech hands me a sterile towel to dry my hands and arms. They then hold out a sterile surgical gown and I place my arms through the two holes while the circulating nurse ties the back of the gown. The scrub nurse offers a sterile surgical glove for my right hand with the opening stretched wide. I slide my hand into the glove, and with a snap he or she releases the glove to clamp down over my surgical gown. I grasp the edge of the left glove with my gloved right hand, and the second glove is extended up my arm and snapped in place. Because I double glove, I’m guaranteed four snaps of the glove every time I scrub into an operation. For reasons I cannot ascertain, three weeks ago, for the first time in over two decades, the snap of the glove entered into my sentient mind.<br /><br /> A dangerous situation, this led to musings about awareness and habits. After pondering for a few minutes, I realized the snap of a glove in the operating room for me is akin to the starter’s pistol for a runner or swimmer. The snap brings me into total focus on the task at hand, the operation to be performed. I am locked, loaded, and prepared to engage the malignant disease affecting my patient. I had become so accustomed to the snap of the gloves the significance was relegated to a subconscious, yet still important place.<br /><br /> Including my general surgery residency, surgical oncology fellowship, and years as a faculty surgical oncologist, I have performed over 8,000 operations. That is more than 16,000 glove snaps over the course of my career.  Actually, it is a few thousand more because I routinely “break scrub” (move away from the sterile surgical field and remove my sterile gown and gloves) during the case to stroll with the surgical specimen to the frozen section laboratory to look through a microscope at slides of the resected tumor with a pathologist. We check to assure the resection margins are free of tumor to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in the surgical bed. After confirming that complete resection of the malignant tumor has been achieved, I scrub my hands again and return to the operating room to repeat the gowning and the double gloving procedure. The operation must be completed!<br /><br />The origin of surgical gloves<br /><br /> Thoughtfully, I realize the snap of the glove is a reassuring sound I have heard thousands of times. It is a poignant moment indicating the surgical and anesthesia teams are ready, the patient is prepped and ready to be draped with sterile towels, and the planned operation is to begin imminently. The wearing of sterile surgical gowns and gloves, along with caps and masks to cover our hair and face is a tradition based on the recognition over a hundred years ago of the importance of sterile technique, including sterile instruments, used by the surgical team. Surgical gloves have an interesting back story, being first requested by the famous Johns Hopkins surgeon William Stewart Halstead for his scrub nurse, Caroline Hampton. He asked the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to produce thin, flexible, rubber gloves to protect her hands chafed by the carbolic acid and mercuric chloride used to disinfect the skin of patients. It turns out his scrub nurse was also his girlfriend, and eventually his wife, so his act was both thoughtful and chivalrous. Halstead’s laconic description regarding the origin of surgical gloves is a famous piece of modern surgical history:<br /><br /> In the winter of 1889 and 1890—I cannot recall the month—the nurse in charge of my operating-room complained that the solutions of mercuric chloride produced a dermatitis of her arms and hands. As she was an unusually efficient woman, I gave the matter my consideration and one day in New York requested the Goodyear Rubber Company to make as an experiment two pair of thin rubber gloves with gauntlets. On trial these proved to be so satisfactory that additional gloves were ordered. In the autumn, on my return to town, an assistant who passed the instruments and threaded the needles was also provided with rubber gloves to wear at the operations. At first the operator wore them only when exploratory incisions into joints were made. After a time the assistants became so accustomed to working in gloves that they also wore them as operators and would remark that they seemed to be less expert with the bare hands than with the gloved hands.<br /><br /> The sterile gloves have a two-way function; they avoid exposing a patient to potentially pathogenic micro-organisms on the surgeon’s or surgical teams’ hands, but gloves also protect the surgical team from infectious agents sometimes harbored within the patients’ blood or body cavities.<br /><br />Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule<br /><br /> The snap of a glove also made me think about Malcom Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule. When Gladwell first proposed this principle, he suggested that 10,000 hours of “deliberate practice” is required to become world-class in any field. After suddenly and unexpectedly having the snap of a glove move from my unconscious to conscious mind, I began thinking about how many hours I had spent in the practice of surgery. First, it is interesting that in all medical specialties we use the term “practice.” Practice implies ongoing training, education, innovation, experimentation, and elucidation of new medical and scientific understanding is required for continuous improvement in the physician’s craft. I began thinking about my own career and decided to make some gross, conservative, but rational estimates. I have been performing surgical procedures for 35 years. I estimate I am engaged in surgical operations on patients about 30 hours a week. I chose 40 weeks a year performing surgical procedures. I know this is an underestimate, but I did it intentionally to count vacation or time spent away at academic meetings or giving lectures at institutions around the world. I multiplied 30 hours a week for 40 weeks a year for 35 years to reckon 42,000 hours spent in the operating room.<br /><br /> That figure far surpasses Gladwell’s proposed 10,000 hours of focused practice to become an expert in a field of endeavor. This 10,000-hour rule has been debunked in several studies recently.  In my opinion, 10,000 hours of practice are not adequate to become a master in the field of surgery. I never believed this number was valid for those of us drawn to a career as surgeons. We all know, whether consciously or subliminally, operations can have unexpected occurrences to derail our plans for a straightforward and successful procedure. New technologies, new equipment, scientific and engineering advances, minimally invasive and robotic platforms, and new combinations of medications and treatments conspire to keep the surgeon learning new material constantly. I know from personal experience if I relax or think I’ve got a specific operation or technique down pat, inevitably it seems some event occurs, including an equipment malfunction, an unusual variation in anatomy, additional tumor nodules or malignant disease extending into adjacent organs not detected on pre-operative imaging studies, or an unanticipated drug reaction. Unpredictable incidents remind me to be constantly vigilant, aware, and humble.<br /><br />Prepared for variations?!<br /><br /> As an example, I have done hundreds of operations for patients with bile duct cancer, also called cholangiocarcinoma or a Klatskin’s tumor, at the base of the liver. This is a challenging and arduous operation, requiring dissection of critical blood vessels and structures, removal of part of the liver, and reconstruction of the bile duct and intestine. I like this operation. Last year I was thrown a hard-breaking curve ball when a patient with complete situs inversus was referred to me after being diagnosed with this cancer. All of his organs are reversed; the liver is on the left side, the spleen on the right, heart on the right…everything is 180 degrees opposite of “normal” anatomy. So, despite performing hundreds of these operations, I proceeded cautiously and mindfully because everything was a mirror image of what I’m accustomed to seeing. I was exhausted at the conclusion of the successful operation. How do you anticipate or practice for that?<br /><br /> Once a pilot has learned to fly a specific plane, he or she becomes expert understanding the cockpit environment. The controls, indicators, and gauges are always in the same place. We don’t have that luxury in our human patients. Variations in anatomy, different pathologic conditions, effects of medications, body size, tissue strength, and concomitant medical conditions combine to make each operation a little different. But like pilots, as surgeons we frequently train in simulated environments to hone our skills and prepare for unexpected situations.<br /><br /> Despite the length of our surgical careers, we go on practicing, learning, and exploring every day. This is a critical core value for surgeons and other physicians. We must be ever watchful for variations or circumstances confounding a well-planned operation. Lately, I made a conscious decision to celebrate the snap of the glove as the moment to focus and prepare to lead the surgical team to manage every operation with expertise, excellence, and calmness. The snap of a glove has moved from my subconscious to conscious mind. I believe we should respect and honor these well-founded surgical traditions, all created to reduce the risk for patients and staff alike. The snap of the glove is now like the home plate umpire shouting, “Play ball!”. The operation begins, and while we have practiced and rehearsed our techniques and maneuvers over thousands of hours, we must be prepared for hits, errors, and great plays. For me, the surgical game begins with the snap of a glove.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />deborabalves/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 21.11.2017.

41	36	2	Crowded Abdominal Cavity	I completed medical school more than 30 years ago. Medical education, like most aspects of life, has changed drastically in the past several decades with the advent of the Internet and electronic education programs and modules. I come from the pre-cellular telephone and personal computer era when dinosaurs like me carried loads of textbooks and sat dutifully through hours of classroom lectures taking copious notes.  Frighteningly, I even recall college chemistry and physics classes where we were required to use a slide rule for mathematical calculations. Oh, the humanity!<br /><br /> At the time I was a medical student, most medical school curricula required you to spend your first two years in lectures and in laboratories learning anatomy, normal body functions, biochemistry, disease pathophysiology, pharmacology, diagnostic studies, and treatment options. All of us were excited and nervous in the summer of our third year because we were beginning our clinical rotations. The third year was comprised of three months of internal medicine, three months of surgery, and two months each of pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry. The fourth year of medical school had few required rotations and provided an opportunity to take electives specific or helpful in whichever career field a student had chosen. I enjoyed all of my third year rotations, despite realizing by fall of my third year that surgery was the career path making the most sense for me.<br /><br /> In the spring of my third year of medical school, I did a four-week rotation on a busy obstetrics service. It was great fun because the obstetrics faculty and residents allowed us to assist during normal deliveries, and then actually allowed students to deliver a few babies. The experience was certain to cause some tachycardia in the medical students, but after delivering the baby, clamping and cutting the umbilical cord, and handing the child to the mother, a sense of great accomplishment was assured.  It was exhilarating and satisfying.  I was glad I had played lots of sports like baseball, basketball, and football growing up; you need a sure set of hands as those new babies are slippery.<br /><br /> Over three decades later, I had not thought about delivering babies or anything to do with obstetrics. I am a surgical oncologist. The malignant or benign tumors I remove are a source of pain, angst, aggravation, and fear for my patients.  After providing care for thousands of patients over the course of my career it is rare to encounter something that startles me. But I can still be surprised and I enjoy a good practical joke, even when played on me.<br /><br />A giant cavernous hemangioma<br /><br /> Several years ago a young woman not yet 30 years old was referred to me with a very large liver tumor. The patient had seen her local physician and reported she felt bloated and unable to eat a normal size meal. The referring physician examined her and was astonished to palpate a large abdominal mass. When I first walked in to the examination room to meet her and her husband, when she stood I wondered if she was pregnant. She had an obviously protuberant belly and I had not yet seen her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.<br /><br /> We spoke for ten or fifteen minutes and then I performed an abdominal examination. With her lying supine on the examination room table, it was possible to palpate a mass originating in her upper abdomen and extending well below her umbilicus. The mass was not tender but was firm. After completing the evaluation, I walked out and loaded the disk with her MRI scans onto my computer workstation. When I opened the abdominal images, I let out a low whistle. Quickly, every physician, resident, nurse, and student in clinic was clustered around the computer screen. A couple of representative images explaining their interest and excitement are seen in the two images below.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> Almost the entire right lobe and the medial segment of the left lobe of her liver was occupied by an enormous tumor. There were areas of necrosis, or dead tissue, and other regions demonstrating recent hemorrhage, or bleeding into this tumor. The characteristics and MRI appearance were all consistent with a benign type of liver tumor called a giant cavernous hemangioma. The term giant was an understatement in this young lady. Hemangiomas are abnormal, but not malignant, spongy collections of blood vessels which can occur in many solid organs in the body. A familiar type of hemangioma is one arising in the skin (which is a large solid organ), known by the common vernacular name as a port wine stain.<br /><br /> This tumor was massive and clearly causing symptoms, so even though benign, I recommended surgical removal. I knew the operation would be a hepatobiliary surgery tour de force because the right and middle hepatic veins were compressed and the tumor abutted and bowed the main, left, and right portal veins.<br /><br />Carefully dissecting through the liver<br /><br /> Liver surgeons use a variety of specialized pieces of equipment to dissect through the liver and expose blood vessels and bile ducts that can be clipped, tied, or stapled to prevent bleeding or bile leakage. I was forced to make a larger abdominal wall incision than usual in this young woman once I recognized it would be necessary simply to remove the impressive tumor. The resident and I were able to mobilize the right side of the liver and take down its attachments to the tissue behind the liver and to the diaphragm. We used a special dissecting instrument with a rapidly vibrating tip to push aside the soft liver tissue while leaving blood vessels and bile ducts intact. The visualized vessels and ducts were then ligated, clipped, or if tiny, cauterized. We slowly and meticulously dissected through the liver and began the tedious process of dissecting the tumor free from the main and left portal veins, hepatic artery branches, and bile duct. We had to maintain normal blood supply to the remaining left liver and intact bile ducts to drain bile from the liver into the intestine. The numerous blood vessel branches running into the tumor were clipped or tied and divided. Once we had preserved the left sided blood vessels and bile ducts, I was able to staple and divide the blood vessels and the bile duct to the tumor-bearing right liver. We continued the careful dissection through the liver until we identified both the middle and right hepatic veins, and again it was possible to staple and divide these vessels. In a moment reminding me of some of the caesarean sections I had witnessed as a medical student, the resident and I gently wrestled the tumor mass out of the abdominal cavity, but, unlike the gentle swaddling of a newborn infant into a warm blanket, we indecorously plopped it into a very large basin we requested just for this purpose.<br /><br /> Returning our attention to the patient and the remaining portion of the left liver, we confirmed there was no bleeding or bile leak from the cut edge of the liver. Our blood loss for the operation was minimal. We checked the blood flow into and out of the liver using color flow ultrasonography. The liver was re-suspended to the diaphragm and the abdominal wall at the falciform ligament with a couple of sutures, and a drain was placed along the liver edge into the large empty space now present in the upper abdomen once occupied by a relatively gargantuan tumor. The patient recovered rapidly and without problems after her operation. She was young and in excellent health so she was walking the day after surgery and quickly developed a ravenous appetite.  Nothing like having a large tumor compressing your stomach and intestine removed to improve your interest in food again. The patient was discharged from the hospital four days after the operation. Her drain tube was removed prior to discharge, and at her first post-operative visit she was recovering well and doing her best to ingest enough protein to permit liver regeneration. She succeeded well, and now has a large hypertrophied left lateral liver occupying her upper abdomen (see the representative image below).<br /><br /><br /><br />Trading tumor for fetus<br /><br /> On final pathology the patient did have a giant cavernous hemangioma, but the pathologist noted a few areas were worrisome for possible deterioration into a sarcoma-like situation. Her pathology slides were sent to multiple institutions and nobody was convinced she had an actual malignant tumor, but enough concern was raised I decided to follow her routinely for a few years to be certain no new tumors developed in the liver or at other sites. I saw her at six-month intervals with repeat MRI scans which confirmed there was no evidence of recurrent tumor. After about three years, I told her I was comfortable seeing her back on an annual basis. We did an annual visit and scans and blood tests were again completely normal. I had a social chat with the patient and her husband and learned she was involved in several new hobbies and activities. We ended the conversation with a pleasant goodbye and made plans for a visit a year later.<br /><br /> Seven months later I received an email from the patient requesting an urgent follow up appointment. Immediately alarmed and worried, I called my clinic staff to contact her for an appointment a few days later.  When she arrived, I entered the examination room and was met by a somber-faced patient and her husband. She looked well but told me she was there to inform me of a new tumor. I asked if she was having symptoms to suggest the tumor had regrown. She solemnly shook her head no. I inquired if she had a disk with MRI scans for me to see. Another shake of the head no, and then she said, “All I have is this.”  She handed me a black and white ultrasound image.<br /><br /> I’ve been a surgical oncologist for a long time, but thankfully my physical and mental facilities have not slowed yet. I studied the image for a few seconds, and by the time I looked up both my patient and her husband were grinning widely, and then openly laughing. She gleefully exclaimed, “I got you, didn’t I?”<br /><br /> Yes, yes you did. The ultrasound image revealed a normal human fetus of fourteen weeks gestation.  I’ve performed thousands of ultrasounds of the liver, pancreas, and other upper abdominal organs or structures, but even though I’m not an obstetrician, I was quickly able to recognize the image of a human fetus.  After the laughter and general hilarity waned and I congratulated them for playing the scene (and me) perfectly, we had an excited discussion about the elation and tribulations of parenthood.  I shared stories from the time when my own children were small. I was thrilled for this young couple and this was not a conversation I had previously experienced in my practice. We agreed we would push the date of her next MRI scan to slightly longer than the originally planned one-year visit to allow her to complete her pregnancy.<br /><br />It’s a boy!<br /><br /> Some time later I noticed the patient’s name on my clinic schedule. I opened her MRI images and saw her enlarged left liver and no evidence of tumor recurrence. The scan also included the pelvic region and I noted a normal, non-pregnant uterus. I knocked once on the door, entered the room, and was immediately introduced to her new son. I have delivered lots of tumors out of patients’ bodies over the course of my career, but this remarkable, alert, healthy delivery brought a smile of pure happiness to my face. Removing malignant tumors from patients is rewarding, challenging, and often provides the best chance for a patient to be cured of this dread disease. I derive great satisfaction from the blessing of helping cancer patients, but holding this infant was a feeling of deep gratification surpassed only by the times years ago when I was embracing my own children.  I hugged my patient and her husband and quickly reported everything was fine with her blood tests and scans. We spent the next twenty minutes watching her newborn son while talking about the fatigue, sleeplessness, and fulfillment associated with an infant. She was tired, but triumphant. As she left, she waved goodbye and stated, “I could have never had him with that huge tumor inside me.”<br /><br /> It certainly would have been crowded in her abdominal cavity with both a giant liver tumor and a full term infant present. I’m glad the removal of the liver tumor went so well and she is fully living and enjoying life. And more importantly, she has now created new life and will experience all of the joy, pleasure, fatigue, frustration, and induction of gray hair associated with this phenomenon.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />tookapic/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 07.02.2018.

42	36	2	Character: Facing An Unresectable Tumor	I slowly opened the door to a patient room on the surgical floor and quietly walked up to my patient’s bedside one day a couple of months ago. It was late afternoon on the day I had operated on this lady. The patient’s husband and sister sat nearby, heads down and silent. They knew what I was going to say.<br /><br /> I asked an inane question, “How are you feeling?” What answer could I expect? I had just performed a surgical procedure leaving a 6 inch midline wound on her abdominal wall. The patient’s eyes fluttered opened, and she whispered, “I am hurting.” Ask an obvious question; get an obvious answer.<br /><br /> I reminded my patient she had a button to push to self-administer a dose of intravenous narcotic using a pain pump. I pushed the button for her, and a low volume beep emitted to confirm a dose was delivered.  She gave an affirmative nod and admitted she had not been pushing the button.  She then asked the question I knew would come, “How did the operation go?” I spent the next 10 minutes describing the surgical findings and the emotionally painful reality her tumor was unresectable.<br /><br />A retroperitoneal tumor <br /><br /> This patient had been referred to me by a medical oncologist who had seen her and told her she had a surgical, not a medical problem.The patient had first presented to her primary care physician approximately a month earlier complaining of weight loss, pain upon eating, and for a week prior to her visit, nausea and vomiting after every meal. The physician examined her and found nothing abnormal, but ordered a CT scan. The CT scan demonstrated a retroperitoneal tumor involving the posterior (backside) of the second portion of her duodenum and the head of the pancreas. There was no evidence of any additional tumors or metastatic spread of disease.<br /><br /> A gastroenterologist performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy including an endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy. The biopsy returned fibrous and spindle cells consistent with a sarcoma. The patient was referred to a medical oncologist, who just as quickly referred her to me.<br /><br /> During her first clinic visit we reviewed her CT images, which were only two weeks old, and it appeared the tumor was resectable with a pancreoticoduodenectomy because the inferior vena cava, portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, and superior mesenteric artery were well clear of the tumor. I explained the operation at length to the patient and her husband. She was having difficulty eating because of pressure of this tumor applied to the first portion of her small intestine, the duodenum, so an operation was scheduled three days later.<br /><br /> Modern imaging studies are remarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), color flow ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography (PET) have markedly improved our ability to stage cancer patients before an operation and to indicate if a tumor is likely to be resectable. However, these technologies are imperfect and don’t always detect the full extent of disease. Cancer can be like an aging baseball pitcher; it may no longer throw a great fastball or sharp curveball, but it can serve up a knuckleball which breaks and moves unpredictably.<br /><br />Unresectable<br /><br /> The chief resident and I opened the patient’s abdominal cavity with a skin incision and then continued down through the layers of the abdominal wall and opened the translucent peritoneum. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, there was no visual evidence of tumor spread, and initial cursory inspection indicated the small and large intestine and stomach appeared normal. Everything changed when I lifted the omentum, the fatty apron of tissue hanging down from the transverse colon over the small intestine, because I found tumor growing directly through the transverse mesocolon and attaching to a loop of small intestine. The tumor was clearly encasing the middle colic artery and vein, the blood supply to the transverse colon. The resident and I mobilized the right colon and the duodenum to get a better look at the retroperitoneal tumor. Fortunately, it was not growing into the inferior vena cava, but as we explored further we recognized the tumor had spread like an advancing wave on the beach to flow around the portal vein and superior mesenteric artery. The latter blood vessel is a crucial artery, supplying all blood flow to the small intestine and over half of the colon. I performed a detailed ultrasound of the pancreas and the liver, finding no additional sites of tumor except for the monster invading key blood vessels.<br /><br /> Recognizing we would not be able to remove this tumor completely, safely, and with negative margins, I performed additional tumor biopsies for advanced genetic and pathology testing. It was clear this patient would need chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy. Knowing radiation treatments would be an important potential option, we placed a series of small metal clips around the tumor, including those regions not seen on the pre-operative imaging studies. We removed the short segment of intestine where the tumor had invaded directly into it, and then anastomosed, or reconnected, the small intestine to itself.  Finally, we brought a limb of jejunum (first part of the small intestine after the duodenum) up to the stomach and opened part of the stomach wall and the jejunum and sewed them together to create a new route for food to exit from the stomach into the intestine.  We had to assure she was able to eat while receiving other treatments.<br /><br /> After the operation was complete, I went out and had a difficult and detailed conversation with the patient’s husband and sister. Thus, they were already apprised of the situation when I walked into her room later the same day.  I took my time explaining the situation to the patient, knowing she was still drowsy from the general anesthetic and from the intravenous narcotic pain medication. I stopped several times and answered questions, or repeated previous statements if she seemed uncertain about what I was saying to her. She eventually voiced full comprehension of her situation and understood potential treatment options in the future.<br /><br />Faith in humanity restored<br /><br /> As I finished, her eyes brimmed with tears. She grasped my left hand with her right, and then shocked me by saying, “I am so sorry you had to tell me that.”<br /><br /> Unbelievable. This lady was demonstrating thoughtfulness, concern, and compassion for me during a moment of extreme duress for her. Despite me just telling her she has a locally advanced, rare, and aggressive cancer. She told me she was worried about me and how delivering this information would ruin my day. I bent down and gave her a gentle hug and thanked her for genuine care and empathy. I confirmed I was disappointed and sad to be delivering bad news, but my job was to provide treatment and assistance to her and her family. I affirmed I would continue to be available at any time to provide support.<br /><br /> I must admit there are days I feel depressed, distressed, and even disheartened about the state of humanity. This is especially true if I make the mistake of watching news programming describing the latest nefarious, dishonest, or unethical exploits of our polarized politicians, government officials, or malicious, hateful people around the globe.  I’m disgusted by the zealots, the haters, the hurters, the self-serving politicians aligned with special interest groups and lobbies, and the indiscriminate cowardly killers of civilians. Thank God for my patients, particularly ones like this lady, who give me hope and remind me there are decent, good, considerate, and non-egocentric individuals still present in the world.<br /><br /> Blessings come from common people and common events. I remember every day I have much to be thankful for.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ordigital/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 04.10.2017.

43	36	2	The Coach: Battling Cancer On The Field	I have played sports throughout my life. Baseball, football, basketball, tennis, soccer, badminton, table tennis, running, cycling and even a short, and impressively painful, stint as a rugby winger. I would much rather play sports than watch sports. My wife may refute the last comment when she finds I’m watching an American, English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, or Italian Serie A soccer match, or when watching my beloved ESPN top 10 plays from the day before. Overall, however, I am more of a participant than a spectator.<br /><br /> Coaches are important individuals in the life of any athlete. Ideally, they should be good role models teaching the fundamentals and advanced skills necessary to be a successful participant in any given sport, while emphasizing sportsmanship, fair play, and maximizing the athlete’s physical and mental preparation. Coaches are larger than life to many young athletes, and often have a profound impact on their charges, sometimes positive and sometimes negative. I vividly remember all of the coaches who I played for throughout my life, and many of them were loud, profane, almost cartoonish caricatures of a guy wearing a whistle around his neck, commanding and wheedling his players to work harder. I say this because I’ve never had the good fortune of playing for a female coach. I am happy and encouraged to see more women coaching from the youth level to college, and in some sports, at the professional level.<br /><br /> Coaches are people who should mentor, teach, encourage, cajole, and inspire the athletes playing for them. I recall fondly several of the coaches I had over the course of my life, and they are people I still admire, respect, and emulate to this day. Conversely, I also remember the negative experiences of those who were verbally abusive or who denigrated, humiliated, or demeaned the efforts of their players. These are individuals I do not respect, but I did learn from the negative examples they represented, and I always strive to demonstrate the polar opposite of their bad behavior.<br /><br />Meet the coach<br /><br /> I have a patient who epitomizes the positive values of a coach. He is colorful, articulate, bombastic, energetic, excitable, enthusiastic, encouraging, and inspirational. He is an assistant football coach and head track and field coach at a moderate-sized high school in a large city in the Southern United States. He always has a twinkle in his eyes and one corner of his mouth tends to turn upward in a sly grin like he knows he’s about to spring a practical joke on you.<br /><br /> I first met the coach more than a decade ago. I’ll provide a spoiler alert by telling you he is still alive as I write this piece. However, it’s been a long, painful, and dramatic journey in his personal battle with cancer requiring multiple surgical procedures, a variety of chemotherapy cocktails, and radiation therapy. I have personally operated on him five times, and he has undergone two additional operations in his home city for acute problems requiring urgent surgery not allowing him to travel to see me. <br /><br /> The first operation I performed on him was a right hemi-colectomy, meaning I removed the right side of his colon (large intestine) and reattached the small intestine to the transverse colon. This operation was for a colon cancer causing pain and bleeding. It was clear at the time of the operation the cancer had spread to lymph nodes near the tumor and all of these nodes were removed as a standard part of the operation. Once the patient recovered from this operation, he received six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. At a clinic visit with me three months into his adjuvant chemotherapy treatments, he matter-of-factly stated in his slow Southern draw, “I hate these poisons, Doc.” <br /><br /> I understand the sentiment. Nobody is excited about the prospect of receiving cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells present in their body. Temporary or permanent side effects from damage or destruction of normal cells is an inevitable consequence of these treatments. Disregarding the side effects, the coach never missed a beat and continued to prowl the sidelines during football season and the infield during track and field season. His wife told me despite the fatigue and the loss of sensation in his hands and feet during chemotherapy, he remained effervescent and positive as he encouraged his students. <br /><br />“You know you’re messing with my football season, right?”<br /><br /> Things were going great for twenty months after he completed chemotherapy. I was seeing him every four months and checking blood tests and CT scans. The twenty-month mark was not a happy visit because his serum tumor marker test, CEA, was elevated and his CT scan showed two liver metastases in the right liver not present on the scan just four months earlier. I walked into the exam room and he immediately knew something was awry. He let out a protracted sigh, glanced at his wife, and said, ”Go ahead, Doc, lay it on me.”<br /><br /> So I did. I laid out the results calmly, answering questions from the coach and his wife during the conversation. I showed him CT images of the two tumors in his liver and we discussed options. The first option I mentioned was surgical removal of the liver tumors, and as soon as I moved to option two discussing additional chemotherapy he waved his hands and proclaimed, “Stop! Stop! Stop! We aren’t talking more chemotherapy here, Doc. Cut those things out of me.” Fair enough. For completeness sake, I managed to sneak in a few comments regarding chemotherapy, but I appreciated he was not interested in hearing it. I knew we could rejoin the dialogue about more chemotherapy later if needed. Instead, we spent twenty minutes discussing the details of a right liver resection, including the downtime while he recovered, and the fatigue he would experience during rapid regeneration of his liver. He mock glared at me and chirped, “You know you’re messing with my football season, right?”<br /><br /> A week later, I performed a routine right hepatectomy on the coach. The operation went flawlessly. He was up speed walking in the halls the next day, and by day four demanded to be released from the hospital. He was eating a normal diet (normal for the coach since I caught him with a contraband double cheeseburger and French fries sneaked in by his wife) so I had no reason to keep him in the hospital. I saw him in the office two days later. He was healing well and he planned to return home the same day. I admonished him to take it easy for a few weeks and allow himself time to heal.  He shot me a look I interpreted as, “Sure Doc, whatever you say,” and headed out for his drive home.  My suspicions about his compliance with physician’s instructions was confirmed the following week when his wife sent me an email including several pictures of the coach prowling the sideline during the Saturday night football game a few days after I had seen him in the office.<br /><br /> Well then, so much for doctor’s orders.<br /><br />Two new tumors<br /><br /> Despite himself, the coach recovered uneventfully and did well for another year. As the next football season approached, I saw him in clinic for a scheduled visit. To my considerable disappointment, I was forced to walk in and inform him and his wife he had two new tumors in the enlarged (hypertrophied) left lobe of his liver. I have never witnessed a more pure expression of exasperation on another humans face. He kept quickly turning his face from me to his wife and back again until he finally exclaimed, “Well, what are you going to do about it?”<br /><br /> Before I could answer his question he held up his hand like a traffic cop telling an automobile driver to stop and stated emphatically, “Skip the chemotherapy talk, can you take them out?” The two tumors were near the lower edge of the left lobe of the liver, so I responded in the affirmative. It was possible to remove these two tumors with wedge resections.  His response was immediate, “All I need to hear. Let’s do this thing.”<br /><br /> So we did. The next week I performed an operation made slightly more difficult by dense adhesions, or intra-abdominal scar tissue, of his left liver to the abdominal wall and diaphragm, but I successfully removed the two small tumors. An intraoperative ultrasound examination of the liver failed to show any additional tumors. Per his usual post-operative routine, he was up doing laps the night of surgery and was out of the hospital three days after the procedure. I mentioned a few days later at our first post-operative visit he should refrain from full-time coaching duties and, expectedly, he rolled his eyes and stated, “Yeah, right.” I had to try.<br /><br />Starting chemotherapy<br /><br /> Another football season was completed and when I saw him in the winter before track season started, his CT scan revealed a new liver tumor, and also a single right lower lung nodule. This was a relatively rapid recurrence of his malignant disease, so I forced him to sit through a discussion of options, including chemotherapy. To both the coach’s and my surprise, his wife spoke up and remarked calmly, “You know, you really should consider some chemotherapy. This stuff just keeps coming back.”  The look of extreme exasperation returned, but fortunately, this time was directed at his wife. A remarkable staccato conversation took place going something like this (I am paraphrasing because I was laughing too hard to remember it word for word).<br /><br />           “Woman, are you trying to poison me?” <br /><br />The wife, “No, but you are being a stubborn mule!” <br /><br />The coach, “You know I have no time for this chemotherapy crap and feeling down! If I’m a mule, I’ll be doing some kicking!” <br /><br />The wife, “Don’t lay any of your whining on me man. Man up and take it!  And if there’s any kicking, somebody may lose some balls!” (Figuratively or literally? This was not specified).<br /><br />The coach (looking at me), “Doc, are you hearing this? Did you put her up to this?”<br /><br /> I managed to regain my composure and a modicum of professional demeanor, and informed the patient I had not previously conversed or conspired with his wife against him. The surgical fellow and medical student who accompanied me into the patient’s exam room stood by with stunned expressions on their faces. They weren’t sure what to make of this couple or my interaction with them. They did not know them as I did. This couple had been married for over 30 years and had a wonderful bond and harmony. Despite the bad news I had delivered, both the patient and his wife were hopeful. We had a calm and rational discussion of options and the patient agreed to see his medical oncologist at home and initiate systemic chemotherapy.<br /><br /> I called the medical oncologist and explained the situation and we agreed the patient was in excellent shape, active, and would be a candidate for second line chemotherapy used to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The patient initiated treatment the next week. He returned in three months and the liver tumor and lung tumor were both smaller by approximately one third. <br /><br />Fourth round of surgery<br /><br /> When I walked into the room to discuss the findings with him, for the first time in our relationship he looked haggard and beaten down. He shook his head from side to side and told me, “Doc, this stuff is wearing me out.” I get it. His mood brightened when I told him the tumors were smaller and no new tumors had appeared. As usual with this patient, before I could finish discussing all the results, he started asking when I was going to schedule an operation. He had already undergone three cancer operations and I knew he had significant adhesions in his abdominal cavity from previous surgery. Nonetheless, he had two tumors in locations where surgical resection was feasible. I let him recover from the effects of chemotherapy for another month and then performed a somewhat unusual operation. I made an incision at the site of the scar under the ribs on his abdomen, and after entering the peritoneal cavity I began to dissect through the heavy scar tissue.  After about an hour of work his liver was completely exposed. I performed a standard intraoperative liver ultrasound and confirmed I could detect only a solitary tumor at the top of the left lobe. Once again, it was possible to perform a wedge resection to remove this tumor and take only a small amount of normal liver. Then I did something unusual. I had discussed this with my thoracic surgical oncology associates before the operation, and they agreed, while unorthodox, opening the right side of his diaphragm and removing the small tumor at the surface of the right lower lobe of the lung would spare him a chest incision.  Opening the muscle of the right diaphragm readily exposed the lung tumor, which was removed without difficulty. We left a temporary chest tube in to make sure there was no air leak from the lung and to drain any fluid accumulating in the right chest cavity. <br /><br /> The patient was a little slower to recover after this fourth round of surgery. The chemotherapy had weakened him yet he was walking as usual on day one, but at a slow and measured pace.  Nonetheless, he was out of the hospital four days after the operation. At his first clinic visit, I felt compelled to discuss completing another three months of chemotherapy, knowing he would have no interest in complying with the suggestion. The mere mention of chemotherapy earned me a third look of exasperation from the patient, and plenty of eye rolling from his wife who said, “Good luck convincing him to do that.”<br /><br /> So we returned to a follow up routine. Six months later I received a call from a surgeon in his home city who informed me the patient had come in to the hospital with a complete small bowel obstruction. The patient had a fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and an elevated serum white blood cell count, so the surgeon appropriately took him to the operating room and found a short segment of small bowel was twisted, cutting off its blood supply. The surgeon removed this section of nonviable small intestine and anastomosed, or reconnected, the two ends of small bowel. <br /><br />Surgical removal of para-aortic lymph nodes<br /><br /> Fortunately, we had a period of over two years before lurking cancer cells reappeared in lymph nodes along his aorta. I found out about this during a follow up visit when the patient mentioned his medical oncologist had noted his serum CEA level was elevated and had obtained a PET scan. This scan showed three lymph nodes near his aorta were highly active, suggesting they contained malignant cells.  The medical oncologist then treated this area with a combination of low dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In checking the CT scan we obtained, I could see one enlarged lymph node. It was not clear if this still harbored cancer cells because his CEA blood test was normal, so we opted to watch. A few months later his medical oncologist called me and asked if I would consider removing the one lymph node because it was still active on a repeat PET scan and had increased in size. Surgical removal of para-aortic lymph nodes for colorectal cancer is an unusual approach, but this man had already survived many years with stage IV disease, and the solitary lymph node was the only evident site of active cancer. The patient and his wife returned and we discussed a surgical approach. In his usual glib and cavalier style, he instructed me to proceed at flank speed.<br /><br /> A couple of weeks later I performed an operation that was as difficult as I anticipated because of dense scar tissue throughout the belly cavity. Once I moved all of the small intestine out of the way, it was possible to palpate the abnormal lymph node easily. I removed the enlarged, cancer-bearing lymph node and several lymph nodes in the area. It turned out to be a good decision because one of the lymph nodes adjacent to the obviously abnormal lymph node bore a microscopic nest of viable cancer cells. This operation took almost four hours to complete because of the extensive adhesions. As a result, for the first time the coach was in the hospital for a full week recovering from the slow return of normal contractions and activity of his bowel. <br /><br /> I didn’t even bother discussing chemotherapy with the patient during his hospitalization knowing his opposition. His medical oncologist adopted the same approach. The coach and I agreed to a follow up visit three months after his latest operation. <br /><br />Surprise field trip to the cancer center<br /><br /> Two months after his operation, I received an unexpected call from the coach. He called my secretary who paged me and asked me to call my patient, “urgently.”  Anxiously, I called his cell phone fearing I was going to hear his cancer had recurred yet again. When he answered, he said brightly, “Hey Doc! What are you doing and where are you?” This may seem to be a peculiar personal question, but not from this patient. I explained I was just completing inpatient rounds and he said, “Well come on down to the lobby, I want you to meet some people.”  Stammering, I asked dumbly if he was in the building, and he laughed and said, “Duh!” Asking a stupid question, I deserved a “Duh” as a result.<br /><br /> I took the elevator down to the lobby where my grinning patient was surrounded by a flock of about two-dozen high school students. He explained he was teaching a health class at his high school and wanted to impress upon his students the importance of cancer prevention and proper screening for early detection. He decided to load them onto a school bus and take a road trip to a cancer center. No forewarning for me or anybody else, just a spontaneous “Let’s get it done” approach by the coach. He asked if I could spend a few minutes talking to his students. I winked at him and replied, “I can do better than that.” <br /><br /> I spent the next two hours escorting the coach and his students to various areas of the hospital and asking surprised colleagues to explain briefly a bit about what they did in the care and diagnosis of cancer patients. We visited my laboratory and my colleagues showed them some of the interesting research tools we use to study malignant disease. As I escorted the coach and his gaggle of students to the lobby he turned to me beaming and gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The students began laughing and informed me he had a habit of doing that at the school, too. <br /><br />Cancer: A long, tough game<br /><br /> The surgical adventures of the coach were not finished. A little over a year after the surprise high school student visit, he had a new liver tumor appear on CT scan located deep in the remaining lobe of his liver. This time I knew I couldn’t remove it and leave him with a volume of liver adequate to survive. However, radiofrequency ablation to destroy the tumor with heat was feasible. The tumor was near a large blood vessel, the left hepatic vein, draining blood out of the remaining left liver. It was also close enough to the diaphragm my radiology colleagues and I felt it would not be safe to place the needle through the skin using ultrasound or CT guidance. So a surgical approach was indicated. I performed this operation, and after a grueling two hours of dissecting his liver millimeter by millimeter free from scar tissue I was able to locate the two centimeter diameter liver tumor with ultrasonography. I treated it with a radiofrequency needle, destroying it completely. <br /><br /> Four months after this fifth cancer operation, the same surgeon in the patient’s home town called to inform me he had once again performed a long and difficult operation for a bowel obstruction on the coach. Surgical procedures do not come without immediate, acute, or long-term risks. This time the surgeon did not remove any small intestine; the obstruction was caused by a hair pin kink in the bowel where it was stuck to the retroperitoneum.<br /><br /> Cancer is an unpredictable opponent. The coach has been treated with most of the types of therapy we use to manage cancer in our patients. He has never regained normal sensation in his hands or feet as a result of toxicity from some of his chemotherapy treatments. Despite the pain of recovering from numerous operations, the side effects of chemotherapy, and the chronic diarrhea and discomfort he developed after radiation therapy, the coach is cheerful and still leads his teams on the field. His wife has told me in sidebar conversations he is beloved by the students, teachers, and administrators at his school. He is a constant source of inspiration and positive energy. When I saw the coach a few months ago for a routine follow up visit, I was pleased to inform him no evidence of cancer was found based on his imaging studies or blood tests. He nodded, and in a moment of reflection calmly stated, “You know, Doc, this cancer thing has been a long, tough game. The outcome is still uncertain. But one thing is clear. Nobody can say you and I didn’t play our hearts out. We left it all on the field.”<br /><br /> I don’t recall ever hearing a more eloquent or meaningful statement. The coach is a testament to indefatigable human spirit, optimism, hope, and grit. He is a shining example of all a coach, and a great human being, should be.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Pexels/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 12.09.2017.

44	36	2	Cancer Care In The Future	Multidisciplinary team management of many types of cancer has led to significant improvements in median and overall survival. Unfortunately, there are still other cancers which we have impacted little.  In patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular cancer, we have been able to improve median survival only by a matter of a few months, and at a cost of toxicity associated with the treatments.  From the point of view of a surgical oncologist, I believe there will be rapid advances over the next several decades.<br /><br />Robotic Surgery<br /><br /> There is already one surgery robot system on the market and another will soon be available. The advances in robotics and imaging have allowed for improved 3-dimensional spacial recognition of anatomy, and the range of movement of instruments will continue to improve.  Real-time haptic feedback may soon become possible with enhanced neural network systems.  It is already possible to perform some operations with greater facility, such as very low sphincter-sparing operations for rectal adenocarcinoma in patients who previously would have required a permanent colostomy.  As surgeons’ ability and experience with new robotic equipment becomes greater, the number and types of operation performed will increase and patient recovery time, length of hospital stay, and return to full functional status will improve.  Competition should (and needs to) drive down the exorbitant cost of current equipment.<br /><br />More Cost Effective Screening<br /><br /> The mapping of the human genome was a phenomenal project and achievement. However, we still do not understand the function of all of the genes identified or the complex interactions with other molecules in the nucleus.  We also forget that cancer is a perfect experiment in evolutionary biology.  Once cancer has developed, we begin treatments with cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, targeted agents, immunotherapies, and ionizing radiation.  Many of the treatments are themselves mutagenic, and place selection pressure on cells with beneficial mutations allowing them to evade response or repair damage caused by the treatment, survive, multiply, and metastasize.  In some patients who are seeming success stories, new cancers develop years or decades later, induced by our therapies to treat their initial cancer.  Currently, we place far too little emphasis on screening and prevention of cancer.  Hopefully, in the not too distant future, screening of patients with simple, readily available, and inexpensive blood tests looking at circulating cells and free DNA may allow us to recognize patients at high risk to develop certain malignancies, or to detect cancer at far earlier stages when surgical and other therapies have a higher probability of success.<br /><br />Changing the Mindset<br /><br /> A diagnosis of cancer incites fear and uncertainty in patients and their family members. Many feel they are receiving a certain death sentence.  While we have improved the probability of long-term success with some cancers, there are others where we have simply shifted the survival curve to produce a few more months of survival before the patient succumbs.  We need to adopt strategies that allow us to contain and control malignant disease without necessarily eradicating it.  If a tumor or tumors are in a dormant or senescent state and not causing symptoms or problems, minimally toxic treatments stopping tumor growth and progression allowing the patient to live a normal and productive life would be a success.  Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes are never “cured” of their diabetes, but with proper medical management their disease can be controlled and they can survive and function without any of the negative consequences and sequelae of the disease.  If we can understand genetic signaling and aberrations sufficiently, perhaps we can control cancer for long periods while maintaining a high quality of life for our patients.<br /><br />Taking on Tough Political Issues<br /><br /> I am often asked by patients if I believe there will ever be a “cure” for cancer. I invariably reply it is unlikely if we continue to engage in activities and behaviors which increase the likelihood of developing cancer.  Cigarette smoking, smokeless tobacco use, excess alcohol or food intake, lack of exercise, and pollution of the environment around us produce carcinogens or conditions increasing the risk of cancer development.  Unless we find the courage and strength to limit access or ban substances that are known carcinogens, like cigarettes, and begin as thoughtful citizens of the planet behaving in a more responsible fashion to eliminate air, ground, and water pollution, we will not make a significant impact on the incidence of cancer.  We must also be willing to develop greater and more far reaching population education programs about things as simple as proper ultraviolet light protection during sun exposure, and to recognize tanning beds or excessive, unprotected natural sunlight exposure increases the risk of a particularly difficult and vicious malignancy, melanoma.  Whether we like to admit it or not, humans respond to societal pressures and images displayed or touted by media, marketing firms, or so-called beauty and glamor outlets that may actually be harmful to the health of the populace.  People do and should have a free will, but they should also be given understandable, honest, and rational information on the potential consequences of their choices.  There should also be a higher level of personal accountability and responsibility for negative outcomes based on an individual’s choices.<br /><br />Global Cancer Care<br /><br /> It is estimated that between half and two thirds of the world’s population, particularly in poor or developing countries, have limited or no access to cancer prevention, screening, or care. The improved outcomes we report in medical and surgical journals from advanced countries assume the treatment can be paid for and access is available to all.  Nothing is further from the truth.  Meaningful efforts to rein in the rampant increases in cancer drug costs, reduce the prohibitively long and expensive process to develop and approve a novel treatment, and to provide training and education for practitioners in developing countries must be made.  The disparities even within the United States are great, and it is well known and documented that disadvantage populations are often diagnosed with later stage disease, and generally have reduced chances of long-term success with the treatments available.  We must become inclusive, not exclusive, in our worldview and through outreach and development programs begin to build infrastructure and access to affordable care worldwide.<br /><br />Thinking Outside the Box<br /><br /> Personalized or individualized patient cancer care is a popular buzz phrase these days. In reality, we currently have very few drugs or targeted agents to act upon the numerous genetic or epigenetic abnormalities present in the average cancer.  To search for drugs to new targets or abnormal pathways, we must create a system where there is rapid assessment, cost effectiveness, and streamlined regulatory approval for patients with lethal diseases.  Personalized cancer treatment is not affordable without major changes in policy and practice.  We should recognize malignant tumors have interesting physicochemical and electrical properties different from the normal tissues from which they arise.  Therapy with electromagnetic fields specifically tailored to a given patient’s tumor properties can enhance tumor blood flow and improve delivery of drugs or agents while reducing toxicity and side effects.  Developing approaches that do not produce acute and long-term side effects or an increased risk to develop second malignancies must be a priority.<br /><br /> Science and technology information is being produced at an incomprehensible rate. We need help from specialized colleagues with big data management and recognition of trends and developments which can be quickly disseminated throughout the medical community, and to appropriate patient populations.  All of these measures require commitment and dedication to changing the way we think, reversing priorities based far too much on profitability of treatments rather than availability and affordability of treatment, and we cannot ignore the importance of programs to improve cancer prevention, screening, and early diagnosis.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Foto-Rabe/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 15.08.2017.

45	36	2	That Thing Was Growing Inside Me? (Part 3)	Slightly more than a decade ago, I received a phone call from a panicked primary care physician from a small town in West Texas. The physician rapidly and breathlessly explained a patient came into his office two days before stating he was unable to eat, his waist size had increased from 34 to a 52 inches in only a few months, and the perfunctory CT scan revealed a mass extending all the way from the liver down into the pelvis. <br /><br />An abdomen about to burst<br /><br /> I immediately accepted the patient and told the physician to send him to my office the next day.  This 50 something year old gentleman, who had been previously completely healthy and an active, hard working farmer, was clearly miserable. His abdomen was distended to the point of looking like it was going to burst. The abdominal skin was taut and shiny, and he was breathing over 30 times a minute because he was unable to take a deep breath from the increased pressure upward on his diaphragm and lungs. The muscles of his arms, legs, and face were wasted. He had a typical appearance of cachexia; severe malnutrition with his pleading eyes protruding from sunken sockets.<br /><br /> After speaking with this gentlemen and his family and completing a physical examination, I reviewed the CT images obtained in West Texas. I realized his massive tumor was originating from the edge of the right lower liver, extending down into his pelvis and compressing the stomach, all of the small and large intestine, and even causing compression of the bladder and ureters, the small tubular structures draining urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Despite the relatively immense size of this tumor, it was clear it arose from the lower edge of the liver and was not near any of the major blood vessels flowing into the liver or draining blood out of the liver.<br />  <br /><br /><br /><br />                       Image of a giant peritoneal sarcoma compressing the intestines.<br /><br />  <br /><br />“Bye bye, tumor!”<br /><br /> I scheduled this man for an operation only two days later because of his debilitating symptoms.  I started the operation with a right subcostal incision, a cut in the skin under the ribs on the right side. A quick assessment confirmed the tumor was arising from a small portion of the liver lateral to the gallbladder. Intraoperative ultrasound confirmed there were no major blood vessels involved by the tumor. It was possible to remove a small section of the liver from which the tumor arose, less than 10% of the total liver volume, and then detach the tumor from other abdominal organs. The tumor was so large I had to extend the incision simply to remove it from the abdominal cavity. To my surprise, the tumor had very few attachments to other organs or structures, and once its origin in the liver was divided, I was able to gently deliver the mass out of the peritoneal cavity and clamp and divide the few remaining blood vessels supplying the tumor.<br /><br />“Holy shit, what is that thing?”<br /><br /> This tumor was so large and somewhat gelatinous I was concerned I would drop it or rupture it.  We did not have a basin or container large enough to transport the tumor from the operating room to the pathology suite. Therefore, the circulating nurse brought a wheeled cart into the operating room usually used to transport sterile instruments and supplies from the surgical core area to the operating room. We wrapped the tumor in sterile towels and I pushed it over to the pathology suite. The wide-eyed expressions from the experienced senior pathologist and the surgical pathology staff were hilarious. The pathologist took one glance as I uncovered the tumor and exclaimed, “Holy shit, what is that thing?” Why does everyone keep calling these giant tumors “things”?<br /><br /> I showed the pathologist the origin of the tumor from the edge of the liver and returned to the operating room. The intestine and other structures, which had looked compacted, blue, and pathetic, were already pink and contracting wildly. It reminded me of times when I found myself in a large, relatively immobile crowd of people, and the wonderful feeling of relief once I broke free from the crowd and could move unencumbered. We had plenty of room to spare closing his abdominal wall muscles and the skin.<br /><br /> This gentleman was one of the happiest people I’ve ever seen on the morning of his first post-operative day, despite a long bilateral subcostal incision. He was already wolfing down breakfast of eggs, pancakes, and sausage he had gone to the cafeteria to purchase. We had not yet written an order allowing him to drink even liquids. Absence of a formal medical order permitting him to drink broth and juice or enjoy jell-o in any color he ordered was not going to stop him; he had room for his stomach to distend and his bowel to work and he was not going to wait around for us. He explained he was making up for lost time and was going to eat whatever he wanted. Fortunately, he suffered no ill effects from his rapid self-progression to a regular diet. He was discharged from the hospital four days after the operation. When I saw him back for his first post-operative visit five days later, we discussed the rare hepatic angiosarcoma I had removed. I informed this man and his family I had delivered a 45 cm greatest diameter tumor, almost 18 inches in size. The final weight of the cancer emanating from his liver was 6.5 kilograms, or slightly greater than 14 pounds. The pathologist admitted the total tumor weight was probably greater because when he cut into it a large amount of fluid and old blood drained from the tumor. I estimate after lifting it from the patient’s abdominal cavity to the back table in the operating room it seemed like at least 20 pounds to me.<br /><br />Sarcomas: Numerous operations, recurrent tumors<br /><br /> Sarcomas are unusual and uncommon cancers with a propensity to recur locally or metastasize to the liver and lungs. Individuals who are experts in sarcoma surgery will say sarcoma patients can train new surgeons for many years because of the numerous operations they may require for multiple recurrences. In general, chemotherapy is not particularly effective for types of sarcoma other than GISTs. This gentleman did well for almost four years before he developed recurrent tumors in his peritoneal cavity. I operated and removed these intra-abdominal tumors, and he did well for another two years before he developed a few lung metastases. These pulmonary tumors were removed during two operations over the next year; but the patient ultimately succumbed to multiple new tumors growing in his lungs. Near the end of his life, he declined chemotherapy treatments when he learned the low probability of success in shrinking the tumors and the profoundly toxic side effects. He did achieve over six years of what he proclaimed, “A really great life.” He was upbeat, energetic, ate normally, ran his farm, loved to tell jokes, and travelled extensively with his wife and family. He told me the experience with cancer taught him to enjoy every day he was granted. After the initial huge tumor was removed, he was quickly able to eat and exercise and return to his normal appearance and level of activity.<br /><br />When our senses don’t sense it<br /><br /> Biology is remarkable. The complexity of the human body is difficult to comprehend. There is much we still do not know or fully understand. The development of cancer is an equally complicated process with a mind-boggling interplay of genetics, epigenetics, biochemistry, immunology, and dynamic interactions with the host. The occasional patient we see with massive tumors represents an eye-opening experience for all involved; it is difficult to believe how large a tumor can grow to be in some locations in a human body before causing symptoms leading to detection.<br /><br /> When the inevitable question is asked by patients and family members after I remove a very large tumor, the answer is, “Yes, incredibly enough, that ‘thing’ was really growing inside you.”<br /><br /> And as amazing and wonderful as our primary senses are, I cannot explain why a tumor can grow to a massive size before we sense something is awry.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Keep reading: <br /> That Thing Was Growing Inside Me (Part 1)That Thing Was Growing Inside Me (Part 2)<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Archangel12/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 13.06.2017.

46	36	2	That Thing Was Growing Inside Me? (Part 2)	The liver includes the gallbladder and bile ducts. Occasionally, patients are diagnosed with a massive tumor at some site in their body. Sarcomas arising in the retro-peritoneum, the area behind the gut where the kidneys, aorta, vena cava, and some significant muscles and nerves reside can be larger than a basketball. Patients and family members are astonished a tumor can grow to a relatively huge size before being detected after causing mild discomfort or other subtle symptoms.<br /><br />Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of 20 cm in diameter<br /><br /> A few weeks ago, a new patient came to my office with a giant tumor. She is a patient in her early 70’s who has been healthy and active. She takes a single medication for her mild hypertension, which controls and normalizes her blood pressure. She and her several daughters noticed she was becoming less active and more easily fatigued over the past four or five months. Blood tests obtained during a visit to her family physician one month ago revealed a red blood cell count only about half of normal; she was severely anemic. The patient noted she was not eating well and her abdomen felt “swollen”, so the physician referred her to a gastroenterologist for endoscopy and ordered a CT scan.  The CT scan was obtained before the endoscopy, and a very large tumor of the upper abdomen, greater than 20 cm in diameter, was readily evident. The gastroenterologist performed a colonoscopy, which showed no abnormalities or sources of bleeding, while an upper endoscopy revealed a small area of ulceration along the final third of the stomach. Biopsies were obtained of this area, which ultimately demonstrated a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The patient was then referred to me.<br /><br /> This soft spoken, delightful lady and her daughters agreed to allow several medical students and residents examine and palpate her abdomen. When she lay supine on the examining room table, it appeared she had an approximately full term pregnancy with a mass palpable from the tip of her sternum extending well below the umbilicus (belly button). <br /><br /> The residents, medical students, and I reviewed her CT images. In addition to the large mass arising from the greater curvature of her stomach, there were two 4 cm metastases in her left liver and one similar size lesion in the right liver. GIST frequently metastasizes to the liver. These tumors can be treated with a medication called imatinib, a drug targeted to a specific genetic gain-of-function mutation in a tyrosine kinase receptor called c-KIT. This patient had already been started on oral imatinib, but she was extremely symptomatic with poor appetite, early satiety, and was requiring weekly blood transfusions for persistent bleeding from the ulcerated stomach tumor. I had a long discussion with the patient and her daughters, and after answering all questions and discussing alternatives, they agreed to an operation early the next week to remove the malignant stomach tumor and treat the three large liver metastases.<br /><br />Removal of the giant tumor<br /><br /> A few days before the operation we transfused the patient with two units of packed red blood cells because her hemoglobin level, which should be 12-15 gm/dL, was only 6.5 gm/dL the day I saw her in clinic. We started the operation with an incision from the tip of her sternum, called the xiphoid, to her belly button. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the soccer-ball size mass protruded from the incision. As expected from the endoscopy and CT findings, despite the large size of the tumor, it arose from a short segment along the lower aspect of the stomach. Working with a chief resident, we dissected this sizable tumor free from the surrounding structures adherent to it, including the pancreas, duodenum, and the transverse colon. Once the tumor was dissected free from all of these structures, it was a simple matter of firing a gastrointestinal stapling device twice along the greater curvature of her stomach assuring we were clear of the malignant tumor. The tumor and a small volume of her stomach was removed entirely.<br /><br />  <br /><br /><br /><br />                      Removed gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of 23 cm in diameter.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Earlier in my career, if I wanted a picture of a tumor or a photograph during an operation, I had to arrange for a certified medical photographer to join us in the operating room. One of the joys and advantages (or disadvantages) of modern technology is all surgeons are now their own photographer using their cellular telephones. Patients, including this lady and her daughters, often ask me to take a picture to show them the offending malignancy. I wanted to take the large stomach tumor over to pathology myself, so I removed my surgical gown and gloves and took a couple of quick cell phone photos of the tumor with a sterile measuring tape placed below it to provide a size reference. I never place any patient names or numbers in these photos, and I always delete the images from my phone after sharing them with the patient and their families. Patient privacy and confidentiality must be conserved and respected!<br /><br /> I carried the bucket containing the gastric GIST over to pathology, and our pathologist confirmed the resection margins were tumor-free. I scrubbed my hands again and re-gowned and gloved. We removed the left liver containing the two large tumors. Intraoperative liver ultrasound revealed about a dozen small tumors (3-4 mm) scattered throughout liver. This was not an unexpected finding with a GIST, and I knew treatment with imatinib could successfully control these small tumors for many years.  The larger tumor in the right lobe was deep in the liver, but was easily destroyed completely using ultrasound-guided microwave ablation. At the conclusion of the operation, it was easy to sew close the abdominal wall muscles because there was no longer a large tumor protruding and pressing outward.<br /><br />“Do you have pictures of Mom’s cancer?”  <br /><br /> I walked out to speak with the patient’s daughters and described the findings and results of the operation. I reported their mother was stable and did very well throughout the operation. She required no blood transfusions and was resting comfortably in the recovery room. The eldest daughter finally asked the question I expected, “Do you have pictures of Mom’s cancer?” <br /><br /> I hesitated briefly as a few of the daughters squirmed or grimaced, and then responded, “In fact, I have some on my phone. Be careful what you wish for; are you sure you want to see this?”<br /><br /> After quickly exchanging glances among themselves, all agreed they wanted to see photos revealing the appearance of the large tumor corresponding to the CT images I had shown them in the office. I opened the photos on my phone and was met with common exclamations of disbelief and incredulity. The usual questions ensued, “Oh my God, how can some thing like that grow in our mother?”<br /><br /> “How could she be walking around with that thing in her?”<br /><br /> “You said that thing is 23 cm in diameter. What is a centimeter? How many inches is that?  How on earth can something that big not just kill you outright?”<br /><br /> All good questions ladies. I converted centimeters into inches for them, but still sensing some uncertainty, I finished the conversion for them by saying, “Surgeons like to compare the size of tumors to common objects like food. Your mother had the equivalent of a large canteloupe melon in her belly.”<br /><br /> The whole family was stunned. As more family members arrived, each wanted to see the pictures of the incomprehensibly large GIST. Low whistles, exclamations of amazement, or grunts of distress and disgust emitted from each individual who saw the images.<br /><br />Happy ending<br /><br /> Happily, this delightful lady recovered from her operation quickly and uneventfully. On the evening of surgery she grasped my hand, and eyes brimming with tears, thanked me for removing the large mass. She stated unequivocally she felt better than she had in months, and the sensations of heaviness, pressure, and discomfort had vanished. She had minimal pain from her abdominal incision and was discharged from the hospital four days after the procedure. When I saw the patient and several of her daughters back in the office for her first post-operative visit, they asked for more details about the tumor. I reported, like a pediatrician would do with a newborn baby, the pathologist had weighed her tumor. It came in at a whopping 2.3 kilograms, or just over 5 pounds! Despite the presence of stage IV disease with several remaining small liver metastases, this patient in all probability will live many more years thanks to the availability of the targeted drug imatinib. The patient now has a slightly concave rather than a very protuberant abdomen, and she is able to eat full-sized meals and enjoy her children and grandchildren.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Keep reading:<br /><br />That Thing Was Growing Inside Me?

47	37	2	What All Parents Should Know About IVs	By Heather Michon |<br /><br /><br /><br /> Caitlin King only got to hold her newborn twin girls for a few precious moments before they were whisked off to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). That’s where their journey began. Born at 32 weeks and six days, Abbie May and Gardner Grace weighed just four pounds each.<br /><br /> Caitlin describes the NICU as a whirlwind, filled with fragile little babies attended by a team of nurses. “[They were] the most amazing people I’ve ever experienced,” says Caitlin. “The NICU nurses were everything to us.”<br /><br /> She was awakened in the middle of the night by the news that the medical team was having a hard time finding good veins on the girls’ limbs. The nurse requested permission to insert intravenous (IV) lines into their bellybuttons.<br /><br /> The umbilical vein remains viable for about a week after birth and it is sometimes used to take blood samples. Umbilical vein catheterization (UVC) is recommended when good peripheral veins can’t be found, but it does carry risks. Some of the complications include a potential for infection, bleeding from the umbilical vein, and embolism.<br /><br /> Caitlin gave her consent, but was concerned for her daughters. “After the nurse left, I just lost it. I started crying and it just sounded so scary,” she admits.<br /><br /> The umbilical line worked for Gardner Grace, but not for twin sister Abbie May. Staff finally inserted the catheter into a vein in Abbie May’s scalp.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Scalp vein catheterization is even less common than a UVC and most consider it a last resort. In some ways, it’s an excellent location: there are several veins in a newborn’s skull that are easy to visualize and because a baby tends not to move their head the way they move their limbs, the catheter is less likely to be dislodged. Statistically, it seems to carry no greater risk than a line in the arm or the leg. However, it’s avoided when possible because it’s more upsetting for parents, especially since it often requires the area to be shaved and can leave a scar.<br /><br /><br />  Caitlin had previously worked on a project with a medical research company, giving her some familiarity with IVs.  “Every NICU nurse we had, I told them ‘I don’t know anything about medical stuff except IV infiltration. So you have to make sure that my kids’ IVs don’t infiltrate,’” she laughs.<br /><br />  One day, she looked at Abbie May’s scalp and thought the area around the catheter looked puffy–one of the primary signs of infiltration. She called the nurse over to check it, and the nurse agreed that she was also concerned when she looked at it. Examination showed the catheter had infiltrated and was leaking fluid into the surrounding tissue. It was quickly removed. After 15 days in the NICU, the newborns were discharged from the hospital and finally got to go home.<br /><br /><br /><br />  While Caitlin believes the nurse probably would have discovered the infiltration herself, she’s glad she was able to have an active role in her newborns’ care.<br /><br />  “I was pretty proud that I knew there was something wrong and was able to point out to the nurse that it didn’t look right.”<br /><br />  In a situation where she felt powerless, this was something she had done that helped her babies.<br /><br />  It was a boost of confidence in a stressful time. “If, as a parent, I can be aware and say ‘look, I think something’s wrong here,’ and bring attention to something a doctor or nurse may be missing–because they’re human and sometimes we miss things–then I’ll do it.”<br /><br /><br /><br />  Now the mom of two healthy, active three-year-olds, Caitlin hopes other parents take from her experience the importance of educating themselves when it comes to kids and IVs. “There’s no awareness about IVs, it’s not talked about, and yet it happens every day,” she says. “As a parent, feeling helpless is one of the worst feelings in the world. If there’s something you can do when it comes to knowing what to look for, do it.”<br /><br />  Do you have an IV story to share?

48	37	2	IV Complications: What Can Go Wrong?	https://www.myiv.com/iv-complications/<br /><br /> By: Ryan MacArthur <br /><br />Full story:<br /><br /> The use of intravenous (IV) therapy is more common than ever. While it’s an extremely valuable tool for healthcare professionals, patients and providers must know and understand the risks associated with IV therapy.<br /><br /> Infiltrations<br /><br /> The delivery of fluid and/or medication outside the vein and into the surrounding soft tissue. An infiltration can occur for a number of reasons, such as leakage from the insertion site or catheter dislodgement. Patients will see swelling of the soft tissue surrounding the IV, and the skin will feel cool, firm, and pale. Small amounts of IV fluid aren’t typically life-threatening but some medications, even in small doses, can be very toxic to the surrounding soft tissue.<br /><br /> Extravasations<br /><br /> The infiltration of a blistering agent (also known as a vesicant) into the surrounding IV site as the result of leakage from a vein. Vesicants can cause tissue destruction and result in pain at the IV site and along the vein. Because chemotherapy medications are highly toxic, extravasation is especially dangerous.<br /><br /> Hematoma<br /><br /> The leakage of blood from the vein into the surrounding soft tissue. This can occur when an IV angiocatheter goes through more than one wall of a vein or if pressure is not applied to the IV site when the catheter is removed.<br /><br /> Phlebitis and Thrombophlebitis<br /><br /> Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein, while thrombophlebitis refers to inflammation associated with a blood clot within the vascular system. Both are more common on the backside of the hand than on the upper part of the elbow and may occur in hospitalized patients where an IV has been in place for several days.<br /><br /> Air Embolism<br /><br /> A result of a large volume of air entering the patient’s vein via the IV. When an air bubble enters a vein or artery, it can cause life-threatening blockages. In order to prevent air bubbles from forming, clinicians will keep the IV bag from moving and ensure it is it remains hanging vertically.<br /><br /><br />  References:<br /><br />   Everything you need to know about air bubbles in your patient’s IV line https://thenursepath.blog/2016/12/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-air-bubbles-in-your-patients-iv-line/<br /><br />   Know the Difference Between Infiltration vs. Extravasation https://www.rn.com/nursing-news/know-the-difference-infiltration-vs-extravasation/<br /><br />   Air Embolism http://www.healthline.com/health/air-embolism#overview1<br /><br />   Medical Emergencies and Complications http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/aegd/mod01_mec_ivcomp.html<br /><br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 16.01.2018.

49	38	2	Why physicians need side gigs	At first, it may seem strange that “physician” and “side gig” are even used in the same sentence. As someone who talks about physician burnout and as the founder of the Physician Side Gigs Facebook group, I’ve been asked many times how adding yet another thing to the physician’s plate could possibly be a good idea.<br /><br /> And yet, I’m a strong believer that physicians should have additional revenue streams and pursue other interests. Why?<br /><br />The monetary benefits<br /><br />1. The obvious one: extra money.  This one speaks for itself.<br /><br />2. Tax benefits.  Since most physicians are W-2 employees, they don’t get a lot of the tax benefits that small businesses or 1099 workers receive.  Side gigs allow access to additional retirement plans and tax deductions.<br /><br />3. Establishing passive revenue streams.  I’m always surprised by how little we as physicians think about passive revenue streams.  We’re groomed to work 60+ hour work weeks, but our training doesn’t include lessons on how to make the most of our incomes once we finally start making a higher salary.  It’s a skillset that many don’t have time to develop, but even simple investments or partnerships can create significant side income streams, some of which require minimal work once set up.  It’s my hope that the Facebook group and this site will help connect people with these opportunities.<br /><br />The non-monetary benefits<br /><br /> For me, my writing and speaking have never been about the money.  Sure, the monetary benefits are wonderful, but more so than that, I love the benefits that have come along with pursuing my other passions.  These include:<br /><br />1. Creating job flexibility and financial security.  Having the ability to generate money outside of your day job gives you more flexibility to seek job options that are in line with the life you are trying to create.  When I talk to physicians about burnout, there’s often a feeling that people are stuck – worried about paying off student debt, unable to find part-time options, etc.  Having an additional income stream (or many) takes off some of the pressure to stay in a situation that may not be ideal.  It may helps to protect you financially in the event that you can’t practice clinical medicine anymore or have an unexpected break in employment.<br /><br />2. Expanding my network of physicians.  I’ve met so many interesting people through these pursuits.  Whether they are other like-minded physicians pursuing side ventures or physicians that have reached out to me because they’ve seen something I’ve written or saw me speak, I’ve made lots of new friends and connections.  This has incredible value – I’ve been able to help people on both ends of the job search, had interactions that have helped me in my own personal and professional life, and have found exciting opportunities that I never would have otherwise had access to.  I’m a strong believer that the more people you know, the more effective you can be in all of your pursuits and the more opportunities arise.<br /><br />3. Having something in my life that is my own — done on my terms.  With all the demands that come along with clinical medicine as well as those that come with parenting, I was really craving something that was uniquely me.  I’ve always enjoyed networking, mentoring, writing, and of course, talking.  While jobs and children come with relatively stringent deadlines, hours, and expectations, I can pursue my side gigs during pockets of free time, and can ramp up or down my pursuits depending on how busy things are in the rest of my life.<br /><br />4. Having an outlet to process my life in a fulfilling way.  Because of the nature of my side gig (writing and speaking about life in medicine), I’ve actually found it really helpful personally to talk about the aspects of medicine that aren’t conventionally discussed amongst physicians.  It’s also been wonderful to have these conversations with people who are facing the same challenges with work-life balance, the changing healthcare landscape, and other issues related to life in medicine.  I love being able to use my voice in the field to help others find happiness in medicine or to bring publicity to issues that I’d like to see generate more discussion.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />ajotasan/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 13.02.2018.

50	38	2	5 things physicians can do to protect themselves	As physicians, we’re groomed to take care of patients. During training, we don’t talk about compensation, work-life balance, or the business of medicine. In many ways, it’s actually frowned upon to do so, and our hierarchical systems discourage open conversation on these subjects. We also very rarely say ‘no’ during the course of our training, and this tendency stays with us for the remainder of our careers.<br /><br /> Ultimately, these things hurt us. Physician burnout is multifactorial, and so much of its rise can be attributed to institutional and administrative factors and the changing healthcare landscape. We can’t predict the future, but there are certain steps that we can take to protect ourselves:<br /><br />1. Don’t be afraid to ask uncomfortable questions. Yes, patient care always comes first, and I certainly don’t advocate a ‘me first’ mentality in the job interview process. However, although being a physician is a calling, it is also a job, and money and lifestyle do matter, not only for your own job satisfaction, but for that of your family.<br /><br /> If there are things that are matter to you, such as how many weeks of vacation the partners get, how often you get to eat lunch, or how often you get called in on call, ask these questions. Hopefully, groups are upfront with you with answers, because it’s also in their best interest to recruit someone who will be happy within the framework of their group. If there are certain topics they are avoiding talking about, keep your antenna up and dig deeper.<br /><br />2. Negotiate. Newsflash: groups expect you to negotiate, and almost always have some wiggle room built into their initial offer. I don’t care how competitive the job market is, if it’s academic or private, or how lucky you feel that they are even talking to you. As long as you do so tactfully, nobody is going to deny you a job for negotiating.<br /><br /> This applies to salary, benefits, days off, protected academic time, restrictive covenants, malpractice tails, you name it. The worst they can say is no. If they’ve made you an offer, they’ve already made a decision that they like you, and you should feel comfortable asking. Before you do so, do your research and try and find out what others in the group have been able to negotiate. That will give you more power at the bargaining table, as well as alert you to things that you may have thought were nonnegotiable. Once you’ve agreed to something, you’ll have a hard time dropping it later, so have the conversations before you sign on the dotted line.<br /><br />3. Network. The more people you know, the more you’ll hear through the grapevine. Although job boards and MGMA numbers are out there, the best jobs are often the ones that aren’t advertised, and survey numbers don’t do a great job of breaking down salaries by what job requirements are. Posting a job on a board or through a recruiter typically costs money, and groups are understandably more comfortable getting somebody who is a known entity.<br /><br /> Finding a job through a contact gives added security on both sides. Even after you’ve taken a job, it’s a great idea to keep up with your connections. It will allow you to keep a pulse on the rest of the market, hear about what steps groups are taking, and what solutions they’ve come up with to problems you may be having.<br /><br />4. Have a lawyer experienced in physician contracts review your contract. It’s amazing how many people do not have their contracts reviewed since they trust the people offering them the job. Many of those people regret it later. These lawyers have seen the problems caused by exclusions/inclusions in people’s contracts and will alert you to any red flags. Don’t fall under the, ‘well, this is the standard contract’ trap – group contracts are obviously set up to protect the employer and you should do the same for yourself.<br /><br />5. Know your deal breakers and don’t be afraid to say “no” or ask for additional compensation. This is the one I want to emphasize the most. Before and after contract negotiations, it is always in your employers best interest to get the most out of you, both financially and in workload. I think about it like this: when you call someone to your house for some work you need to be done, they aren’t shy about billing by the hour or even just to provide a quote. A lawyer isn’t timid about charging an hourly rate just to take a phone call.<br /><br /> Why don’t physicians value their time more? We’ve put in a ton of time in training, and yet so much of what we do is uncompensated. Yes, there are things we do out of personal interest, such as teach residents or sit on professional committees, but there are typically a lot of responsibilities added to our plate that weren’t part of our original contract agreements. I’m not saying to say no to them all – but if there’s something that you know will make you unhappy or be a huge time sink, don’t take it on. At the very least, don’t take it on without asking what you get in return.<br /><br /> If you flip the situation around and you were asking for more from your employer, I’m fairly certain there would be pushback on that end. If there is something that will actively make you unhappy on a regular basis, such as increasing the number of patients you have to see in a day or having to supervise a midlevel provider without any additional compensation, be willing to walk away from an existing job or wait for a better job in the job search.<br /><br /> Of course, it’s important to keep in mind that you’ll ideally be working with your employer/colleagues for a long time, and this is not a confrontation. Good working relationships require some give and take, and there are some battles that are not worth fighting. But please, put some thought into figuring out which ones are, and in those cases, don’t be afraid to do it. Believe in your value and your skillset. If you don’t ask, you can be sure that you won’t get it.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />ArtCoreStudios/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 07.11.2017.

51	38	2	Physician Burnout: The Radiology Report	COMPARISON: Innumerable articles on the topic and experiences of professional and personal contacts.<br /><br /> FINDINGS: The number of articles about physician burnout have increased significantly over the past few years, along with routine vocalization of said feelings. As with most terms with inherent sex appeal, the term “burnout” may overdramaticize and somewhat belittle the underlying sentiment.<br /><br /> Multiple different physicians are identified, each with unique circumstances, including varying depths of physician debt, practice and compensation structures, demographics, personal lives, subspecialties, and reasons for going into medicine. Many express discontent with recent trends in medicine, whether it be related to declining compensation and/or increasing workload, litigative aspects of medicine, work-life balance, or patient perceptions of physicians.<br /><br /> Despite this, the vast majority of physicians still love and believe in what they do. There is not yet frank collapse or obstruction of the medical system; however, there are moderate degenerative changes which warrant consideration of both local and systemic etiologies. These are all within normal limits of most professional careers, but borderline increased because of unique aspects of the necessity of services provided, humanistic nature of the profession, and length of training required.<br /><br /> IMPRESSION: Overall increase in use of the term physician burnout and in sentiment of discontent, which are nonspecific and mean different things to each physician. Clinical correlation* for root causes should be performed on an individual basis, and appropriate individual and systemic actions should be taken to ameliorate the situation. Close follow-up is indicated. Otherwise, the eventual downfall of the medical profession as we know it is not excluded.<br /><br /> * The use of vague terminology and recommendations for clinical correlation and appropriate action are used facetiously and should not be taken as endorsement or condoning the gratuitous use of such phrases in a clinical radiology report.<br /><br /> (Because sometimes my brain processes information in the form of a radiology report.)<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />445693/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

52	38	2	Don’t Assume That You Know What A Doctor Looks Like	As a South Asian, I have to say I’ve never been told I don’t look like a doctor on a racial basis. If anything, because of the number of South Asians in medicine in real life and in media, TV shows, and movies, people actually assume I’m in medicine … or an IT field.<br /><br /> However, I have had many people assume I’m a nurse (I’m female), ask how old I am and where I trained before letting me do a procedure (a question rarely asked to my older white male colleagues), and state their surprise that I don’t have an accent (presumably because many of the South Asian physicians they’ve seen are immigrants, and I’m part of the first generation of American born South Asian physicians).<br /><br /> So, what exactly does a doctor look like in America today? Let’s review some facts from a 2014 survey of physicians with an active license to practice medicine in the United States, conducted by the Federation of State Medical Boards, and a 2010 AAMC database:<br /><br />  66 percent of actively practicing physicians are males, and 32 percent are female (2 percent declined to answer).<br /><br />  Approximately 20 percent of actively practicing physicians are less than 40 years old, and approximately 11 percent are above 70 years old. The rest are somewhere in between.<br /><br />  75 percent of actively practicing physicians graduated medical school in the United States or Canada. In order, the five countries where most of our international medical school graduates come from are India, the Caribbean, the Philippines, Pakistan, and Mexico.<br /><br />  In 2008, 75 percent of U.S. physicians were white, 12.8 percent of physicians were Asian, 6.3 percent of physicians were black/African American, 5.5 percent were Hispanic/Latino, and 0.5 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native. Statistics on medical school demographics show that these numbers are actively changing, with the number of minority students on the rise.<br /><br /> Obviously, the diversity doesn’t stop there. Much like the demographics of the rest of our country, our physicians were raised in different socioeconomic backgrounds, practice different religions, have varying politics, live in both rural and urban settings, have different hobbies, and live different lifestyles. A New York Times Article cites that physicians are about 50/50 Democrats/Republicans overall.    From greatest to least, an article from the Journal of General Internal Medicine from 2005 states physician religious preferences to be Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Atheist/Agnostic, Hindu, Muslim, Orthodox, Mormon, Buddhist, and other.  From looking at my own physician colleagues, interests vary from surfboarding to baking.<br /><br /> My point is this: Don’t assume you know what a doctor looks like, especially in the outside world sans white coats and scrubs. In this situation, I’m not sure how you could reliably pick us out of a crowd without speaking to us. We are much more diverse in our appearances and personal lives than you may think. Just know that when it comes to matters related to patient care, we do have one thing in common – we have the patient’s best interest in mind, and we are trained to handle emergency medical situations. Please don’t turn down our help because we don’t look “doctor” enough to you.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Pexels/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

53	38	2	Why Are Female Physicians Scared To Be Women?	My question is this: Why haven’t these systems really evolved with them? It’s now been 167 years since Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to graduate with a medical degree in the United States. Nowadays, just shy of 50 percent of medical students are women. Yet we still struggle with issues like maternity leave, pumping at work, asking for days off when the kids are sick, and career advancement; only 15 percent of academic department chairs are women and only 22 percent of tenured professors are women.<br /><br /> Trust me, I take a lot of pride in what I do, and find it incredibly fulfilling. I feel really fortunate to have a job that I love and a wonderful patient base, and to have had great colleagues and mentors. I think we (female physicians) all do, or we wouldn’t put ourselves through things like taking call when 39.5 weeks pregnant or voluntarily staying late for an emergency add-on, even if it means missing our child’s first soccer game. Or pumping in the MRSA-ridden hospital bathrooms because we’re afraid to ask for our — ahem, legally mandatory — nursing rooms. So gross.<br /><br /> Somehow, though, in doing these things, we’ve set up a system where a male attending who rearranges his schedule to make his child’s school play is praised, while the pregnant female physician stresses about asking to come in an hour late so they can go to their OB appointment.<br /><br /> There are obviously lots of issues at play here, but at the heart of it, I think we as females have been too scared to assert ourselves as women because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1. We believe that we have to behave like a male to succeed. We’re not all built the same way, and have different strengths.  Are the male physicians trying to do everything we — on average — do better? (Studies have shown that we are more likely to follow evidence-based guidelines, score higher on care and quality, and tend to show more empathy and are perceived as better listeners.) Just as we use our other personal strengths to succeed, we should use those unique to our gender — like our ability to multitask.  While I know plenty of amazing male physicians, what percentage of them are performing as complex of a balancing act at home as the average female doc?<br /><br />2. We fear that any complaining will be perceived as laziness or being difficult. Somehow we think that a male physician can complain about anything and everything, and it’s even humorous and results in change, but we think that if we do it, it’ll be used against us and be the subject of conversation once we leave the team room.  Throw in the fact that by nature, we like to please people, and we’re a lot less likely to point out unfair treatment and push for that salary bump or new title.<br /><br />3. We think working part time or asking for altered schedules will make people think we don’t take our jobs seriously, and will contribute to our lack of professional success. These things can actually provide us with the energy we need to care for our patients and juggle all the multitasking more efficiently. Not to mention that happier physicians get better patient satisfaction scores, and physician retention/professional outcomes are far better when a female is given opportunities for a flexible or reduced work schedule.<br /><br />4. We feel like talking about things like pumping or our kids will either gross our male colleagues out or make them think medicine isn’t our first priority. But we bite our tongues when they tell their inappropriate stories all the time (yes, you all know what you’ve been forced to listen to). This is the reason med student and resident forums are littered with worried posts about how to deal with pumping during lengthy board exams. It’s 2016: This shouldn’t be the source of more stress than the exam itself.<br /><br />5. We seethe silently when patients and other hospital staff (including other physicians) don’t realize that we are physicians, but are afraid we’ll sound stuck up or catty if we address it. When was the last time you were referred to as a nurse or a social worker (and the male medical student with you was assumed to be the doctor)? I respect the professions I’ve been mistaken for; that’s not the issue. However, I do find the underlying sentiment behind assuming only males can be doctors to be indicative of a more serious problem, and we as females need to find (tactful) ways to reply.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, there is some truth in the consequences of doing these things. But there are enough of us to change that. Let’s not apologize for ourselves all the time, or be afraid to ask for what we need to make our lives work. This is not a call to arms or an attack on male physicians; they have their own attributes that make them invaluable to the system. Rather, it’s a plea for female physicians to recognize that we are smart, dedicated, and caring, and we also have a lot to contribute to our patients and our employers as women.<br /><br /> A change in culture requires women physicians to acknowledge that we are different from men and have different priorities — and to assert that these qualities contribute to the medical system instead of detract from them.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />daily sunny/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

54	38	2	Why You Should Care About Medical Student Debt	Many recent articles make the case for why becoming a physician is not actually a sound financial plan, highlighting decreases in physician salaries, the opportunity cost of the years in training, and the income ceiling relative to those in prominent other professional positions. Despite this, a reliable six-figure salary is not one to scoff at, and the public is hardly going to crusade against reimbursement cuts for physicians or rally for better physician pay the way that they (rightfully) do for teacher pay.<br /><br /> But there is a bigger reason why society should be concerned about the cost of a medical education. There are long-term consequences to a system where the average amount of debt for a graduating medical student is over $150,000. This number will almost inevitably rise, with medical school tuition steadily rising at approximately 3-4% a year for both private and public institutions. These numbers do not take into account the additional debt accrued by many during years of residency and fellowship, where an average salary of $55,300 (Medscape debt and salary report, 2014) may not adequately support the families of those training in large metropolitan areas.<br /><br /> What does this mean for our system?<br /><br /> 1. Potentially, fewer physicians in the system. The numbers have yet to support this argument, with medical school applications actually at all-time highs. However, particularly as physician salaries decline and the voicing of physician discontent/burnout rises, undertaking a large debt may be harder for aspiring physicians to swallow.<br /><br /> 2. Less diversity of the physicians who are in the system. More than half of U.S. medical students come from families in the top quintile for family income. This is a complex statistic reflecting far more than an ability to afford the education, but concerning in that students of lower socioeconomic status will have even more barriers to entry of qualified applicants into the field.<br /><br /> 3. A shift of physicians away from primary care positions towards specialized fields, which reimburse better, and can help physicians pay their loans back faster. In an era where policy is promoting primary care, and there is already a shortage of primary care providers, the dangers of this are obvious.<br /><br /> 4. A change in physician culture. Traditionally, people have entered medicine to make a difference in the lives of patients, and have seen the profession as a calling. As financial pressures increase, the need for physicians to consider the financial implications of their practice patterns and populations could lead to a further lack of access to care by underserved patient populations. The doctor-patient relationship will also suffer, as the need to generate a profit increases.<br /><br /> 5. Fewer physician scientists. The advancement of medicine as a field relies on the progress of science, which needs the perspective of physicians to guide research into clinically relevant directions. Much of this research arises from academic medical centers, where physicians, on the whole, make significantly less than their counterparts in private practice. Before making the argument that MD/PhD physicians are actually subsidized and don’t pay for medical school out of pocket, realize that only a minority of physicians who practice academic medicine and are on the clinical staff at academic medical centers are MD/PhDs Given the pay differential, as debt becomes more burdensome, physicians may be less inclined to take academic positions.<br /><br /> These are all reasons why the public should be concerned about medical student debt. It’s not about the physicians as individuals, but about the field we are striving to protect and further develop.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Zak Greant/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

55	38	2	10 Truths Of Physician Parents	2. You can’t go to any of your children’s activities or events without getting curb-sided, usually about somebody’s rash or poop. If you’re not a pediatrician, you will fumble through most of these questions, unless it happens to be your lucky day and the question is actually related to your subspecialty.<br /><br /> 3. You book family vacations based on when there’s CME offerings in your destination of choice. Interesting how your children believe that everyone has been to Disney or Atlantis, since they’ve been there five times already.<br /><br /> 4. Your child will often be the first kid dropped off at school or the last kid picked up from school — or both. The daycare teachers will drop not-so-subtle hints alluding to this (so they can go home earlier). Hey, when you signed up for before/after school care, you thought you were supposed to use it. Every. Single. Second.<br /><br /> 5. You will likely be told that you taught your child something age-inappropriate at some point. In second grade, I was assigned a show and tell on MIs since my dad was a cardiologist. When I started with, “I’m going to talk about myocardial infarctions,” the teacher interrupted to say I was supposed to talk about heart attacks. I replied, “Oh, that’s the lay people term.” My dad was called in for a parent-teacher conference a few days later.<br /><br /> 6. You adamantly try to prevent childhood obesity by providing your kids with well-balanced, healthy meals. Meanwhile you subsist on granola bars, coffee, and random snacks from the hospital nursing stations and PACU. Just one of many examples of medical hypocrisy your child will point out as they get older.<br /><br /> 7. Your children say no a little too quickly/emphatically when asked the question, “Do you want to be a doctor too?” You just hope it isn’t in front of your chairman. Shocking how the pager going off in the middle of the Super Bowl or always being late for dinner hasn’t attracted them to the field. Honestly, a part of you is relieved.<br /><br /> 8. Your children will be prohibited from doing normal things just because you happen to have seen an unfortunate case. I’m a radiologist, and my husband is a plastic surgeon. Things our kids can’t do: Jump on a trampoline, put their hands on the escalator rails at the mall, pet an unknown dog … the list goes on.<br /><br /> 9. You stock Dermabond in your house like it’s going out of style. If you’ve used it enough, one day you’ll walk into a room and see your older child putting Elmer’s glue onto the younger sibling’s cut.<br /><br /> 10. You have no concept of the fact that the above things are not normal.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Pexels/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

56	38	2	8 Tips From My Non-Medicine Friends That Make Me A Happier Doctor	1. Don’t take yourself so seriously. It’s true that at work we often deal with life or death situations. But that doesn’t need to translate into everything that we do.  Both at work or at home, it helps to be able to laugh at yourself. In fact, one of the best ways to create a connection with your patients and your colleagues is by showing your human side. Your resume and the certificates on your wall speak for themselves.<br /><br /><br /> 2. Admit what you don’t know. You lose a lot more credibility by making things up or fumbling through an explanation than just saying you’re not sure and that you’ll find out. Many patients are double checking what you say on the Internet before they’ve even left the office building. After years of exam after exam, we start to believe we have to know everything, forgetting that every profession has experts in particular areas of their field. Patients are okay with this.<br /><br /><br /> 3. Take a sick day if you’re really not feeling well. Believe it or not, our patients don’t want to get the latest daycare bug we’ve contracted it from our toddlers. Additionally, coming to see us requires time and money on their end – they don’t want us when we’re not at our best. You don’t want your contractor coming out to fix something at your house and doing 50 percent of the job and charging you full price. If somebody really can’t reschedule, see if one of your partners can fit them in.<br /><br /><br /> 4. More often than not, things can wait. In a world where “STAT” seems to be thrown around whether warranted or not, it’s easy to overemphasize the urgency in what you want done. Yes, the type A in all of us wants results as quickly as possible. But the stress involved in making sure that things happen at that speed is often not worth it. The next time you’re pushing hard for something to happen immediately, pause and consider whether it really needs to happen that second. If not, save the energy for when it actually does.<br /><br /><br /> 5. Self-care really is important. My non-medical friends are quick to point out when I don’t practice what I preach, and this comes up most often in relation to how I take care of myself. Ever notice how all of your friends who aren’t in medicine eat better than you, exercise more than you, and are usually less stressed out than you (even if they have more to be stressed out about)?<br /><br /><br /> 6. Sometimes, mediocrity is OK. What do you call the person who graduates last in your medical school class? None of my friends routinely ask their doctors where they went to medical school, how many publications they have, or what they hope to accomplish in five years. There are times where life is just about survival. Yes, try and do your best, but also cut yourself some slack.<br /><br /><br /> 7. Not everyone gets personal satisfaction out of their job. For many people, a job is just a job. While I know many physicians that don’t love their jobs for various reasons, I know very few that don’t get personal satisfaction from what they do. We are actually really lucky to have found something that we’re passionate about that provides this. It may not stop us from groaning when the pager goes off in the middle of the night, but that’s another story.<br /><br /><br /> 8. When you’re done with your education, enjoy your life. If you don’t want to work 80 hours a week, don’t. If you want to pursue another passion, you can. If you want more flexibility, ask for it. Yes, during training medicine can be all encompassing and the path is pretty outlined. But after you’re done, you have choices. Make the ones that make you happy.<br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Kenny Louie/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 08.11.2016.

58	40	2	What All Parents Should Know About IVs	By Heather Michon |<br /><br /><br /><br /> Caitlin King only got to hold her newborn twin girls for a few precious moments before they were whisked off to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). That’s where their journey began. Born at 32 weeks and six days, Abbie May and Gardner Grace weighed just four pounds each.<br /><br /> Caitlin describes the NICU as a whirlwind, filled with fragile little babies attended by a team of nurses. “[They were] the most amazing people I’ve ever experienced,” says Caitlin. “The NICU nurses were everything to us.”<br /><br /> She was awakened in the middle of the night by the news that the medical team was having a hard time finding good veins on the girls’ limbs. The nurse requested permission to insert intravenous (IV) lines into their bellybuttons.<br /><br /> The umbilical vein remains viable for about a week after birth and it is sometimes used to take blood samples. Umbilical vein catheterization (UVC) is recommended when good peripheral veins can’t be found, but it does carry risks. Some of the complications include a potential for infection, bleeding from the umbilical vein, and embolism.<br /><br /> Caitlin gave her consent, but was concerned for her daughters. “After the nurse left, I just lost it. I started crying and it just sounded so scary,” she admits.<br /><br /> The umbilical line worked for Gardner Grace, but not for twin sister Abbie May. Staff finally inserted the catheter into a vein in Abbie May’s scalp.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Scalp vein catheterization is even less common than a UVC and most consider it a last resort. In some ways, it’s an excellent location: there are several veins in a newborn’s skull that are easy to visualize and because a baby tends not to move their head the way they move their limbs, the catheter is less likely to be dislodged. Statistically, it seems to carry no greater risk than a line in the arm or the leg. However, it’s avoided when possible because it’s more upsetting for parents, especially since it often requires the area to be shaved and can leave a scar.<br /><br /><br />  Caitlin had previously worked on a project with a medical research company, giving her some familiarity with IVs.  “Every NICU nurse we had, I told them ‘I don’t know anything about medical stuff except IV infiltration. So you have to make sure that my kids’ IVs don’t infiltrate,’” she laughs.<br /><br />  One day, she looked at Abbie May’s scalp and thought the area around the catheter looked puffy–one of the primary signs of infiltration. She called the nurse over to check it, and the nurse agreed that she was also concerned when she looked at it. Examination showed the catheter had infiltrated and was leaking fluid into the surrounding tissue. It was quickly removed. After 15 days in the NICU, the newborns were discharged from the hospital and finally got to go home.<br /><br /><br /><br />  While Caitlin believes the nurse probably would have discovered the infiltration herself, she’s glad she was able to have an active role in her newborns’ care.<br /><br />  “I was pretty proud that I knew there was something wrong and was able to point out to the nurse that it didn’t look right.”<br /><br />  In a situation where she felt powerless, this was something she had done that helped her babies.<br /><br />  It was a boost of confidence in a stressful time. “If, as a parent, I can be aware and say ‘look, I think something’s wrong here,’ and bring attention to something a doctor or nurse may be missing–because they’re human and sometimes we miss things–then I’ll do it.”<br /><br /><br /><br />  Now the mom of two healthy, active three-year-olds, Caitlin hopes other parents take from her experience the importance of educating themselves when it comes to kids and IVs. “There’s no awareness about IVs, it’s not talked about, and yet it happens every day,” she says. “As a parent, feeling helpless is one of the worst feelings in the world. If there’s something you can do when it comes to knowing what to look for, do it.”<br /><br />  Do you have an IV story to share? Tell us about it here.<br /><br /><br />  <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Photo courtesy of Caitlin King <br />Article last time updated on 08.02.2018.	Jasmine Williams	2018-02-08 00:00:00	85	m2m
59	40	2	IV Complications: What Can Go Wrong?	https://www.myiv.com/iv-complications/<br /><br /> By: Ryan MacArthur <br /><br />Full story:<br /><br /> The use of intravenous (IV) therapy is more common than ever. While it’s an extremely valuable tool for healthcare professionals, patients and providers must know and understand the risks associated with IV therapy.<br /><br /> Infiltrations<br /><br /> The delivery of fluid and/or medication outside the vein and into the surrounding soft tissue. An infiltration can occur for a number of reasons, such as leakage from the insertion site or catheter dislodgement. Patients will see swelling of the soft tissue surrounding the IV, and the skin will feel cool, firm, and pale. Small amounts of IV fluid aren’t typically life-threatening but some medications, even in small doses, can be very toxic to the surrounding soft tissue.<br /><br /> Extravasations<br /><br /> The infiltration of a blistering agent (also known as a vesicant) into the surrounding IV site as the result of leakage from a vein. Vesicants can cause tissue destruction and result in pain at the IV site and along the vein. Because chemotherapy medications are highly toxic, extravasation is especially dangerous.<br /><br /> Hematoma<br /><br /> The leakage of blood from the vein into the surrounding soft tissue. This can occur when an IV angiocatheter goes through more than one wall of a vein or if pressure is not applied to the IV site when the catheter is removed.<br /><br /> Phlebitis and Thrombophlebitis<br /><br /> Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein, while thrombophlebitis refers to inflammation associated with a blood clot within the vascular system. Both are more common on the backside of the hand than on the upper part of the elbow and may occur in hospitalized patients where an IV has been in place for several days.<br /><br /> Air Embolism<br /><br /> A result of a large volume of air entering the patient’s vein via the IV. When an air bubble enters a vein or artery, it can cause life-threatening blockages. In order to prevent air bubbles from forming, clinicians will keep the IV bag from moving and ensure it is it remains hanging vertically.<br /><br /><br />  References:<br /><br />   Everything you need to know about air bubbles in your patient’s IV line https://thenursepath.blog/2016/12/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-air-bubbles-in-your-patients-iv-line/<br /><br />   Know the Difference Between Infiltration vs. Extravasation https://www.rn.com/nursing-news/know-the-difference-infiltration-vs-extravasation/<br /><br />   Air Embolism http://www.healthline.com/health/air-embolism#overview1<br /><br />   Medical Emergencies and Complications http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/aegd/mod01_mec_ivcomp.html<br /><br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 16.01.2018.

60	41	2	Being superhuman in the most human circumstance	However, at a moment’s notice, a patient’s course can become critical, and our training comes into play as we try to save our patients’ lives.<br /><br /> Most of the time, this happens with patients that we are worried about coming into the day, those who have had a tenuous hospital course and who are being watched closely by many health care professionals. Sometimes, however, it can happen with a patient that seemed to be doing well up to that point, who had stable vital signs, stable labs, and no significant change in their physical exam. Once things become critical, the code bells go off, and numerous health care professionals rush into the room. Doctors, nurses, physician assistants and nurse practitioners run into the room with emergency equipment and medications reserved for life-threatening events. Medications are infused, chest compressions are performed, and external shocks are being delivered to the heart in the hope of saving a patient’s life that is on the brink of being lost. For a moment, our insecurities are put to the side, and we believe in ourselves and our abilities that much more as we hope to rescue a patient on the brink of death. At times, we are successful, and we breathe a sigh of relief, but other times, all of our efforts are futile no matter how hard we try, and the patient that we worked hard to save passes away in front of our eyes.<br /><br /> As the time of death is pronounced, families are notified, coroners are called, and the equipment and medications are moved away. We all stand there in shock, exhausted and saddened by the course of events. We huddle together and debrief about what led to the patient’s death and ask what could have been done differently. Understandably, some people are shaken up and trying to process everything. What is weird, however, is that it is still the middle of the day; there are still patients to take care of, and as hard as it is to believe, we are expected to put aside in our minds what we just went through and continue to care for others as if we had not gone through that experience.<br /><br /> When I think about these particular experiences and discussions I have had with other health care professionals over the years, it strikes me that in many other professions, there would not be an expectation to continue on with daily affairs immediately after the experience of a loss of a loved one. A break is usually recommended given the gravity of that loss. However, for us, we are still expected to keep going through the day, trying to manage our emotions as we see other patients. It is as if we are called to be superhuman in the most human of experiences, encountering the human experience at its deepest, rawest and most vivid form as we endeavor to save the life of a critically ill patient. It is an interesting situation because we are still human at the end of the day, full of emotions that are trying to rise to the surface as we are involved in these critical situations. Given the busyness of the work day, recuperation is short-lived in the moment, and we continue on with our day.<br /><br /> Over time, as we continue to encounter these events through our careers, the importance of self-care becomes much more paramount. Through conversations with friends and family members who are inside and outside of medicine, through time away from the hospital, and through other extracurricular activities, we find time to recuperate. Our mental, physical, emotional and spiritual well-being comes to the forefront in those moments, and we are reminded of our humanity. We realize that even though we may feel superhuman in those critical moments, there is still a human being underneath that still needs that crucial rest.<br /><br /> Perhaps it is the unique form of our training that allows us to deal with these intense situations at a moment’s notice, and over many years of training and practice, we find mechanisms to help us to persevere even after going through a deeply human experience. At the end of the day, however, our well-being is still important. We must take care of ourselves before we can take care of others, and when we inevitably have to go through a raw experience where the saving of a life is paramount, be it as a doctor, nurse, physician assistant or nurse practitioner, we can draw on our strength as a team and be superhuman together from an emotional standpoint, in the most human of circumstances.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />StockSnap/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 23.01.2018.

61	41	2	A letter from a grateful physician to his patients	For many of you, it is a world where you are made the most vulnerable, and where your potential recovery is based on what a person that you may not know chooses to do. I understand how disorienting and powerless that this may make you feel, which is all the more reason why I carry deep gratitude in my heart for the times that you allowed me to come into your world during my training to become a physician.<br /><br /> When I started out on this journey, the most stressful thing to me was considering that I would start to interact with patients as part of their care. I felt like I was trespassing onto the sacred ground of your hearts, places where only a few privileged people were allowed to enter through family ties. I wanted to believe that I was worthy of your trust with every interaction I had with each of you. I know that when I started, I was a rookie, figuring out how to ask questions about your health to get the information I needed to care for you, but also to not make it feel as if I was prying too much. Through your interactions, the art of medicine became more of a theme, as I realized that part of the art was learning how to develop a therapeutic relationship with you through spending time with you and asking you the right questions. What I did not realize at the beginning, however, was that in entering into a relationship with you and gaining access to your vulnerability, I became vulnerable as well.<br /><br /> It was in those moments of vulnerability that I learned about the humanistic aspect of medicine and that part of my development in becoming a physician was learning how to feel things on a deeper level. You were not afraid to let me into the most painful moments of your lives, and you invited me to experience all that comes through these moments, out of deep trust. Whether it was being hugged by you out of appreciation even after I told you about a terminal diagnosis, or whether it was me sobbing after saying a final goodbye to a young cancer patient who touched me and numerous physicians and nurses with his grace while dealing with his illness, I realized that there was a purpose in that pain in terms of deepening my understanding of humanity and learning how that understanding could help me to care for you. You also allowed me to celebrate with you in the most joyful experiences of your lives. Whether it was being on call in the CCU when you got a call that you were going to receive a new heart after extended time on the transplant waiting list, or whether it was seeing you rejoicing after you got news that your cancer was in remission, it was these moments that caused me to continue to have hope for you, even when everything else was pointing to the contrary. It is this incredible tension between joy and pain that comes to the forefront in medicine depending on how the medical situation looks, and this tension is wrapped up in these moments of vulnerability that are usually kept close to the chest. However, in your hope to get better, you believed in my abilities, and you allowed me to tap into that vulnerability in a way that could allow me to help you. I realize how deep and sacred that is, and I am forever humbled and grateful to you for allowing me to enter into your world.<br /><br /> Now, as I finish my training, I am reflecting on the thousands of interactions I have had with all of you over the years, and I am realizing that who I am as a physician would not be remotely possible without you. Your willingness to let me into your world, even when it was scary and frustrating, has shaped me in ways that are still being revealed to me as I write this. I know that letting me in was your choice, and the fact that you chose to grant me access into your inner worlds is incredibly humbling. Who am I to be made privy to some of the deeper aspects of your lives that are usually reserved for your loved ones who have known you much longer than I have? But you believed in me, in the hope that my knowledge could help you to recover from your illness.<br /><br /> I look back on these interactions, and my heart is full knowing that your lives were changed in part because you let me into them. My heart is full because I know that with your willingness to let me into your world, you helped me not only become a better doctor, but a better person. I was made a better person than when I first met you, and for that, I am truly grateful. As I prepare to enter into the next phase of practicing as an attending, I will take these experiences with me and reflect on them. I will stand amazed by how someone like me, a stranger to many of you before you met me, could be allowed to enter into your world in the hope of you getting better. I can honestly say that because of these interactions, we were all made better because of them. I pray that as I continue, this sacred trust that you have entrusted to me will always be justified through how I care for you.<br /><br /> Sincerely,<br /><br /> A grateful physician<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />jackmac34/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 02.05.2017.

62	41	2	The complexity of the white coat	I was rotating through the emergency room during my second year of residency, and one of the patients had come in just for a cough, and part of her evaluation consisted of a CT scan of her chest. As one of my assigned patients, I was responsible for evaluating things from her lab reports to her imaging, and then informing her of any important findings. While I was talking to her, the radiologist called me to review the images with her. As we were scrolling through the images, instead of seeing healthy lung, we saw one nodule, then another, and then another one of many. By the time we finished reviewing the imaging, we realized that this was consistent with cancer, and that this would be a new diagnosis for her.<br /><br /> I was 27 years old at the time, and it did not seem right that someone as young as me would be conveying such sad news to a patient that was about as old as my mother. In medical school, I had this image of doctors as people who were able to find a solution to any medical problem, and that these solutions would be used to help prolong life, and in some instances save it. The white coats they wore seemed to be a sign of hope and possibility, and that is why my white coat felt a little heavier as I was walking back to this patient’s room to deliver this news that seemed to go against this spirit of hope and possibility. With each step, the coat felt like more of a burden, an unexpected feeling from a coat that seemed lighter at the beginning of my shift before this particular news.<br /><br /> When I arrived at her door, I asked her how she was doing. She said that she still had the cough but otherwise had no other complaints. Then, bracing myself for the potential reaction, I said that I wanted to talk to her about her imaging. To be honest, I don’t remember what I said next; all I remember are some of the questions I had in my mind during this conversation. How do I say this to her? Am I being too loud? Am I speaking too fast? Similar questions went through my mind and probably at some point, through some mangled way, I conveyed the news to her with as much sensitivity as I could muster while being a little flustered. As expected, she looked shocked and disappointed, but then what surprised me was that she then thanked me for this information. All she was asking about afterwards was what would the next steps be.<br /><br /> As I have gone through my medical training, I started to realize that the medical knowledge I was learning was a double-edged sword. With this information, in one respect, I could provide patients options in terms of treatable illness, but in another respect, I could tell patients that there was nothing further to do about their illness if it was terminal. It was the latter portion that made it difficult to see the white coat as a source of hope for people, but what was confusing to me at first was that because I was wearing this white coat, I was also obligated to convey information to patients related to a poor prognosis, depending on the amount of information that they wanted to hear.<br /><br /> In those moments, the coat felt like a burden at first, but then as I had more of these conversations, this piece of clothing started to change in front of my eyes in terms of its symbolism. It started to reflect the complexity of medicine, and that in this complexity, there would be moments of triumph and moments of sadness. The white coat just happened to be a part of all of those moments and in a way became a necessary piece of clothing in my mind when it came to medical conversations, particularly when it was regarding disappointing news. In that particular complexity, the white coat itself became complex.<br /><br /> Since that particular interaction, I have had more difficult conversation with patients with regards to prognosis.  In every single conversation, I was wearing a white coat with the thought that wearing it conveyed a sense of seriousness to my words, particularly when it came to a poor prognosis, and that this information had to be discussed with absolute honesty and compassion. What surprised me was that after I stated the situation, patients, and their families would then ask me about next steps, particularly when it came to patient comfort. I started to realize that somehow, with seeing me in the white coat, patients felt comfortable enough to ask me about what they should now expect with this news in terms of preparing for an ultimate progression of the illness to a terminal end. They showed me that even in their pain, they could believe that they could ultimately find comfort, and as such, the white coat became a source of hope and possibility to them again.<br /><br /> For me, with each similar interaction, the white coat becomes more complex, like an intricate puzzle that becomes more fascinating as new medical pieces are created through conversation.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ali McCarley/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 24.01.2017.

63	41	2	A physician’s letter to his younger self	To my younger self,<br /><br /> I remember how excited you were when you finally settled on medicine as the thing that you wanted to do as a career in your junior year of college. I remember all the questions you had about what the process entailed since no one in your family had undertaken this journey before. I even remember some of the doubts you had when you thought about how long of a journey it would be and whether you were up to it. Well, I write to you from thirteen years into the future, on the brink of finishing cardiology fellowship in less than a year. It is hard to believe that I can finally begin to see the light at the end of what has been a very long tunnel, but I have learned some things along the way that I thought would be helpful to you as you go along this journey.<br /><br /> Be prepared for the long haul. When I started out, I thought I had some idea of how long the journey was going to be. I knew it would be a few years until I became a medical doctor, but I did not realize how much time it would take to effectively train to become an independent doctor. Besides medical school, there is residency and potentially fellowship, entailing years and years of learning. There is a chance, however, that life may take you on a different detour. You may take time off between college and medical school, or you may decide to do focused specialization in one particular field for a few more years. Realize that you will meet many people along the way who have had interesting paths that they took to become physicians, and that there is wisdom to gain from interacting with them about their particular journeys. Also realize that even though you have an idea now of what you want to do, it may very well change as you go through different experiences, and that is OK. By the end, more than likely, your journey will be different than how you first envisioned it.<br /><br /> You don’t know everything, and that’s OK. As you go through your training, you will come across incredibly intelligent people who will challenge you to go further in your knowledge as you become a physician. There is so much to learn about medicine, and at times, it may be overwhelming. The more you learn along the way, the more you’ll realize that you don’t know, and that is OK. As you continue, you will realize that you are participating in what will be lifelong learning. New technologies will come along, old assumptions will change, and what you learn will be challenged for the better.<br /><br /> Appreciate your nurses. I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate the nurses that I have worked with over the years. As you go through training, you will see how valuable they are in terms of keeping you updated with what is going on with your patients. They are on the front lines, spending the most time with patients during their hospital stay; as a result of this, they may be aware of things about the patient that you may not know just by looking at labs and medications. Make sure to include them when it comes to figuring a care plan for the patients. Talk to them, and let them know how much you appreciate them. Trust me, you will grow to appreciate them when you find yourself in particular situations with some of your patients, and you’ll realize that sometimes, a crucial detail they provided had helped you to figure out the best course of action to take on a patient that wasn’t doing so well. I don’t think they get thanked enough for what they do, but they should be thanked for the care they provide and how crucial it is to how I can care for my patients. Along those lines …<br /><br /> You’re part of a team. As you get more exposure to patient care, you will realize that there are many people involved in the patient’s care besides you. More than likely, you’ll be interacting with other physicians, nurses, technicians, case managers, social workers, physical therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, secretaries, etc. Each person on the team plays an important role; try to learn their roles and also realize how your role fits into the care of the patient. At the end of the day, it all comes down to trust. They will be depending on you; learn also to depend on them, since you need them too.<br /><br /> It will be a challenging road. Taking care of patients is not easy at times, and it can be overwhelming, especially if you have a patient that is seriously ill and whose life may depend on some of the decisions that you make. It can be emotionally challenging at times when you consider the seriousness of what you will be doing, particularly if you deal with critically ill patients whose families are looking to you for hope. Also realize that at times, your time will not be your own. You may be woken up by a page letting you know that a patient is not doing so well, or you may have to work long, demanding hours. All this can be physically draining at times, and it will be important to try to take care of yourself. In the midst of all this …<br /><br /> Remember to remain human. At the end of the day, you’re not a superhero, even though some patients, families or staff may try to make you feel that way. You are a human being, full of emotions, desires, hopes, dreams and fears. At times, this may come into play in your medical journey, and that’s OK. Remember to maintain that humanity as you interact with patients, family members and colleagues. Never think of yourself greater than you are, but don’t doubt yourself more than you need to. At the end of the day, you are dealing with human beings always, not cases in a textbook. Come to your patients with humanity, and you will have more of a therapeutic impact than you realize. Come to family members and friends of patients with humanity, and you will help give them the hope they need in vulnerable times. Come to your colleagues with humanity, and they will strive to work with you to provide the best medical care you can as a team.<br /><br /> The list can go on, but I feel that for now, these are the most important things to consider in your journey. It is a worthwhile one that you are encountering, one that will change you in ways that you never would have imagined. Keep these things in mind, and you will enjoy a fruitful journey, one where you not only will become a physician, but you will become a better person than when you first started this journey. It may appear long, but this journey will come to an end sooner than you think. I wish you luck, and I look forward to hearing how the journey is going for you.<br /><br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> Sincerely yours,<br /><br /> You from the future<br /><br /> Chiduzie Madubata is a cardiology fellow.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Roberto Ferrari, flickr, CC BY-SA <br />Article last time updated on 30.08.2016.

64	41	2	Consequences of violating trust during residency	For many people in medical training, one period of time that they look forward to is the elective period. Most of the time, these periods are available for people to explore potential career opportunities, whether it is a certain subspecialty or a research opportunity. Usually, people are not on call and weekends are free, luxuries that are often sparse during the rigors of medical training.<br /><br /> Most of the time, one can take vacations during this period of time with the potential for recuperation. However, at times, one can be on backup call in the event that a colleague becomes sick and needs coverage.<br /><br /> In my experience, there is an honor code that underlies this type of system. I have had my fair share of being called in at times to cover an ailing colleague. The assumption is that the person calling out has a serious illness that makes it difficult for him or her to execute their medical duties. There is a trust involved between colleagues when it comes to these periods, especially since the times of a lighter schedule can be few and far between, and colleagues calling in for relief can take some of that time away. However, there are examples of that trust being violated, and in those situations, people have a tougher time trusting their colleagues if relief from duties is requested due to illness.<br /><br /> A powerful reminder of this took place near the end of my residency. One of the residents had called out sick, and another resident had to come in to do his particular shift. The resident that came in acted under the assumption that he was covering for an ailing colleague; however, a few days later, pictures of the resident that called out sick appeared on Facebook that same evening. He was out having a good time at a party while another resident was covering his shift in good faith. When word got around, the “sick” resident was chastised, and any further attempt to call out sick was looked at with suspicion.<br /><br /> When an incident like this happens, a lack of trust occurs, and the resident who called out sick inappropriately became an example of other people of whom residents on backup call were suspicious if they called out during particular ward months. It cuts into the ability of doctors to work together fully, to believe that their colleagues have their back in one of the toughest professions there is. Given the high-stress situations that we are in, the hope is that we can look at our colleagues when we are in the trenches and believe that they would watch out for us.<br /><br /> Another result of this is that it can cause other residents who do need to call out sick to keep working even though they need to recuperate from their illness, out of the fear that they would be labeled as a resident who may be trying to take advantage of others if they call out sick. This fear of not being trusted can cause other people to extend themselves further than physically possible, putting themselves and their patients at risk as they try to work through a debilitating illness.<br /><br /> At the end of the day, our patients are ultimately the ones who benefit from our professionalism. They depend on us to show up when necessary to offer our specialized skills to help them to get better, but they also expect us to use our judgment to act in ways that would allow us to treat them as effectively as possible. This means that if we are too sick to work, we step aside and allow our colleagues to care for our patients as we care for ourselves, but that if we are able to work, we do so to our fullest ability. There is an underlying integrity and teamwork that is expected among ourselves, and we are called upon to try to promote those traits among ourselves as we go through the workday.<br /><br /> As we continue to show up, no matter how tiring or frustrating it may be, these traits become stronger, and morale improves among the physician workforce. Trust builds up and teamwork becomes the norm, and as a result, we can execute our duties more effectively. At the end of the day, our patients will benefit, and that should be enough to spur us to continue to show up when we can to provide the best care we can.”<br /><br />Chiduzie Madubata is a cardiology fellow.  This article originally appeared in the ABIM Foundation.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />purplejavatroll, flickr, CC BY-SA <br />Article last time updated on 21.06.2016.

65	41	2	When the seemingly simple becomes complex	In medicine, the seemingly simple questions become the complex ones. “How’s it going?” It is a question that is frequently asked whenever we encounter friends and acquaintances. In a given day, we ask this question many times out of courtesy and we expect to hear short, affirmative answers, such as “Things are good,” or “It’s OK” as we continue to walk to where we need to go since we are pressed for time.<br /><br /> It is a question that could promote more discussion about another person’s life, particularly if events are less than optimal, but having that type of conversation takes time, and many times other responsibilities call for us. We usually assume that the other person may not have time to hear about what is really going on in our lives, so we provide succinct answers when we are asked this particular question. It seems like a simple question on the surface given the simple answers we frequently give, but there is a hidden complexity to this question that can emerge at certain moments if we pay close attention. Many times, these moments occur when we deal with sick patients, particularly those dealing with a terminal illness.<br /><br /> A few months ago, I admitted a patient who was being transferred to the hospital for further treatment of prostate cancer. Previous treatments did not slow the progression of the disease, and the hope was that we potentially had a new treatment that could help his disease.<br /><br /> When he arrived at the hospital, he was frail but trying to show that he had some energy. He and his wife sat up as I walked into the room, and after I introduced myself, one of the initial questions I asked was, “How’s it going?”<br /><br /> Having been used to hearing short answers, I expected the same thing from this patient. Instead, he talked about the journey that he went through dealing with this illness. He talked about the challenge of undergoing treatments for his prostate cancer and its accompanying symptoms, the emotions that he and his wife had when he heard about progression of his illness, and the hope he had about possible improvement after being transferred to another hospital. I had other clinical responsibilities to attend to, but I realized that taking the time to listen to him gave me an idea of how to care for him during this hospitalization and also helped me to empathize with his struggle with prostate cancer.<br /><br /> Before he answered this question the way he did, I saw the brief hesitation that we all have when we debate whether to share the challenging things going on in our lives, but he took the gamble in believing that a doctor would show interest. I knew at that point that expecting short answers to this question in this case would only do him a disservice while he was under my care and while he was dealing with his illness.<br /><br /> As his hospitalization progressed, he was seen by other specialists while images and tests were reviewed. During this time, I kept asking him standard questions to get a sense of how he was doing physically while he tried to maintain a positive attitude about everything. He admitted to feeling tired and having a decreased appetite, and he was concerned about the increasing swelling he saw in his legs as well as increased effort that was needed when he tried to breathe. But overall, he remained hopeful.<br /><br /> Eventually the cancer had metastasized, and no treatment options were available to slow the progression of the disease. The patient took the news in stride. Again I found myself asking, “how’s it going?” And again he answered. But the focus of the discussion was different. He did not talk much about how he felt physically, but instead he started talking more about how his family would handle the news. He was not focusing on himself anymore but chose to focus on others instead.<br /><br /> New assumptions of how he would answer my question were challenged again since the focus was different, and it provided a new challenge in terms of how to care for him since he was not bringing up his symptoms as much. He was becoming more fatigued and the leg swelling and shortness of breath was more pronounced, but he never brought it up in this conversation. All he thought about was the potential impact of this news on his family.<br /><br /> Near the end of his hospitalization, more family members showed up as they prepared themselves for the inevitable passing of their loved one. Informative and compassionate discussions with palliative care prompted a new outlook. When I went into the room, I saw a man who looked the weakest that he had been, barely having energy to even lift his head off of the bed. I sat next to him and asked him how it was going.<br /><br /> He was concerned about whether he would be comfortable and whether his symptoms would be controlled; he also talked about the challenge of preparing to leave his family and if they would be supported by the hospice team as he approached his final days. This turned out to be the longest conversation I had with him during the hospitalization, but I sensed a genuine gratitude from him for simply asking “How is it going?” My patient died the following day with family by his side.<br /><br /> This experience helped me to realize that a question that I ask daily, which seemed so simple at first, turned out to be the most complex.<br /><br /> It is an example of medicine turning a relatively simple thing on its head, and it is a reminder that in this field, simple answers become a rarity and complex answers become the norm. The good news is that both patients and doctors benefit from this complexity, should we choose to accept it.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />David Goehring, flickr, CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 07.06.2016.

66	41	2	Both patients and doctors are at the whim of uncontrolled time	Frequent are the calls we make to our loved ones letting them know that we have to miss a family gathering due to our schedules at the hospital. Many times have we had to reschedule lunches and dinners with friends due to a patient becoming unstable at the hospital. We make plans with people, but in our mind, each plan is with a large asterisk, a caveat that things may change suddenly if one of our patients requires extra care at a particular moment. At times, it can create a particular discomfort, a constant feeling that as much as we try to have control of our time, our time is not our own. It is not something that should surprise us; we signed up for a career where we are trained to handle emergencies that will take up our time at various moments. <br /><br /> But as much as health care providers are affected by this, I am realizing more that this concept of uncontrolled time also affects our patients. Most of our patients do not choose to come to the hospital, and they do not choose to have a particular illness occur at an inopportune time in their lives. Once they become hospitalized, they are at the whim of the hospital schedule. As they try to get comfortable sleeping in a hospital bed, they are awakened early in the morning for blood draws. Timing of their meals and medications may be different from what they are accustomed to. They try to have a moment of privacy in their rooms, only to have it interrupted by a group of physicians coming in to ask them how things are going. And sometimes, a particular diagnosis that they want delivered in a timely fashion may be delayed because it takes time to access all of the necessary information. This sensed lack of control can be frustrating to patients, and it is something we should keep in mind as we discuss their concerns.<br /><br /> As long as emergencies exist, time will be interrupted, and both patients and doctors will be at the whim of uncontrolled time. By its nature, an emergency occurs unexpectedly, causing a substantial deviation from the planned course of a day. But rather than lament the fact that another portion of our planned time is taken away, it is important to enter into the new time created with those moments. Though it is not something that many of us would be willing to choose once it becomes a reality, there is little that can be done to change the circumstances. A realization has to occur that, for such a time as this, we have the capability to deliver care to a patient whose time has also been interrupted, care that could potentially change their lives for the better. The more this realization is made and successfully carried out, the more likely that patients and health care providers will grow to appreciate the time they have and to make the most of it, since we do not know when next we will be reminded that at times, our time is not our own. <br /><br />Chiduzie Madubata is an internal medicine physician.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Michael Himbeault, flickr, CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 24.05.2016.

67	41	2	Navigating the prescription drug abuse epidemic	With increasing media coverage, the public is becoming more aware about the abuse potential of certain drugs and about things to watch out for in terms of signs of drug overdose. However, not as much attention has been focused on the challenges posed to the people legally allowed to prescribe these medications in the first place: the health care providers.<br /><br /> Certain health care providers (consisting of doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) have the ability to provide prescriptions of drugs to all patients that they come across, including certain drugs noted for their abuse potential, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine. These drugs are considered Schedule II drugs under the United States Controlled Substances Act, meaning that they have a high potential for abuse, and that they have accepted medical use with severe restrictions for treatment of certain conditions due to their abuse potential. Chronic pain is a common medical condition for numerous patients, whether from recent trauma leaving residual pain, or from progression of conditions that lead to nerve damage, such as diabetes. Many patients with chronic pain do not have a history of substance abuse, so prescribing these medications is less of an issue. It is when a patient with chronic pain and a history of substance abuse presents to the hospital that adequate treatment of pain becomes more challenging.<br /><br /> I saw this challenge first hand in experiences during my internal medicine residency training and my first year practicing independently as an attending physician. I trained and ultimately practiced in a state that has one of the highest rates of prescription drug overdose and accidental deaths in the country, so this challenge came up numerous times. Frequently, a patient would talk about a particular traumatic event that led to them having chronic pain, but a urine toxicology screen would also test positive for an illicit substance which indicated recent substance abuse. Instantly, the validity of the patient’s story would be called into question with the positive drug test, and the concern about potential prescription drug abuse began to surface. In that moment, physical exam findings and review of images became important in determining if there was any objective evidence substantiating the patient’s complaints. If not, the decision about whether or not to provide a prescription of pain medications became more difficult.<br /><br /> This is a common scenario faced by health care providers on a daily basis, whether in the inpatient or outpatient setting. We are expected by the general public to provide adequate health care to patients, addressing both acute and chronic problems. However, chronic pain is a challenging diagnosis to treat effectively due to the subjective nature of the complaint. The only person who knows how much pain one is in is the patient, and there are few tools available to adequately assess the complaints objectively besides physical exam findings and review of the medical record to substantiate those claims. If there is nothing that can be found, a decision has to be made in terms of whether or not to believe the pain complaints of the patient at that moment, and it never is an easy decision.<br /><br /> Far too often, there are previous situations that complicate the decision we have to make about providing pain medications. Sometimes, we have had patients with a clean drug test who present with chronic pain; unfortunately, they are later found to be abusing the medications we provided to treat their pain. Other times, we take care of patients with a recent substance abuse history that we are reluctant to give pain medications, but they turn out to have an actual medical issue leading to their current pain. It frequently feels like a guessing game, only the stakes are higher given the potency of these medications.<br /><br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> Schedule II drugs are a double-edged sword; they can be very effective in providing comfort for the patient who struggles with pain, but they can also be addictive and potentially life-threatening. The medicolegal ramifications are all too familiar to us since we know that we can be held liable for not adequately treating pain in the eyes of a patient. Also, if an adverse event that happens to a patient is attributed to a prescription of what is thought to be an excess amount of pain medications, we could be held responsible for that event. The potential threats to our livelihood in these situations ultimately leaves us in a tough predicament when the issue of prescribing pain medications arises, and at the end of the day, we can only hope to make the right decision when it comes to treating our chronic pain patients. Hopefully we are not burdened with fear when these decisions have to be made.<br /><br /> A quote that comes to mind is one that I hear periodically at church, that we are supposed to be “wise as serpents and gentle as doves.” I believe this can be applied to all health care providers when it comes to how we navigate the prescription drug epidemic. We have to be wise about the reality of prescription drug abuse in our society, but at the end of the day, we need to provide effective and compassionate medical care to our patients when it comes to chronic pain. Perhaps focusing mostly on the medical presentation, and not focusing as much on the social situations in which patients find themselves, may help us to better navigate these challenging waters.<br /><br />Chiduzie Madubata is an internal medicine physician.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />phrawr, flickr, CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 03.05.2016.

68	41	2	A musician’s guide to medical training	I began to realize that musical training has many parallels to medical training. If one looks hard enough at the journey of a musician, there are insights about medical training that physicians could learn.<br /><br />1. Medical school. When you start to learn an instrument, initially there is a lot of excitement. You imagine yourself playing pieces that you grow up hearing on the radio and you think that you’ll be given pieces to learn right away. However, instead of music, your teachers just give you exercises. You’re asked to practice your scales, learn music theory and develop proper technique for months on end. This is different from what you imagined when you signed up for this. At first, these exercises seem repetitive, boring and difficult. At moments, you consider quitting since these exercises aren’t fun. But over time, the exercises become easier with more practice. Proper technique starts to become second nature, and you get to the point where learning music will become much easier.<br /><br />2. Intern year. After you’ve spent a few lessons learning the fundamentals, you’re ready to start learning music, but the music is not as exciting as what you have heard on the radio. It is just basic music to solidify the fundamentals. At this point, your teacher is emphasizing accuracy. You’re focusing on getting the notes right on the page, playing the piece at the right tempo, and maintaining the right type of dynamics. There may be a temptation to deviate from what is on the page or to learn harder music than you’re ready for, but an early deviation from the original lesson plan will lead to missing out on learning how to apply the fundamentals correctly, and ultimately you’ll start to learn the music the wrong way. This is a period of crucial formation as a musician, since you are forming practicing habits that will ultimately stick with you, and it is the time to receive feedback in terms of improving your technique with particular areas of focus. It may seem mechanical at times, but to get to the next level as a musician, this stage has to be mastered.<br /><br />3. Residency. Now you’re at the next level of being a musician; you’ve learned the fundamentals and have mastered the simple pieces. Now your teacher thinks you’re ready to play full pieces by different composers. You’re beginning to learn some of the classical pieces you have heard on the radio, but there’s a slight change: your teacher is giving you more freedom. Your teacher is not focused on you getting the notes right since it is assumed you’ll get them right, but now, he is asking you to think musically and to look beyond the page of notes. You’re expected to use your creativity to bring life to the music, and you will be expected to draw upon previous lessons to figure out what to do with the music in front of you. Your teacher will help you if you need it, but your goal now is to think about how you would interpret the music.<br /><br /> You may come across beginning musicians who will ask your advice about interpreting pieces since you have more experience. The goal is for you to become an independent musician, and you’ll start to figure out which direction you want to take your musical career. Periodically there are recitals, initially with other students of your teacher, but the goal is for you to give solo recitals, since you’ll be doing that more as your career progresses.<br /><br />4. Fellowship. If you decide to focus more on a particular composer or period of music, there are opportunities to do so. However, before anyone takes you under their wing, you have to demonstrate competency in general music training. If you want to focus on improvisation, you will have to demonstrate an understanding of music theory and have a good amount of music under your belt. If you want to focus on Bach exclusively, you will have to have played a certain number of pieces by him that demonstrate a general understanding of his pieces. This is the time to learn the nuances of a certain type of music that few people truly understand. You may have to travel to a different country to learn from the experts, since the number of people at this level are few and far between. You will continue to give solo recitals and will likely have students of your own, but there is an expectation that you will be able to talk more intelligently about the music you are focusing on.<br /><br />5. The beginning attending. Finally, you’ve finished your musical training after many years and you’re ready to take the world by storm. You bring your own flavor to the pieces that you’re now interpreting, drawing upon advice given by your teachers and other musicians you have met over the years. You start to realize that other musicians will interpret the same piece differently, reflecting the influence of their particular teachers. There is a temptation to be bold and interpret pieces in a new way, but you have to keep in mind that as you perform your recitals, your playing is subjectively being analyzed by other musicians, some of whom will have a particular way of interpreting the same pieces that you have played.<br /><br /> You will be held to a higher standard of musical interpretation since you have so many years of experience behind you. Solo recitals will continue at larger venues with more feedback from the public. It may be overwhelming (especially if the criticism isn’t so great), but trust your instincts and the teachers who have guided you. You have your own students who are looking to you for guidance, and you realize that after learning music for so long, you actually have something to teach.<br /><br />6. The veteran attending. You’ve seen it all (or at least you think you have). You have been playing for many years and have traveled around the world to demonstrate your interpretation of pieces. Whether you like to admit it or not, you have your favorite pieces that you interpret in a certain way. There is not as much time to learn new pieces as before, so you’re drawing upon your musical experiences from the past couple of decades. You may be focusing on education or performance at this point, or maybe a bit of both.<br /><br /> Inevitably, you’ll come across a musician that is beginning on his own, coming from one of the top musical conservatories in the country. You’re intrigued and you listen to him, realizing that he is playing a piece that you have played years ago. Initially, you notice how different the interpretation is, and the temptation is to tell the musician to change the interpretation of the piece to make it sound as if you were playing it.<br /><br /> But then you step back and really listen, and you find that it is beautiful, but in a different way. You just learned something new about a piece that you thought you knew. The new musician hears about your experience and asks you what you think about how he interpreted the piece, since he knows that you have a reputation of playing this piece incredibly in the past. It is at that point that you realize that no matter how long you have been playing music, you realize that every musician has something to learn from one another.<br /><br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> Chiduzie Madubata is an internal medicine physician.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Marcelo Campi, flickr, CC BY-SA <br />Article last time updated on 26.04.2016.

69	41	2	Being a whole doctor serves patients best	From an early age, I was encouraged by my family to consider a career in medicine. I was told it was a well-respected profession, offering financial security and community respect. Seeing the white coats, stethoscopes, and grateful patients at my childhood doctors’ visits made the field mysterious and intriguing, and these stuck with me as I grew older. I also developed a love for music at an early age; I sang in a church choir and learned how to play the saxophone. However, it was the pipe organ that truly captured my interest when I was a teenager.  I started dreaming of giving public performances and playing in world-famous concert halls and cathedrals. The same mystery and intrigue surfaced again, but this time it was in the form of reverberating sounds in a large cathedral as the organ played its last notes. In the back of my mind, I started to wonder whether music could be compatible with a career in medicine and I entered college trying to make that a reality.<br /> At fifteen, I started taking lessons on the pipe organ, and during college I began to take music more seriously. While I was studying for my pre-medicine courses, I also spent one to two hours daily practicing the pipe organ. I found that I liked my pre-medicine courses and playing music equally, and I found that with the stress of upcoming exams, it was sitting at the pipe organ that provided a natural refuge for me. By the time I graduated, I had a few recitals under my belt and I was gaining a reputation as an organist in the Boston area. If medicine had not worked out, a career as a professional organist with graduate study at a music conservatory was a serious consideration.<br /><br /> However, I started to realize during college that one needed to devote a lot of time in order to become a good doctor, and that studying hard for exams in my pre-medicine courses was only a glimpse of the amount of time I would have to put in my studies to become a physician. I thought that my dream of becoming both a successful organist and successful doctor was becoming less realistic, and I had to make a choice between medicine and music. I ultimately chose medicine, and prior to entering medical school, I made a decision to put music performance on hold.<br /> Medical school was everything that I thought it would be: busy, hard, and stressful. I spent more time than I ever imagined studying for exams, and the long hours and frequent changes in my sleep cycle during my third year medical rotations made for periodic tense conversations between me and my loved ones. Without music, I felt incomplete, and a constant restlessness developed that started to affect my ability to fully care for my patients. It did not make matters easier that I kept on thinking about being a musician and the thrill of public performances that I missed.<br /><br /> It was in medical school that I realized how much of a part music had played in my life and how important it was to me, but I had thought that in order to become a good doctor, that part of my life had to be sacrificed. But when I went in to see my patients, I was not coming with my whole self, but only a part of my self. It was difficult for me to have full conversations with my patients or to be fully invested in my training because I felt incomplete. At times, I wondered why I had entered into medicine in the first place and thought about how things would be different if I had pursued a career in music. My dissatisfaction with medicine was at its highest in medical school, and I wondered if part of that dissatisfaction was due to leaving out such an important part of my life for the sake of medicine.<br /> Burnout in the medical profession is a significant concern given the demands on our time by patients and other colleagues, and little time for self-care. I saw signs of this in myself during medical school, as well as in other medical students and residents that I worked with in the form of fatigue, decreased concentration and irritability. Most of the time, decreased sleep, long work hours and little time for leisure would contribute to burnout, and sometimes their ability to care for patients was compromised. Unfortunately, this is a significant problem in training programs due to the prevalence of burnout among trainees.<br /> As awareness of this has grown, residency programs are now trying to implement strategies within their training to improve the experiences of medical students and residents to reduce the prevalence of burnout, such as establishing mentoring networks, counseling sessions and night float systems to provide avenues to discuss concerns and manage workload. Individual strategies such as yoga, music, reflective writing and spiritual activities have also been encouraged to improve burnout rates during training; further studies will need to be done to assess the effectiveness of these strategies.<br /> During the lighter schedule of fourth year of medical school, I decided to take up playing the organ again. I immediately felt the change in my perspective of pursuing medicine and seeing patients. With music back in my life, I started to feel whole again, and this time I was not planning on letting it go. I sought ways of cultivating music despite my residency training and it ultimately became a source of stress relief, especially during the busy months. I used more time outside of the hospital to focus on music but I noticed that even though I was busier and saw more patients, I felt less burned out. I had more fulfilling conversations with my patients, I was connecting with my colleagues and patients on a deeper level, and I started to enjoy being a doctor again.<br /> I realized that bringing all aspects of my life to medicine was making a difference, and despite a busy schedule, I was able to start performing the pipe organ publicly again. Despite the increased time required to integrate music back into my life, my medical training did not suffer; I completed residency and passed my internal medicine boards this year. My dream of bringing music and medicine together is starting to become a reality, and I look forward to pursuing this dream as I start cardiology fellowship in a few months. Being a whole doctor serves my patients best, even if a non-medical portion of my life plays one of the biggest parts.<br />  <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Calvin Wray, flickr, CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 29.03.2016.

70	42	2	Emotional Effect on Women That Have an Abortion	In general, we find that abortion is very stressful for women. It is not easy when they decide to terminate a pregnancy. First of all, falling pregnant can already be stressful, especially if it comes with certain medical problems, when it’s unwanted, or even in rape cases.<br /><br /> Furthermore, we find that directly after a woman has had an abortion, she might experience unexpected emotions and reactions. Sometimes it’s also difficult to discuss it due to religious and cultural reasons. Many women might feel emotional distress and guilt caused by religious beliefs that normally creates a stigma concerning abortions.<br /><br /> However, most emotional and psychological responses related to an abortion is normal. Yet, it shouldn’t be severe or persistent enough to affect their daily lifestyle, it typically fades on its own.<br /><br />Some of these feelings naturally can include the following:<br /><br /> Loss of her self-esteem<br /><br /> Stress that can reduce her ability to cope<br /><br /> Regret or remorse<br /><br /> Guilt<br /><br /> Grief due to the sense of loss<br /><br /> Relief or anxiety<br /><br /> Not every woman will experience emotional responses that are negative with an abortion. Those that do shouldn’t have problems concerning their mental health that is lasting. Some might react positive and feel relief without any regrets. This is because they feel confident that their decision was a choice that is right for them. <br /><br /> About depression<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a mental or psychological condition of your health, also known as a mood disorder.<br /><br /> Some symptoms and signs you might experience when you are depressed can include:<br /><br /> Sleep patterns that are disturbed<br /><br /> Losing interest in any activities you used to enjoy<br /><br /> Lose your interest in having intercourse<br /><br /> Tiredness or lack of energy<br /><br /> Irritable feelings<br /><br /> Feeling guilty<br /><br /> Concentration that is poor, plus finds it difficult to make decisions<br /><br /> Your ability to think can be reduced<br /><br /> Experiencing sadness or feeling low<br /><br /> Depression can develop at various severity levels. Women that have a mild condition will be able to perform her activities daily with some ease. However, when depression is severe it can affect her life so dramatically that she won’t be able to work. It may also cause other mental issues that are more serious, like psychosis.<br /><br /> Feelings of self-harm or suicide are symptoms that are very serious and they will need help urgently. Depression may not be a reason for physical changes but sometimes depressed patients can talk very slowly. It might also have other effects such as loss of appetite which could cause loss of weight and even anorexia or bulimia.<br /><br /> Grief or depression due to an abortion<br /><br /> Grief is a reaction that is naturally occurring with the death of a loved one, but it shouldn’t cause depression over a long term.<br /><br /> To experience loss after termination of an unplanned pregnancy can also be natural, like due to an injury or illness. Yet, in this case, because of a spontaneous abortion, the symptoms might not last very long.<br /><br /> Most of the time, even if a woman decides on an abortion to terminate a pregnancy, she will still experience feelings that are natural of regret, guilt, grief, sadness, and loss afterward.<br /><br /> Risk factors for depression<br /><br /> Women with mental disorders prior to unwanted pregnancies who goes for an abortion can experience it differently as what healthy women would. They might be at a higher risk to develop depression after the procedure.<br /><br />These risk factors may include:<br /><br /> If they previously had childbirth that was unwanted<br /><br /> In the case of alcohol or drug use<br /><br /> A history of emotional or violence problems<br /><br /> With poverty<br /><br /> Genetics can also be linked to a very high risk of developing depression after an abortion. This means if any of their relatives also experienced depression as an illness factor, it will be more likely for a woman to experience it herself.<br /><br /> Specific events in life may trigger depressive episodes. These include such as rape or physical abuse and it can trigger depression that is severe after an abortion as it may cause a feeling of loss and separation.<br /><br /> It’s important for any woman making the choice to go for an abortion, no matter what the reason might be, to consult a professional for help before and after the procedure. Doctors have the experience to help you understand what you can expect during the abortion and afterward. and may recommend sessions with professional staff to help you through this emotional time.<br />Article last time updated on 01.01.2018.

72	42	2	Treatments Used in Dental Habit Therapy That Can Help Your Child	It’s possible for anyone to develop bad habits during their life. In some cases, young children may have bad habits that could actually influence the function and development of their mouth, teeth, and jaws. Examples of this can be thumb sucking, mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting that are persistent.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The reflex of sucking can be a natural occurrence among children at an early age, which normally disappears between the ages of two and four years. However, if the problem persists after four years, the pressure on their upper jaw and front teeth may cause teeth to start moving apart. Plus, it can result in the jaw changing its shape. This conditions might impair their speech and also cause an open bite problem.<br /><br /> With mouth breathing, which relates to a pattern of breathing that is not normal, causing their mouths to remain always open. This can pass direct air into the lungs, and cause muscular alteration functions of their face and tongue. The lower and upper jaw may abnormally grow and cause orthodontic conditions that can be serious.<br /><br /> Some issues that will need habit therapy among children<br /><br /> Two issues that are known to be the biggest problem in children concerning bad habits can include finger or thumb sucking, plus tongue thrusting. The thrusting of the tongue can occur if a child pushes his/her tongue forward onto the teeth constantly. Most of the time they will outgrow such a habit at around four years old. Although, if it doesn’t happen, it may cause their teeth to misalign.<br /><br /> Side effects from misalignment might seriously affect how a child’s face looks. It’s important that you consult a professional dentist for correcting the problems since the child at such a young age won’t understand any of the consequences.<br /><br /> Thumb sucking treatment using orthodontic appliances<br /><br /><br /><br /> When your child persistently sucks his/her thumb, consider getting orthodontic treatment early for stopping this behavior, as well as preventing problems from developing. It’s important to help the child understand what problems can be associated with this habit and suggest different ways to stop it.<br /><br /> Different ways to try and stop the habit may include reminding them about the dangers of the habit. Additionally, at night time place a hand puppet, sock or mitten over the hand. Furthermore, consider using an elbow elastic support that might make it difficult for bending his/her elbow to prevent thumb sucking. Sometimes, these habits are an emotional comfort device and scolding can only worsen the situation.<br /><br /> However, when it doesn’t help, your dentist may suggest an orthodontic appliance, known as a tongue crib which painlessly and gently will stop thumb sucking completely. This treatment can physically prevent the habit and typically, your child’s habit should be over within a couple of months if wearing this appliance.<br /><br /> Treatment appliances for tongue thrusting<br /><br /> This habit happens when your child pushes his or her tongue against the teeth in front while they are swallowing or speaking. A parent might feel it’s not a big issue, though, as time goes by the pressure that is exerted through their tongue onto the teeth may relate to orthodontic open bite problems.<br /><br /> An appliance for tongue thrusting will correct such behavior and prevent the child from thrusting his/her tongue against the teeth. Thus, it can allow the teeth to develop as it should.<br /><br /> This appliance can be placed in a comfortable and safe way to correct the child’s habit. It’s a semi-permanent attachment to the teeth very similar to the way braces are fitted. For the duration it is worn, it will guide the child to correct his/her patterns of behavior. Sometimes it might also be recommended for a child to get a speech or exercise therapy together with such a dental appliance.<br /><br /> Sometimes success can be reached after only a couple of days. All the same, the time it takes doesn’t really matter because once the orthodontist can confirm your child is over the habit, they will remove the appliance. It’s very similar to a palatal crib which may typically be used for preventing a child to suck his/her thumb, it only differs from what this crib actually blocks.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

73	42	2	What Platelet Lysate Treatments Do	Normally Platelets found in the body releases in a slow manner some growth factors to promote healing. Granting, at times the doctor might need to contain these growth factors within platelets so that it’s immediately accessible for promoting healing faster. This is used in areas that are affected by disease or damage.<br /><br /> However, in certain areas of your body where doctors use PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, it might cause a lot of inflammation. Therefore, they prefer to create a Platelet Lysate solution. This is done by cracking the Platelets open and allowing all growth factors to promptly be released into your body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a purely concentrated solution of the growth factors found in plasma once platelets were removed and activated. This regenerative solution that doctor’s use has minimal inflammatory reactions and it’s immediately very active. It’s a preferred solution to treat areas of injured nerves, new stem cells, and in your epidural space.<br /><br /> How effective is therapy with Platelet Lysate?<br /><br /> This procedure can provide relief for a variety of conditions, although, it may vary in effectiveness. It helps the body to do what comes naturally, yet, because every patient’s healing process is different, it will reflect those results. This means that some patients might only need a single treatment, where others will require additional treatments.<br /><br /> Additionally, the reaction may depend on the following factors.<br /><br /> Different conditions or health factors that may attribute to slow healing<br /><br /> Activities after the treatment<br /><br /> Your overall health condition<br /><br /> Response and status of your immune system<br /><br /> Degrees of the damage<br /><br /> The specific area that is damaged<br /><br /> A patient’s age<br /><br /> Advantages of this therapy<br /><br /> There are many advantages with such an innovative therapy which can outweigh problems commonly related to different treatments like steroid injections or surgeries.<br /><br /> Advantages of Platelet Lysate therapy may include the following:<br /><br /> It’s related to healing over the long-term<br /><br /> Easy to perform and prepare<br /><br /> Less inflammatory effects<br /><br /> Recovery periods can be short<br /><br /> Natural cell regeneration<br /><br /> Using a person’s own power of healing<br /><br /> Non-invasive procedure<br /><br /> Such a procedure speeds up the process of natural healing due to the fact that growth factors can be available immediately to tissues that are damaged. It will be directly injected into the area that is damaged, immediately starting the process of healing.<br /><br /> It’s possible to apply Platelet Lysate treatment therapy any number of times. This will depend on what your body may need. When experiencing great improvement its fine to slow down or even stop treatments. On the other hand, when the body is in need of extra support, there won’t be a problem to carry on with the treatment.<br /><br /><br /><br /> About advanced PRP and Platelet Lysate procedures<br /><br /> Treatments with injections of PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, as well as Platelet Lysate contains components of healing and growths that is collected from a person’s own blood. This is used to increase the body’s ability of naturally repairing itself.<br /><br /> These procedures can be used to repair muscle, ligament, tendon, and joint injuries. Thus, it has become very popular among professional athletes. The injections are very effective due to the fact that it stimulates stem cells in the area that is targeted. It promotes those cells to work harder on tissue that is damaged for quicker healing. It is generally used for conditions of the spine, injuries of soft tissues, and mild arthritis.<br /><br /> The procedure of Platelet Lysate therapy<br /><br /> This procedure has less pain and fewer complications than what surgery offers. The doctor will discuss your condition and how the therapy can help you. Together a decision might be made whether it may be right for you.<br /><br /> It’s a fairly simple procedure and the following steps can be done:<br /><br /> To re-inject a mixture of Platelet Lysate into tissues that are damaged, cells are removed from a person’s own blood.<br /><br /> A tiny sample of the blood gets collected to separate platelets out of other components of the blood in order to create PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma.<br /><br /> This will then be subjected to a couple of series of freezing and thawing cycles. This carefully breaks the platelets apart to release its growth factors.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The Platelet Lysate results can then be combined together with just a tiny quantity of some anti-inflammatory medication such as Dexamethasone prior to being injected. Once done, it is injected into the area that is damaged using fluoroscopy or ultrasound which is guided techniques.<br /><br /> Once the procedure is done, you need to plan for enough rest, plus restricting activities for at least forty-eight hours. It might take some time before you will realize that the treatment is working. But once your activities or movements increases and you experience less pain you will know. You can decrease or increase treatments depending on how you feel.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-10 00:00:00	349	m2m
74	42	2	Can Perineal Massage Help You Avoid the Episiotomy?	Labor is a very painful and intense ordeal. The duration of this experience depends a lot on the strength of the contractions, the size of the baby, and the anatomy of the birth canal. The perineum is the area of the body between the anus and the vulva. You should rub or knead the muscles in order to relieve muscle tension. Perineal massage consists in rubbing or kneading the perineal muscles of a pregnant woman in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to allow these muscles and the surrounding tissue of the birth canal to stretch and relax prior delivery so an episiotomy can be avoided. When the canal birth is too narrow and when the baby is putting too much pressure on this area during childbirth, an episiotomy is required. An episiotomy is a cutting of the muscular area, commonly known as the perineum in order to help enlarge the vaginal opening during childbirth.<br /><br /> This area is exactly located between the vagina and the anus. It is normally done when the perineum is too rigid and too tight to allow a normal and easy delivery. It is also done to prevent tearing of the perineal wall as the baby tries to pass through the birth canal. It is also performed in order to allow a fast delivery of the baby. An episiotomy is seen as a necessary evil because, despite the practical reasons for doing it, it leads to some extra pain and discomfort after birth.<br /><br /> This can last up to a couple of days or a couple of weeks. It also changes the structure of the perineum permanently, as most of the muscles get replaced by a scar tissue. To reduce the possibility of an episiotomy, or a perineal tear, several practices have been tried over the years, and perineal massage is one of those. Perineal massage has a long and rich history, with the Chukchi Eskimos in Siberia using glass bottles and African tribes using gourds.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to increase the size of the vaginal canal and to increase the elasticity of the perineal area. The beautiful thing about a perineal massage is that it is relatively easy to perform. It does not require any special equipment, and you or your partner can do it in the absence of any medical professional. The massage is preferably done after taking a bath. You will need to take a comfortable position, wash your hands and lubricate your thumb with a water-based lubricant.<br /><br /> You can choose natural lubricants like olive oil or almond oil if you prefer. Once the hands are cleaned and lubricated, you need to place the thumb inside the vagina. The thumb should be inserted until the first knuckle of it is at the same level with the mouth of the vagina. This means that about 1-1.5 inches of your thumb would be inserted into the vagina. With the thumbs still in the vagina, push downwards towards the direction of the anus, and outwards towards the sides.<br /><br /> Keep pushing till you feel a burning and a stretching sensation. Hold your thumbs in place at this point for a minute or two. After that move your thumbs in around the lower half of the vagina by moving in a “U” shape from side to side for about 10 minutes. That way you will massage the side walls and the base of the vagina as well. Like massages on every other part of the body, it is not a one-time procedure, but should be done repeatedly.<br /><br /> Some experts recommend 6-10 sessions starting from 4-6 weeks before expected due date and continuing until the child is born. Interestingly, the upper half of the vagina does not need to be massaged, as it is surrounded by bones. The urethra is also found in this area, and any attempt to massage it may lead to some level of discomfort and even urinary tract infections.<br /><br /> You will want to avoid the upper half of the vagina during the perineal massage as you won’t have any profit from it. Women have reported an increase in the width of their birth canal with each session of perineal massage. Certain researchers have also been conducted in order to show the effectiveness of the perineal massage in preventing perineal tears and episiotomy during delivery.<br /><br /> One of such research's in the UK noted that there was a 6.1% reduction in second and third - degree tears. And there were episiotomies in women who did perineal massage during the last month of their pregnancy. The effects were higher in women over the age of 30 years old who were having their first baby. This is probably because of the fact that older women normally have a more rigid perineum compared to women at their 20’s.<br /><br /> The perineal massage helps widen the birth canal and make its walls more elastic and less likely to tear. In younger women who were having their first babies, the effect on their still elastic perineum is minimal. For women who have had previous episiotomies and women who had perineal tears in their previous pregnancies, perineal massage does not have much effect. This is due to the fact that the scar tissue is already formed by the previous damage to the perineum.<br /><br /> Normally, this scar tissue is not that strong as the muscle is. Therefore, despite the massage, there is a minimal change in the width of their birth canal. However, these women can still need an episiotomy during the childbirth. Despite the effectiveness of the perineal massage, there are some people who it is not recommended for. These include women who have had preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes in the past, or currently have a vaginal infection.<br /><br /> It is also wise to stop perineal massage if it causes discomfort or stimulates contraction. Whether or not you decide to try the perineal massage, it is very important that you keep your appointments with your obstetrician. No amount of personal research can replace the competence of a skilled physician.<br /><br /><br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-01 00:00:00	379	m2m
75	42	2	Why Would Couples Choose a Procedure for Gender Selection?	Most couples would like to have children of both sexes, especially in our current way of life where more and more people prefer smaller families. This is due to the fact that everything is so expensive. With today technology it’s possible for doctors through fertility treatments that are more advanced, to identify female and male embryos.<br /><br /> This option is available to couples today. In addition, couples can now also avoid passing on genetic sex-linked disorders to their children. The same goes for parents that want to balance their family and already have a child or children of one sex. Choosing a child’s gender has been subjected to a variety of debates quite extensively due to ART/assisted reproductive technology since it started.<br /><br /><br /><br /> I was very lucky through the conventional way to have two children and one of each gender. Yet, many couples might try for conceiving a boy or a girl and don’t see success until maybe the fifth time. By selecting your baby’s gender which is also called family balancing, it’s possible to have both sexes and keep the family smaller. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> In certain countries, this procedure might only be permitted for preventing transmission of genetic sex-linked diseases. Although, in others, it can be a practice that is common in fertility clinics.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> During development of an embryo, the differentiation of gender may occur prior to fertilization. It’s usually determined by the contribution of genetic material of a father’s sperm because he carries an X and Y chromosome which is responsible for a baby’s gender. Women’s egg cells carry only the X chromosome which means the combination can either be XX for a girl and XY for a boy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to this factor, selecting a gender may involve manipulation during an early stage of embryonic development or fertilization. Techniques of assisted reproduction can allow couples in choosing their baby’s gender during these specific stages.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Stages may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br />Before you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This involves a procedure to choose a sperm for a couple’s desired gender prior to fertilization and allow the fertility doctor to perform it without using IVF. <br /><br />  <br /><br />After you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The doctor selects an embryo for the gender that is desired directly after it’s fertilized and then transfers the embryo back into the uterus of the mother.<br /><br />  <br /><br />While a woman is pregnant<br /><br /><br /><br /> In this case, a woman can voluntarily terminate her pregnancy, if the baby is not the gender they desire, which is called sex-selective abortion.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to reasons that are ethical, this type of abortion won’t be a recommended technique in choosing an unborn baby’s gender. Although, woman have the option to choose a VTOP/voluntary termination of pregnancy, which will purely depend on their choice.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Couples that choose a procedure to select the gender of their new baby will very often have opinions like these listed below.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Some couples believe if they have lost a child they can choose gender. Choosing a gender that is the same for their new baby won’t replace the one they have lost, but it might help them to work through the loss.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s been suggested that when a parent receives the gender of their choice, they can love the child more, but that is not really relevant to everyone.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This procedure may help in preventing any gender-related diseases of being transmitted to the new baby, which can benefit the child and the parent.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> New parents that plan for balancing their family with fewer children in this economy, might prefer selecting their children as it will be easier to provide them with what they need.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> For a part of the community that doesn’t believe in choosing your child’s gender, it can raise the following points as listed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> They feel it’s not really necessary and very expensive, as well as the fact that it won’t increase the likelihood to fall pregnant.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s not always a hundred percent accurate except when the chosen technique is IVF together with PGD to select the gender, but it’s the option that is most expensive.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Most couples prefer to guess their baby’s gender while pregnant. Thus, by choosing the gender up front, it can eliminate the surprise element. However, a couple that wants a boy and a girl, who after four tries, just have either boys or girls, won’t agree with a guessing game.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Sometimes others might say it may contribute to inequality of gender and cause an imbalance.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2017.

76	42	2	How Can Osseous Surgery Benefit You	Generally, to live a healthy life, your oral health plays an important role. A mouth that is clean is not just necessary for appearance and to eat with comfort, but it also will reduce the risk to develop infection and disease. With any periodontal disease, bacteria within the mouth may easily be carried into different areas of the body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You should consult your dentist for assistance in regards to reclaiming your oral hygiene. Thus, keeping it at a level that is high. It’s important to fill cavities, plus remove any teeth that can’t be repaired. To do so, you also might need treatments like osseous surgery to reach your goal. In order to undergo this specific procedure, it’s necessary to understand what it entitles, as well as the benefits and risks.<br /><br /> About osseous surgery and the reason for doing it<br /><br /> People that suffer from a periodontal disease will be at risk that their teeth, gums, and bone can be destroyed. This disease causes pockets to form around teeth, which is very common and it can spread to other teeth as well. Additionally, it can develop into a breeding ground that increases infections throughout the body. With a mouth that is healthy, gums fit snugly against the teeth to prevent bacteria and food of reaching the area below the gum line.<br /><br /> In the beginning of this condition, it is easier to remove debris from problem areas, but as time goes by, treatment may be difficult, or sometimes even impossible to correct. The dentist will be able to clean the pockets through a reduction surgery for pocket depth’s and prevent further damage along with any infections. It can help you to keep a healthy and cleaner mouth, provided that you maintain good routines of oral health and go for dental cleanings regularly.<br /><br /> The main aim of osseous surgery is to remove all bacteria and debris from your pockets. Gum tissue will be folded back to expose the area around your tooth to clean it. If the tissue of your bone is also damaged, the dentist can smooth it as well. Bacteria can grow and hide even in the smallest of irregularities of your bone. This procedure can allow the tissue of the gum to reattach to the bone that is healthy more effectively.<br /><br /> Afterwards, your dentist can remove some extra tissue of the gum and use tiny stitches to keep your gum in its place to allow for natural healing. Sometimes, they might use a special kind of bandage for dentals.<br /><br /> It’s possible to experience swelling after your surgery, therefore you should apply on the outside an ice pack covering the area that is treated. This will help to reduce any discomfort. Your dentist might also prescribe antibiotics for prior, during, as well as after you have had your treatment.<br /><br /> Some risks factors<br /><br /> The same as any other surgical procedure, osseous surgery can also have risks. Even if you take proper care of your mouth, there might be a chance of infection to develop within the area. Although, by keeping up good oral care and if aftercare is performed properly, it may minimize your risk.<br /><br /> Additionally, gum tissue around your teeth that are treated can recede faster than the rest of the gums. This can cause your treated teeth to look as if they are longer than what the other teeth are. However, when this happens your dentist will be able to treat it.<br /><br /> Different risks might include sensitivities that can increase towards temperatures. It may be necessary to drink beverages that are cold through a straw and to avoid chewing foods that are very hot with your treated teeth. Because these teeth may be at a higher risk for cavities that is root-based, it’s very important to maintain oral care at a level that is high. <br /><br /> Benefits of this surgery<br /><br /> Recovery is easy and fast<br /><br /> Prevent future bacteria buildup<br /><br /> It can smooth a service that is irregular<br /><br /> Damage can be prevented<br /><br /> Attacking all bacteria<br /><br /> Pocket depth can be reduced<br /><br /> Your gums and teeth should fit together snugly in order to protect teeth from every type of infection. Your dentist can provide the necessary treatments for restoring your oral health to what it should be. Always remember, follow up appointments is very important to keep your mouth healthy and ensure that it heals properly.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

77	42	2	And So Our Holiday Truly Starts	My heart starts to race excitedly and the plane starts it's decent. We are here, finally, we are here. It has felt like an eternity before our ocean holiday eventually started.<br /><br /> When my husband and myself got married, we procured some holiday points. It helps a lot as all the places to go to on holiday is sooo expensive.<br /><br /> So, since then we have had a tradition to save up our points for 3 years and then go on one nice long holiday. And here we are again. The ocean is calling, beckoning us to its shores with 3 kids in tow now.<br /><br /> Before our trip, we made a turn at our doctor to ensure the area where we were going was safe. We asked about injections for malaria and other viruses that may be present in the area. Once everything was medically done and safe we were on our way.<br /><br />Renting a car, first things first. <br /><br /> After getting our luggage we all followed Papa bear to the car rental service at the airport. While walking, the kids are having an argument about what color the car should be. Child no 1 wants a Pink car, really, can’t see that one happening, no 2 wants a blue car and no 3, well, she’s just looking at them as if a ball is being passed.<br /><br /> Papa bear winks at me when we get to the front desk of the rental car company, then he puts on an extremely serious face as he continues to ask – “Hi, there, please sir, my daughter wants a pink car, any in stock?”<br /><br /> I feel a giggle rising up at the pit of my stomach but manage to keep a straight face. No 1 is looking with so much expectation at the rental guy that I’m sure his squirming under the intensity of her stare.<br /><br /> To Mr rentals credit, he smiles and very seriously replies – “I am so sorry sir, the last pink chariot has left the building prior to your arrival.” No 1’s face drops with disappointment. Papa bear turns and says “So sorry honey bun, no pink ones. Maybe next time.”<br /><br /> “So, what do you have in blue?” Mr rental guy smiles and starts to tell us all our options. We ended up deciding between 3.<br /><br /> Chrysler town got an immediate no from papa bear. I knew why he’s itching to test drive either the Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape. So, when the Rental guy did not mention either of those in blue, I knew it was coming.<br /><br /> “Do you have either Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape?”<br /><br /> I could see the pent-up excitement on his face. When Mr. Rental guy confirmed that they do in fact have a 2016 Ford Escape in red, I could see papa bear jumping up and down on the inside.<br /><br /> “So kids, what about a red car?” They were easily persuaded and Papa bear was ecstatic. I did not dare touch him due to fear of being shocked. Seriously, if I looked closer, I was sure I could see tiny static running all over his being.<br /><br />Here we go<br /><br /> The bonus of flying is that there is not so much luggage. Thus, the luggage fitted in the Escape without any difficulty.<br /><br /> The nice thing about renting a car is that you get to properly test drive a car, in our case for two weeks. Papa bear was like a little boy as he was cruising down the highway. He was explaining to me about the 1.6L engine that delivers 178hp at 5700rpm. Additionally, the base model is front wheel drive and the one we are currently driving is an all-wheel-drive model. It also features a 15.5-gallon gas tank and delivers a fuel consumption of 22/29mpg.<br /><br /> He was carrying on like a dedicated car salesman. I smiled and made an hmm sound while I smiled and nodded at all the appropriate spaces. I knew this big boy was just like a little boy with a new toy. As they say right, boys and their toys…<br /><br />Meeting the local seagulls<br /><br /> We went to a nice little roadhouse next to the beach for some lunch. We got our order and parked the Escape so that we were overlooking the ocean. We sat outside on the rocks. Such a nice view as the waves broke and the wind gently sprayed us with ocean mist.<br /><br /> No 2 was holding a fry out of the window as he stared across the ocean when suddenly something grabbed the fry out of his hand. He screamed like a little girl! <br /><br /> A seagull took advantage of the hypnotic effect of the ocean and before we knew it we were surrounded by fry-stealing seagulls coming from who knows where.<br /><br /> Suddenly, we knew what it felt like to be surrounded.<br /><br /> The kids freely gave up the last of their fries in fear of seagull stares going mafia on us or being bitten. This, we took as our queue to get moving again.<br /><br />The Escape<br /><br /> The rest of our trip ran smoothly even though we had two nights of extreme mozzy (miskito, the insect kind) attacks, we knew all was fine. Everyone had their injections and no viruses were going to make us ill.<br /><br /> We enjoyed BBQ’s in the sunset overlooking the ocean and playing in the sand. We even got the opportunity to see some crabs and dolphins.<br /><br /> The thing I loved about the Escape, the SUV, is the large back seat, the kids had a ball, with plenty of space for themselves. The front seemed a bit smaller than with other SUV’s I’ve seen but the backseat and the luggage space makes up for it.<br /><br /> Some other small things that also made me like the Escape was the cruise control, backup camera and illuminating vanity mirrors. But the best is the overhead storage compartment, I could really get used to those. I can start to see why Papa Bear had his eye on the Escape. I just wonder does it come in pink?<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br /> The trip was amazing, we loved the Ford Escape and the escape from our busy lives’. The calming effect of the oceans draw refreshed us and we gained new strength to face our lives back home again. We were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br /><br /> How awesome was the fact that we need not drive all those miles back home. We got on an airplane with the refreshing effects of a 2-week ocean holiday still lingering all around us even as we got back home. On top of it all, we were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br />Article last time updated on 12.10.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-10-01 00:00:00	244	m2m
78	42	2	Everything You Should Know About a YAG Capsulotomy Procedure	Yttrium Aluminum Garnet also called YAG, is a procedure that produces infra-red laser light impulses. It is used to create small openings within tissue that are targeted through a process known as photo-disruption. Generally, it’s used for treating the iris and secondary cataracts. Sometimes doctors might also use it in treating problems with the retina at the eye’s back.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Indications<br /><br /> There is a variety of eye conditions treatable with this procedure. Conditions of the eyes that can be treated with a YAG capsulotomy procedure may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    If there are vision interferences with activities during the day.<br /><br /> •    When vision in patients decreases that have multifocal intraocular lenses that might specifically be sensitive to even tiny changes of the posterior capsular.<br /><br /> •    Increased glaring.<br /><br /> •    Difficulty to visualize the fundus.<br /><br /> •    With Z syndrome and lens tilting that is related to hinge compliant lenses, like the Trulign toric and Crystalens lenses. Z syndrome may occur if one hap tic arched posterior and the other anterior, and lens tilting can occur if one hap tic is arched either posterior or anterior and the other is planar.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In some cases, it’s possible for a tiny anterior capsular contraction, capsulorrhexis or capsular phimosis may occur. With such excessive anterior scarring to your intra-ocular lens, it might compromise your vision. Alleviation by anterior radial capsulotomies will be achieved through YAG laser treatment.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> About the procedure<br /><br /> To remove the haze capsule is a minor procedure that only requires dilation of your eye.<br /><br /> The doctor will numb your eye’s front by using special eye drops, after which he/she places a tiny contact lens on the eye. Then your head needs to rest on the YAG laser machine’s frame so that your doctor can focus the laser onto the capsule.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Small holes will be made by this laser into the capsule, in such a pattern which allows the doctor to determine what can be the best treatment for your specific condition.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Because there isn’t any incision required, you won’t feel pain or be at risk to develop infections. However, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drops for your eyes after the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Benefits of YAG capsulotomy procedures<br /><br /> •    The treatment is basically pain-free.<br /><br /> •    There isn’t any risk to get an infection.<br /><br /> •    It’s an outpatient treatment procedure.<br /><br /> •    Less healing time and trauma for your eye.<br /><br /> •    The procedure only lasts for a few minutes, though you might have to stay between one and two hours.<br /><br /> •    Reduced cost.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Recovery after the procedure<br /><br /> After the procedure, you can immediately resume normal activities and expect improvement of your vision within one day. Yet, you might experience some degree of floaters for a couple of weeks following the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> At the completion of the procedure, it’s important after a week to go back for a follow-up so that your doctor can examine the overall results, vision, and pressure. You should only as a precaution each day after your procedure tests your eye sight. Do this by closing your eye which hasn't had the surgery, and checks your eye’s vision.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Every year following the treatment you need to go for a checkup of your eyes. This is done to check for any other problems, as well as glaucoma because if your eye is just slightly unusual, examinations are critical.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Any possible risks to a YAG Capsulotomy procedure<br /><br /> Serious problems are very rare in a posterior YAG capsulotomy because it’s an extremely effective and safe procedure. However, the same as with any type of medical procedure, there might be some degree of risks involved.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The one that is very common may be the pressure that rises within your eye. When this happens the doctor can prescribe some eye drops, or maybe some combination of drops and tablets for reducing this pressure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A risk that might be a bit higher can be the detachment of your retina, as well as swelling of your macula. Nonetheless, both of these risks are quite rare, if your original surgery for cataracts with laser treatment was performed over six months earlier.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> By consulting an experienced professional eye specialist for this procedure, it may minimize your risks significantly involving posterior YAG capsulotomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Once your doctor and you decided that a posterior YAG capsulotomy will be the right choice for you, the doctor can provide you with extra information to allow you in making an informed decision of whether you want to proceed. Make sure that all questions you may have are answered to your full satisfaction.<br />Article last time updated on 24.08.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-08-24 00:00:00	365	m2m
79	42	2	Hysterectomy Types and Complications	What is a Hysterectomy and why is it performed?<br /><br /><br /><br /> A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that consists of removing the uterus. The uterus of a woman may cause pain due to a medical issue. In this case, a doctor or gynecologist can examine the uterus and run some tests to see what the issue is. If it cannot be cured, the uterus may be removed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The most common reasons a woman needs to undergo a hysterectomy procedure are as follow:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Uterine fibroids,<br /><br /> •    Endometriosis,<br /><br /> •    Adenomyosis,<br /><br /> •    Abnormal vaginal bleeding,<br /><br /> •    Chronic pelvic pain,<br /><br /> •    Pelvic inflammatory disease,<br /><br /> •    Cervical dysplasia,<br /><br /> •    Cervical cancer,<br /><br /> •    Uterine cancer,<br /><br /> •    Ovarian cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy types<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Today, there are different surgical techniques used for performing a hysterectomy when needed, such as:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Vaginal hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed through the vagina. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of endometrial hyperplasia, cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Total abdominal hysterectomy – is the most common type of hysterectomy performed among women worldwide. This surgical procedure consists of a total removal of the uterus including the cervix. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of ovary cancer, uterine cancer, large uterine fibroids, endometriosis, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Supracervical hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed but the cervix is spared. A supracervical hysterectomy is recommended in cases when there is no medical indication for removing the cervix. However, later in life, there is always the possibility of cancer development in this part of the cervix that has not been surgically removed at the same time as the uterus.  This type of hysterectomy decreases the risk of vaginal prolapse as it provides some kind of support for the vagina.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopy – assisted vaginal hysterectomy – is a similar surgical procedure to the vaginal hysterectomy, but includes the use of a laparoscope. During this procedure, the upper part of the abdomen is carefully inspected when needed. Such as in cases when the removal of the ovaries is planned as well, or in cases of early stages of endometrial cancer.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy – is similar to laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Though, the difference between these two surgical procedures consists of the fact that in laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy the uterus is separated from the cervix and later removed through a laparoscopic incision. The cervix is preserved in this type of surgery. Thus, the recovery period is faster.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Radical hysterectomy – is an extensive type of surgery usually performed in cases where early stages of cervical cancer are noted. This surgical procedure consists of not only removing the uterus and the cervix but also removing the upper part of the vagina and the surrounding tissues as well. There is a great possibility of a urinary system injury, as well as a bowel injury.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Oophorectomy and scalping - oophorectomy is a surgical procedure which consists of the removal of the ovaries in cases of oophorectomy. In the case of scalping - oophorectomy the adjacent Fallopian tubes are removed as well. These two surgical procedures combined with hysterectomy are performed in cases of ovarian cancer, Fallopian tube cancer, uterine cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy Complications<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Just like any surgical procedure, a hysterectomy has its own risks and possible complications. However, in most of the cases, women do not have any complications at all after this surgical procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> According to different studies, vaginal hysterectomies are linked with fewer risks and complications when compared to abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomies. The more radical the surgical procedure is the greater is the possibility of various risks and complications following hysterectomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Also, the recovery period is shorter in cases of vaginal hysterectomy, when compared to laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomies. Hysterectomy risks and complications greatly depend upon the type of hysterectomy procedure performed, as well as, the overall health of the women undergoing the surgery.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Common risks and complications following a hysterectomy regarding of its type include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Blood clots,<br /><br /> •    Heavy blood loss,<br /><br /> •    Bladder injury,<br /><br /> •    Bowel injury,<br /><br /> •    Infection,<br /><br /> •    Adhesions in the pelvic area,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Weakness of the pelvic muscles and ligaments which normally support the vagina, rectum and the bladder,<br /><br /> •    Difficulties urinating,<br /><br /> •    Early menopause,<br /><br /> •    Anesthesia problems, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Recovering after hysterectomy<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Even though a hysterectomy is a safe surgical procedure, it is often associated with various risks and complications. In general, hospitalization for a couple of days and sometimes weeks following the surgery is required. It only depends on the overall health of the patient and the reason why this procedure is performed in the first place. The recovery period will also depend on the type of hysterectomy performed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In cases of vaginal hysterectomy, the recovery period is faster compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, and even longer for an abdominal hysterectomy. After a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, women should be able to return to their normal daily routines within three to four weeks. In cases of abdominal hysterectomy, the recovery period will take a little bit longer, about four to six weeks.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> However, for a certain period of time after the surgery lifting heavy things, pushing or pulling objects, bending and even sexual intercourse should be avoided.<br />Article last time updated on 23.08.2017.

81	44	2	What You Need to Know about Hormone Testing: Which Test to Use When?	The healthcare space has been abuzz with debates about hormonal imbalance and the best methods to monitor hormones. The majority of healthcare professionals encourage patients to monitor their hormone levels at home using hormone testing. In fact, the National Institute of Health (NIH) has been using these kits in its clinical trials for over three decades. These kits offer accurate results, are easy-to-use and affordable too. They save you multiple trips to the laboratory and offer the flexibility to collect multiple samples within a 24-hour period.<br />  <br /> Three body fluids are used to measure hormone levels: blood, urine, and saliva. Each of them has certain advantages and limitations, and each serves a distinct purpose. Therefore, they should be used based on their usefulness rather than mere convenience for the patient or the doctor. This post shares information on a variety of hormone testing methods and evaluates which one is to be used when.<br />  1. Serum/Blood Test: A blood test is a time-tested technique for monitoring hormones. It is preferred because it requires minimal patient involvement and correlates accurately with the symptoms. Serum tests are ideal for testing hormones like follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, fasting insulin, and thyroid hormones.<br />  <br /> Although routine serum tests are a preferred method for monitoring hormone levels, they have their limits.  Blood tests are unable to distinguish between protein-bound hormones (inactive) and the biologically active forms. It only gives a rough estimate of the hormone levels. Thus, blood tests are not preferred for testing adrenal hormones like cortisol. Moreover, a serum hormone test is a snapshot of your hormone levels at a single point in time, which may not be enough to diagnose a problem. Finally, a serum test does not typically allow the accurate measurement of several hormone metabolites. Metabolites offer deep insights on the pathology of the existing disease.<br />  <br /> A serum test, like other methods, has its merits and limitations. However, the fact remains that this is the most conventional method with well-established reference ranges. Also, it is easy, inexpensive, and easily accessible.<br />  2. Urine Test: In addition to being non-invasive, a 24-hour urine test is accurate in assessing physiological hormone levels. A urine test is best suited for monitoring female hormones, androgens, factors for breast and prostate cancers, adrenal hormones, and in cases of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. An additional advantage of a urine test is that it can monitor the parent hormone and its excreted metabolites. For example, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is one of the primary metabolites of testosterone and its elevated level is the primary indicator for prostate cancer. Thus, while high levels of testosterone are desirable, the same isn’t true for DHT.<br />  <br /> One issue with urine test is that the sample collection can be quite messy. It involves carrying around a container meant for storing the urine specimen. Moreover, the results are not completely fool-proof as it measures only the excreted metabolites. An analogy to this will be measuring the food a person consumes by looking at his trash can. Having said that, the metabolites excreted in the urine are useful markers for numerous diseases and hormonal irregularities. This is why urine tests are extremely valuable to the hormone-testing domain.<br />  3. Saliva Test: A saliva test is beneficial to monitor the levels of cortisol according to the circadian rhythm – the body’s internal clock. Several hormones are released, used and reabsorbed by the body as per the cycle. Cortisol levels change during the day and hence, a 24-hour urine evaluation doesn’t help the healthcare expert. On the other hand, saliva cortisol testing conducted four times a day provides an accurate pattern of cortisol. Similarly, this test is also useful to monitor the cyclical output of hormones throughout the month in menstruating and menopausal women.<br />  <br /> Like other methods, saliva tests too have their constraints. The results may take time to show in elderly patients, who might have limited salivary output. In patients undergoing exogenous hormone replacement therapy, the results can be unreliable. A saliva test is not ideal for women consuming sublingual hormones in the form of drops, sprays or lozenges. These delivery methods concentrate the hormones in the saliva, thus showing abnormally high readings. In cases other than this, a saliva test helps measure the hormones that are actually available in the blood stream at a cellular level. This means that the readings are accurate and correlate better with the symptoms.<br />  4. Combination Test: In more complex situations, multiple tests may be necessary. In such challenging cases, combining two or more methods offers a better insight. For example, a combination test (saliva and blood test) may help in case of a perimenopausal patient struggling to find the right dose of hormone.<br />  <br /> Achieving hormonal balance is critical to maintaining optimal health in both, men and women. Unfortunately, the symptoms of hormonal imbalance can go unnoticed and hence, hormone testing kits are preferred for their accuracy and convenience of use. It is important to consider the pros and cons of each method before narrowing down to one. The above information will help you choose the right method for monitoring your hormones at home, depending on your diagnostic needs.(Photo Credit: Pixabay)<br />Article last time updated on 21.06.2017.

82	44	2	5 Tips to Move Closer to a Healthy and Strong Heart	Problems related to the heart are among the leading causes of death in people. In fact, it is the number one cause of mortality in human beings.<br /><br /> Cardiovascular health is influenced by a number of factors, primarily your diet and lifestyle habits. Your age and genetic tendencies also influence the well-being of your heart.<br /><br /> Since heart health is on everybody's mind, it is also present in all media feeds. You are bombarded with a list of dos and don'ts, and have probably reached the conclusion that there is only so much you can do and it is best to leave the rest to your good luck. But, that need not necessarily be so.<br /><br /> Here are a few things that you can do to maintain a happy, healthy and strong heart.<br /><br />1) Start Early<br /><br /> The key is to start working towards better heart health as soon as possible. Deposition of fats in the arterial walls starts in childhood itself. Fat, however, does not put on the killer avatar when you hit your 30's or 40's. You need to limit unhealthy fats in the diet of kids to ensure that they are set on the path of cardiovascular well-being.<br /><br /> So whether you are a healthy 25-year old or in your late 30s, remember to be mindful of what you eat. A low-carb diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables is just what the doctor has ordered for you.<br /><br />2) Beat Stress<br /><br /> No one knows stress better than a doctor him/herself. Erratic working hours, tight schedules, work overload, unpredictable nature of work, and emotional strain are all too common in the profession. It is important to prevent job stress from wreaking havoc on your heart health.<br /><br /> Meditation and yoga are scientifically proven to help in maintaining and improving well-being of the heart. Yoga calms your mind, stretches and activates muscles, relaxes the nervous system and mitigates stress.<br /><br /> In addition to yoga, you can do several other things to enable your mind and body to beat stress. Do not bring work home, learn detachment, follow passions, spend time with family, and remember to enjoy vacations. Making small changes to your busy lifestyle will help you fight stress and keep it away.<br /><br />3) Do Not Miss out on Sleep<br /><br /> An over-worked and tired heart is also one that is vulnerable to illnesses and diseases. Your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body and does so at least 60-100 times every minute. Combine this with the daily stresses and strains of life, and it becomes clear that this vital organ of our body needs rest as well.<br /><br /> Unlike other muscles in our body, heart muscles technically do not need rest and remain perfectly healthy as long as there is no obstruction in oxygen supply. But, continuous stress can lead to heart fatigue and scarring of muscles.<br /><br /> Ensure that you get enough sleep every day. This will help stabilize and normalize other body functions that have an impact on heart health. Studies show that the lack of sleep in adolescents puts them at a greater risk of developing heart diseases in adulthood.  Higher cholesterol levels, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure levels, and increased risk of hypertension were reported.<br /><br />4) Walk, Walk, Walk<br /><br /> Walking is one of the easiest things to do to march your way to good health. It is a mild form of aerobic exercise that increases the heart rate, strengthens muscles, improves oxygen supply, increases blood circulation, and exercises the heart.<br /><br /> Also, a home health care screening & testing aid will monitor heart health results and show that walking helps lower LDL (bad) cholesterol level and improves HDL (good) cholesterol level in the body. Walking briskly for 30 minutes every day is all that is required to maintain heart health. A Harvard study conducted on male health professionals showed that walking at least half an hour three times a week reduced risk of coronary artery disease by 18%. Regular monitoring will make the benefits amply clear to you.<br /><br /> Also, walking does not work on an 'all or nothing' maxim. You can start step by step, and slowly inculcate the walking habit in your lifestyle.<br /><br />5) Take Care of Your Teeth<br /><br /> Dental health also influences cardiovascular health. Studies have found similarities in bacteria found in dental plaque and in atherosclerotic plaque. Though a direct and causative link between periodontal disease and heart disease has not been proved, the incidence of heart disease in people with periodontitis (gum disease) is much higher than in people with no gum disease.<br /><br /> The type of bacteria responsible for gum disease releases toxins that cause inflammation of blood vessels. They are also believed to cause the same inflammatory response in all vessels, including the arterial blood vessels. This increases the risk of clot formation in arteries.<br /><br /> So, manage and maintain the health of your pearly whites. Regular brushing and flossing not only gives you a beautiful smile, but may give you a healthy heart as well.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br /> A healthy heart is testimony to your overall physical and mental well-being. Ensure you eat right, exercise regularly, stay stress-free and happy, and develop safe and healthy life habits as early in life as possible. This will protect you from cardiovascular problems and other invasive complications later on in life.<br /> (Image Source)<br />Article last time updated on 29.05.2017.

83	45	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet.

84	47	2	Women and Heart Disease	More than 400,000 American women die each year from CVDs, at a rate that is close to one death per minute. 2,3 Adding to the poor prognosis is the finding that nearly two-thirds of women with fatal outcomes never experienced any warning symptoms.3 The situation with CVDs in younger women also warrants attention.  The mortality from coronary heart disease among women age 35 to 44 years showed an average annual increase of 1.3% between 1997 and 2002.4 The projected increase in coronary heart disease deaths in 2020, compared to 2006, is 9% for women age 35-44 and 15.9% for women age 45-54.5<br /> A complicating factor in developing a tailored treatment approach for women lies in the fact that they have been largely underrepresented in clinical trials. In addition, approximately three-fourths of clinical trials conducted in CVD subjects do not report gender-specific results.6 Researchers are now making an effort to close this information gap by including female subjects and comparing CVD outcomes between the two genders.<br /> A recent study examined the association between multiple cardiac risk factors and the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease in men and women.7 The study found that women with diabetes, hypertension, and smoking had significantly greater odds ratios for obstructive coronary artery disease than men with identical risk factors. The differences between genders were even more pronounced in patients with multiple risk factors. Women with four cardiac risk factors had almost double the risk for obstructive coronary artery disease compared with men.<br /> Another relevant study reviewed 64 cohort studies published between January 1st, 1966 and February 13th, 2013 in Medline and focused on identifying any sex differences in the effect of diabetes on the risk of CVD. 8 The study reported that diabetes increases the risk of incident coronary heart disease in women by more than 40% compared with men with diabetes. The reason behind such a difference in diabetes-related risk of coronary heart diseases in men and women is poorly understood. Higher levels of CVD risk factors and relative undertreatment in women do not account for all of the excess risk observed. Elucidating the causes behind gender differences in risk factors would have important implications in management and treatment of CVD in women.<br /> It is an unfortunate fact that the increasing body of knowledge available on heart disease, associated risk factors and prevention measures often goes underutilized. The American Heart Association is working on raising awareness through education and advocacy.2 The FDA has joined in these efforts by identifying four important guidelines for women: eating a heart healthy diet, managing existing health conditions, learning the facts about aspirin, and recognizing the signs of a heart attack. NIH’s The Heart Truth program sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute aims ‘’to raise awareness about heart disease and its risk factors among women and educate and motivate them to take action to prevent the disease and control its risk factors.’’<br /> Through targeted research, education, and close communication between the healthcare providers and patients, CVD outcomes in women will likely improve. Heart disease rarely develops in the absence of the major risk factors, such as: elevated levels of blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. February is American Heart Month – a perfect time to re-evaluate your own risks for CVD and prompt the women in your life to be proactive about their health. It is time to speak loudly about the silent killer.References<br /> 1. Women’s health. WHO Fact sheet no. 334. September 2013. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2011.<br /><br /> 2.

85	48	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

86	48	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

87	48	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

Of course, the upholders of the Ukrainian government would say that mine has been planted by ""terrorists."" Another concerned person of this incident is the older brother of the girl - he also got injured by the land mine.<br /><br /> Their mother came to me for a doctor's note for her 14-year-old daughter who took care of her 5-year-old sister in the hospital. The mother had to take care of her one-month-old baby and therefore she could take care of her other daughter in the surgical department.<br /><br /> The Children's Hospital has the most necessary medicine. In pharmacies they have a few drugs that got a lot more expensive. The government of DPR (Donetsk People Republic) began with payments, but these payments do not correspond to the higher prices. However, it is better than no payments from the Ukraine (Ukrainian government stopped all kinds of payments – pension, benefits, salaries in August 2014. How did people survive? Only they know…).<br /><br /> Prices for everything - medicines, food and other goods also got more expensive due to the ongoing Ukrainian blockade of Donetsk. Some supermarket chains closed because of this blockade.<br /><br /> On the photo above this blog entry you can see a house which I pass on my way to work. It is damaged by shelling, some windows are smashed, some windows are sealed with adhesive tape - it saves you from broken glass and people say it even helps to preserve the glass (my windows are also sealed - but with transparent tape).

89	49	2	About the importance of measles vaccination	"A personal acquaintance that had measles completely convinced me of the need for vaccination.<br /><br /> I have a very personal relationship with this infection:<br /> When I was a child measles vaccine was administered at the age of 1 year and 16 years.<br /><br /> I got the vaccination aged 1 year... But the group of silly 16-year-old schoolgirls was scared of injections and refused vaccination.<br /><br /> When my son was 1 year he got his measles vaccine. I was 24, I was a medical intern and we conducted all vaccinations. Exactly a month after his vaccinations I became ill with measles. It was as follows: I was in the theater, listening to ""La Traviata"" and after the spectacle I barely could get home because I was feeling so bad.<br /> The last thing I remember that this night I was trying to take aspirin and dropped the kettle because my hands were shaking. The next 10 days, I do not remember anything.<br /><br /> They said that I was woken up by a fever. I received an injection antipyretic and 15 minutes later I went back to sleep for 2-3 hours until the next temperature rise. Skin rash appeared on me and I had all the symptoms:  Small, flat blotches that blended into one another. My cheeks and forehead were reddened first. Then the rash spread down the arms and trunk, then over the thighs and legs. The rash disappeared in the same order, but pigment spots still remained for a long time - at least a month.<br /><br /> Fortunately, I have not had measles encephalitis. But I did have measles pneumonia. I caught measles from a neighbor who lived on the floor above. My son didn’t fall sick with measles.<br /><br /> Of course, in addition to the rash and fever I had all other measles symptoms – dry cough (very painful), runny nose, sore throat and conjunctivitis. But I do not know if I had Koplik spots - tiny white papules that are on the inner lining of the cheek in the first 1-2 days of the illness.<br /><br /> Commonly, the measles virus incubates without signs for the first 10 to 14 days after a person is infected. Often measles begin like a normal cold and only after 2-3 days the typical rash appears on the skin. Koplik spots often stay unnoticed.<br /><br /> A person with measles spreads the virus for about 8 days – approximately 4 days before the rash appears and 4 days after. Complications of measles may include the following: ear infection, bronchitis, laryngitis, croup, pneumonia, encephalitis, pregnancy problems - pregnancy loss, preterm labor or low birth weight, and thrombocytopenia.<br /><br /> The main risk factor of measles is for unvaccinated persons, especially young children. The measles virus is highly contagious spread by coughing and sneezing.<br /><br /> In order to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks WHO recommends administrating 2 doses of vaccine.<br /><br /> Immunization against measles for one child costs about US $1.Unfortunately, we have no vaccines since July. The war...<br /><br /> Measles - one of the diseases in which the group’s immunity is particularly important. The presence of a pool of vaccinated immune people prevents the spread of the virus.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Maria Bobrova/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 21.04.2015."

90	49	2	Life as a doctor in a shelled area in Ukraine	"It is very, very scary, when you hear the shot and then the packet’s whistle and then – explosion. If an explosion is far - 500 meters is far – you can hear just sharp sounds and you can continue doing your thing. If your windows shakes – you should go to the hallway.<br /><br /> If the whole house shakes – you must run to the hallway, lie on the floor and wish that the next packet will not come to you.<br /><br /> Every day. Every night. At every moment the shell can fly to your home and destroyed it, kill you or your family.<br /><br /> After such a night you go to work. A shell can fly on the bus or to the bus stop. Your husband wishes you won't go to work but you get salary albeit 2 months delayed. Your family needs this money - it is the only income. Ukrainian government refused to pay pensions to people who had been working in Ukraine all their lives.<br /><br /> Ukrainian checkpoints do not miss to control the city trucks with food and medications. Insulin, antibiotics, antipyretics, antihypertensive, anticonvulsants became scarce and very expensive.<br /><br /> After the doctor’s appointments I go on home visits. The air is abuzz with gunfire and explosions. I walk past five-storey buildings in which glass is about to fall out. Scary.<br /><br /> One day, the bus came directly under firing. Between the two explosions I could leap out and fall under the garage wall. Before the next explosion, I managed to go down into the cellar of the nearby house. I stood there, pressed against the wall and could only think of the fact that the shells explode close to where my home is. And that my husband and son were there. As soon as the shelling ended I ran home. We took all our animals (our doggy, two zebra finches, budgie, three chinchillas (one was only a few days) and moved into my mother's place to a more quiet area. More quiet area means that the buildings are not shaking from the explosions there.<br /><br /> We waited for the announced February 15 truce. These two weeks especially the last days before the February 15 were very scary. The city was trembling from explosions. The factory where my son works as veterinary doctor (in the factory zoo) was shelled. My son has outlasted shelling in the cellar and then bandaged the wounded at the entrance of the factory. At the same time, in the morning,  a bus station was shelled, two drivers and several passengers were killed.<br /><br /> Finally, we have lived to silence. Sometimes the shellings begin again but they are weaker.<br /><br /> Products are very grew and they became less. Medications are still scarce. Ukraine blocks Donetsk and we often remember the blockade of Leningrad. Ukrainians tell us that we deserved shelling and blockade because we voted at a referendum and expressed our opinion. All this is happening in the 21st century, in a country that calls itself democratic and whose leaders claim that they are Europeans.<br /><br /> According to the UN about 5,000 civilians were killed during the war in the Donbass. In fact, that number is 10 times more.<br /><br />The President of Ukraine said about the inhabitants of Donetsk: ""Their children will sit in cellars."" The Ukrainian government is trying to implement a program of their President.<br /><br /> Earth, Europe, Ukraine, Donbass, 21st Century.<br />Article last time updated on 09.03.2015."	Dr. med.

91	49	2	Unusual rash	It was a very unusual rash. There were small (up to 5 mm long) blisters at the edges of both palms and soles of my little patient. It could not be chicken pox since the patient had that a year ago.<br /> Maybe it was an allergic reaction, but to what allergen? What changed in the girl's environment or diet?<br /> The mother mentioned that new sand was brought to the kindergarten's sandboxes the day before they consulted me. However, I asked myself why her daughter’s throat was red while doing a home visit and examining the girl (in our medical culture, home visits are standard for routine complaints).<br /> The mother's main concern was if it was okay to send the girl back to kindergarten tomorrow.<br /> I actually didn’t know. Two days before there was nothing on her skin, then wheals appeared and turned into blisters the next day. She already had chickenpox. Her throat was red. She had no fever, her temperature was normal. The rash did not itch.<br /> I told the mother I didn’t know what it was.  I told her: “Let me examine her again tomorrow and also get CBC tomorrow morning please, so I can see the results in the afternoon.”<br /> CBC was compatible with a viral infection. There were no cells pathognomic for an acutely allergic state.<br /> Then, during the re-exam, I saw new sore spots in her mouth.<br /> A few days later, a 3-year-old boy who lives nearby, developed similar symptoms.<br /> It turned out there were more than 50 of such cases that autumn.<br /> I think that it was the hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which is a mild viral exanthem. It is usually young children that are affected. It is considered to be caused by a coxsackievirus.<br /> This virus spreads orally by airborne contamination, by contact with nasal secretions, saliva, weeping blisters, droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or a sneeze, or by stool particles because young children often put their fingers in their mouth. Sometimes, adults are infected without symptoms and pass the virus to others.<br /> There is no specific treatment for hand-foot-and-mouth disease since it is self-limited.

92	49	2	One of my working days	"Some patient voices:<br /><br />Patient: ""May I come in?""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Welcome, come in, what happened to you?""<br /><br />Patient: ""I want you to put my child on record. We moved here.""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Okay. Let's get his medical records. Where are you from?""<br /><br />Patient: ""Kremlin Avenue.  (Settlement October mine*).""<br /><br /><br /> Patients come from everywhere: Petrovka*, Spartac*, Putilovka*, again Putilovka*, Gornyak (Miner)*, Azotniy*, Putilovka*, Petrovka*, Krasnogorovka*, Avdeevka*.<br /> In the early summer many people were from Mar’inka* - and they all remained here, in my district.<br /> Their voices are ringing from tears:<br /><br />  ""Our house is intact yet, my mother’s house down the street was demolished.""<br /><br />  ""Blown.""<br /><br />  ""Today I went after things - again, barely managed to escape.""<br /><br />  ""When a house next door blew off the roof, I decided to leave.""<br /><br />  ""Our house burned down. (Mother and her five-year-old daughter are laughing). The main thing is that we are safe and rescued the cat."" (A clever mother, well done. Her daughter hasn’t got post-traumatic neurosis)<br /><br />  ""We were shelled every day, I cannot stand it any longer.<br /><br />  <br /><br />""I'm afraid even to send him (the son) to school.""<br /><br />  ""Don't be afraid, it's quiet here. Not a single shell splinter fell.""<br /><br />""All the same, I'm afraid, I'm afraid of any noise.""<br /><br />  <br /><br />  Patient: ""We do not have the medical records, will you take us?""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Don't worry, I'll take you. We’ll make new records, get the paperwork to the school and kindergarten. Everything will be solved.""<br /><br />  <br /><br />  Other patient: ""We have moved, will you take us?""<br /><br /> I don't send them to the chief, as I should. I just type them in the census, take the records if they have one and make new records for those who haven't.<br /> In my opinion, they are already more than those who left early in the summer.<br /> Today: another shelling. Nothing special. This is a routine district doctor’s work in a city which is shelled on a daily basis.<br /> The area where my doctor's district is located is one of the few without shelling. I go to work with the sounds of cannon fire. The Government of Ukraine said that they won't pay our salaries. This means 150€ per month and less for me.<br /> Maybe, I should explain you something regarding the features of ukranian medical care.<br /> Our government started the reform of medical care. Most therapists and pediatricians were retrained to family physicians. But most of us are trying to work in their specialty – and our bosses are trying to help us in this (if they are smart bosses), because it is very difficult to change the speciality after 23 years of work.<br /> District pediatrician should observe at least 800 children. Family doctors – 1,400 adults and children. We had enough doctors before but some doctors left the city because of the war, so I am working on three districts - for three doctors. I should observe, do routine exams (monthly children under one year and annually up to 18 years), vaccinate, diagnose and treat 2,400 children (in fact they are a little less - about 2,000). And I have to go to the call and patronage (four times in first month of life, twice – doctor and twice - nurse) to their home.<br /> And of course I should write a lot of records and reports - at least 5 per examination of the patient and 5 monthly.<br /> * - names of villages, towns and urban areas, which are shelled on a daily basis.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2014."

93	49	2	Low-grade fever as beginning of duodenal ulcer	Her mother has been taking her to many doctors. The girl was seen by an endocrinologist, an otolaryngologist, a neurologist- in short, by all possible medical specialties whom the mother found, who had remained in the city under siege at that time (most of the physicians fled the bombings). Why so many specialists? Because our patients are accustomed to running for a specialist. They apparently think that any generalist – a pediatrician, an internist, a family physician – is like a low-level medical manager, a gate-keeper, that he or she is good for requesting tests and consults, especially where free medicine is concerned - if invalids, pensioners and their relatives will request it and persist.<br /><br /> But let us get back to my patient.<br /><br /> She had endured a lot of testing – all results were nonrevealing, normal. The specialists, one and all, zoomed in on the most “fashionable” diagnosis of exclusion - autonomic dysfunction. However, each of the physicians prescribed some medication or other just in case – iodine, sedatives, vitamins, supplements, immunostimulants and homeopathy. The girl’s mother bought them all and gave them to the child - whose condition did not improve.<br /><br /> After a long interview I found out that the girl is experiencing nausea every morning. She also complained of stomach ache – without any connection to food intake.<br /><br /> Pain in epigastric and paraumbilical regions was elicited on palpation.<br /><br /> I offered the treatment of gastritis without H.pylori therapy, and gastric imaging by endoscopy - however, the family refused the latter.<br /><br /> The girl did well with treatment, however her symptoms were still occasionally recurring.<br /><br /> In a couple of weeks, I persuaded them to do FGDS. It was indeed a duodenal bulb ulcer. This time I prescribed eradication.<br /><br /> The girl is doing well, but continues to have occasional low-grade fevers. What is it? The ulcer not entirely healed? An infection? Thermoneurosis, an enteric dysregulation?<br /><br /> I cannot evaluate this, because the only children's hospital with relevant clinic capabilities was damaged during the shelling, and cannot be used.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />hemeroskopion/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 06.11.2014.

94	49	2	Routine district doctor's work in a shelled city	"The child's  mother tried to find a pediatrician, but  she said, “There is a lock on the clinic door, and there is no one”, in a war-riddled town.  So she gave the girl  an antipyretic, and blamed teething for the fevers. <br /><br /> The  mother talked about this to her friend – an older and a more experienced woman - and this friend found me through Facebook.<br /><br /> I am a pediatrician and a family physician, I work in another clinic,  in a different medical district. <br /><br /> I should not have taken on this child's case,  according to the rules of our healthcare system, crossing the borders of regional providers. Yet,  we really did not have enough doctors in the area,  because of the war-related closing of most clinics. <br /><br /> The baby's general exam was within normal - she was an active, cheerful child. Her gums were pink, not swollen - so the ""teething"" hypothesis was not confirmed.  The nasopharyngeal exam was normal as well. This child had no evidence of an upper respiratory infection.  I have ordered urine and blood screening tests.<br /><br /> The mother returned from the laboratory discouraged:  the technicians told her that they did not have the chemicals needed to do the panel I ordered, they could only do ""the minimal three"" - the leukocyte count, hemoglobin, and ESR.<br /><br /> - Whatever I can get, - I thought...<br /><br /> Hemoglobin was normal, WBC - 11 , ESR – 15, both elevated. <br /><br /> Urinalysis revealed  proteinuria, leukocyturia, multiple squamous epithelial cells.<br /><br /> “A kidney infection?” – I thought.<br /><br /> After that I hit upon the idea to ask the mother about the living conditions at her home. She told me that for the last month they had been living in a basement - it was used as a bomb shelter. They live next to the recently bombed City Youth Center, with daily shellings nearby.  In the basement it was cold and damp.<br /><br /> This connected the dots for me: despite all the efforts of the mother, the baby was in a chilly and damp area, possibly on a cold floor -  and kidney infection in infants may be asymptomatic, except for fever, in this case.<br /><br /> Appropriate treatment  was effected, and it helped -  in 10 days there was no fever, and the urinalysis normalized. <br /><br /> Nothing special. This is a routine district doctor’s work in a city which is shelled on a daily basis.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />John Kelly/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 06.10.2014."	Dr. med.

97	52	2	How Long will I Need to Wear a Brace for Better Result	Naturally, we have a lot of questions before starting a treatment programme.  And, when we go for braces, there is one of the common questions we get asked a lot: how long will I need to wear the braces?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The answer to this question is not always straight forward. It depends on the type of dental treatment and the brace you choose.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The first thing the patients need to know is that there is no definite time limitation in this treatment, because it depends completely on the condition of that individual’s teeth condition. How many teeth are to be treated, how much movement is needed, and finally the approach of the patient that how is teeth and the smile is going to look ; are the few basics which must be consulted with the dentist.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Braces: What Are the Options?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> There are four major types of braces. All these have different qualities, which are comfortable as well as affordable to the patients. <br /><br />  <br /><br />Damon Orthodontic Brace:<br />  Damon Orthodontic Braces do not require conventional elastic or metal ‘ties’, rather this includes a slide mechanism which helps the pressure of the teeth to diminish and allows to be treated more comfortably. A patient can use a clear brace or an orthodox metal for this treatment.

98	53	2	Emotional Effect on Women That Have an Abortion	In general, we find that abortion is very stressful for women. It is not easy when they decide to terminate a pregnancy. First of all, falling pregnant can already be stressful, especially if it comes with certain medical problems, when it’s unwanted, or even in rape cases.<br /><br /> Furthermore, we find that directly after a woman has had an abortion, she might experience unexpected emotions and reactions. Sometimes it’s also difficult to discuss it due to religious and cultural reasons. Many women might feel emotional distress and guilt caused by religious beliefs that normally creates a stigma concerning abortions.<br /><br /> However, most emotional and psychological responses related to an abortion is normal. Yet, it shouldn’t be severe or persistent enough to affect their daily lifestyle, it typically fades on its own.<br /><br />Some of these feelings naturally can include the following:<br /><br /> Loss of her self-esteem<br /><br /> Stress that can reduce her ability to cope<br /><br /> Regret or remorse<br /><br /> Guilt<br /><br /> Grief due to the sense of loss<br /><br /> Relief or anxiety<br /><br /> Not every woman will experience emotional responses that are negative with an abortion. Those that do shouldn’t have problems concerning their mental health that is lasting. Some might react positive and feel relief without any regrets. This is because they feel confident that their decision was a choice that is right for them. <br /><br /> About depression<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a mental or psychological condition of your health, also known as a mood disorder.<br /><br /> Some symptoms and signs you might experience when you are depressed can include:<br /><br /> Sleep patterns that are disturbed<br /><br /> Losing interest in any activities you used to enjoy<br /><br /> Lose your interest in having intercourse<br /><br /> Tiredness or lack of energy<br /><br /> Irritable feelings<br /><br /> Feeling guilty<br /><br /> Concentration that is poor, plus finds it difficult to make decisions<br /><br /> Your ability to think can be reduced<br /><br /> Experiencing sadness or feeling low<br /><br /> Depression can develop at various severity levels. Women that have a mild condition will be able to perform her activities daily with some ease. However, when depression is severe it can affect her life so dramatically that she won’t be able to work. It may also cause other mental issues that are more serious, like psychosis.<br /><br /> Feelings of self-harm or suicide are symptoms that are very serious and they will need help urgently. Depression may not be a reason for physical changes but sometimes depressed patients can talk very slowly. It might also have other effects such as loss of appetite which could cause loss of weight and even anorexia or bulimia.<br /><br /> Grief or depression due to an abortion<br /><br /> Grief is a reaction that is naturally occurring with the death of a loved one, but it shouldn’t cause depression over a long term.<br /><br /> To experience loss after termination of an unplanned pregnancy can also be natural, like due to an injury or illness. Yet, in this case, because of a spontaneous abortion, the symptoms might not last very long.<br /><br /> Most of the time, even if a woman decides on an abortion to terminate a pregnancy, she will still experience feelings that are natural of regret, guilt, grief, sadness, and loss afterward.<br /><br /> Risk factors for depression<br /><br /> Women with mental disorders prior to unwanted pregnancies who goes for an abortion can experience it differently as what healthy women would. They might be at a higher risk to develop depression after the procedure.<br /><br />These risk factors may include:<br /><br /> If they previously had childbirth that was unwanted<br /><br /> In the case of alcohol or drug use<br /><br /> A history of emotional or violence problems<br /><br /> With poverty<br /><br /> Genetics can also be linked to a very high risk of developing depression after an abortion. This means if any of their relatives also experienced depression as an illness factor, it will be more likely for a woman to experience it herself.<br /><br /> Specific events in life may trigger depressive episodes. These include such as rape or physical abuse and it can trigger depression that is severe after an abortion as it may cause a feeling of loss and separation.<br /><br /> It’s important for any woman making the choice to go for an abortion, no matter what the reason might be, to consult a professional for help before and after the procedure. Doctors have the experience to help you understand what you can expect during the abortion and afterward. and may recommend sessions with professional staff to help you through this emotional time.<br />Article last time updated on 01.01.2018.

100	53	2	Treatments Used in Dental Habit Therapy That Can Help Your Child	It’s possible for anyone to develop bad habits during their life. In some cases, young children may have bad habits that could actually influence the function and development of their mouth, teeth, and jaws. Examples of this can be thumb sucking, mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting that are persistent.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The reflex of sucking can be a natural occurrence among children at an early age, which normally disappears between the ages of two and four years. However, if the problem persists after four years, the pressure on their upper jaw and front teeth may cause teeth to start moving apart. Plus, it can result in the jaw changing its shape. This conditions might impair their speech and also cause an open bite problem.<br /><br /> With mouth breathing, which relates to a pattern of breathing that is not normal, causing their mouths to remain always open. This can pass direct air into the lungs, and cause muscular alteration functions of their face and tongue. The lower and upper jaw may abnormally grow and cause orthodontic conditions that can be serious.<br /><br /> Some issues that will need habit therapy among children<br /><br /> Two issues that are known to be the biggest problem in children concerning bad habits can include finger or thumb sucking, plus tongue thrusting. The thrusting of the tongue can occur if a child pushes his/her tongue forward onto the teeth constantly. Most of the time they will outgrow such a habit at around four years old. Although, if it doesn’t happen, it may cause their teeth to misalign.<br /><br /> Side effects from misalignment might seriously affect how a child’s face looks. It’s important that you consult a professional dentist for correcting the problems since the child at such a young age won’t understand any of the consequences.<br /><br /> Thumb sucking treatment using orthodontic appliances<br /><br /><br /><br /> When your child persistently sucks his/her thumb, consider getting orthodontic treatment early for stopping this behavior, as well as preventing problems from developing. It’s important to help the child understand what problems can be associated with this habit and suggest different ways to stop it.<br /><br /> Different ways to try and stop the habit may include reminding them about the dangers of the habit. Additionally, at night time place a hand puppet, sock or mitten over the hand. Furthermore, consider using an elbow elastic support that might make it difficult for bending his/her elbow to prevent thumb sucking. Sometimes, these habits are an emotional comfort device and scolding can only worsen the situation.<br /><br /> However, when it doesn’t help, your dentist may suggest an orthodontic appliance, known as a tongue crib which painlessly and gently will stop thumb sucking completely. This treatment can physically prevent the habit and typically, your child’s habit should be over within a couple of months if wearing this appliance.<br /><br /> Treatment appliances for tongue thrusting<br /><br /> This habit happens when your child pushes his or her tongue against the teeth in front while they are swallowing or speaking. A parent might feel it’s not a big issue, though, as time goes by the pressure that is exerted through their tongue onto the teeth may relate to orthodontic open bite problems.<br /><br /> An appliance for tongue thrusting will correct such behavior and prevent the child from thrusting his/her tongue against the teeth. Thus, it can allow the teeth to develop as it should.<br /><br /> This appliance can be placed in a comfortable and safe way to correct the child’s habit. It’s a semi-permanent attachment to the teeth very similar to the way braces are fitted. For the duration it is worn, it will guide the child to correct his/her patterns of behavior. Sometimes it might also be recommended for a child to get a speech or exercise therapy together with such a dental appliance.<br /><br /> Sometimes success can be reached after only a couple of days. All the same, the time it takes doesn’t really matter because once the orthodontist can confirm your child is over the habit, they will remove the appliance. It’s very similar to a palatal crib which may typically be used for preventing a child to suck his/her thumb, it only differs from what this crib actually blocks.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

101	53	2	What Platelet Lysate Treatments Do	Normally Platelets found in the body releases in a slow manner some growth factors to promote healing. Granting, at times the doctor might need to contain these growth factors within platelets so that it’s immediately accessible for promoting healing faster. This is used in areas that are affected by disease or damage.<br /><br /> However, in certain areas of your body where doctors use PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, it might cause a lot of inflammation. Therefore, they prefer to create a Platelet Lysate solution. This is done by cracking the Platelets open and allowing all growth factors to promptly be released into your body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a purely concentrated solution of the growth factors found in plasma once platelets were removed and activated. This regenerative solution that doctor’s use has minimal inflammatory reactions and it’s immediately very active. It’s a preferred solution to treat areas of injured nerves, new stem cells, and in your epidural space.<br /><br /> How effective is therapy with Platelet Lysate?<br /><br /> This procedure can provide relief for a variety of conditions, although, it may vary in effectiveness. It helps the body to do what comes naturally, yet, because every patient’s healing process is different, it will reflect those results. This means that some patients might only need a single treatment, where others will require additional treatments.<br /><br /> Additionally, the reaction may depend on the following factors.<br /><br /> Different conditions or health factors that may attribute to slow healing<br /><br /> Activities after the treatment<br /><br /> Your overall health condition<br /><br /> Response and status of your immune system<br /><br /> Degrees of the damage<br /><br /> The specific area that is damaged<br /><br /> A patient’s age<br /><br /> Advantages of this therapy<br /><br /> There are many advantages with such an innovative therapy which can outweigh problems commonly related to different treatments like steroid injections or surgeries.<br /><br /> Advantages of Platelet Lysate therapy may include the following:<br /><br /> It’s related to healing over the long-term<br /><br /> Easy to perform and prepare<br /><br /> Less inflammatory effects<br /><br /> Recovery periods can be short<br /><br /> Natural cell regeneration<br /><br /> Using a person’s own power of healing<br /><br /> Non-invasive procedure<br /><br /> Such a procedure speeds up the process of natural healing due to the fact that growth factors can be available immediately to tissues that are damaged. It will be directly injected into the area that is damaged, immediately starting the process of healing.<br /><br /> It’s possible to apply Platelet Lysate treatment therapy any number of times. This will depend on what your body may need. When experiencing great improvement its fine to slow down or even stop treatments. On the other hand, when the body is in need of extra support, there won’t be a problem to carry on with the treatment.<br /><br /><br /><br /> About advanced PRP and Platelet Lysate procedures<br /><br /> Treatments with injections of PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, as well as Platelet Lysate contains components of healing and growths that is collected from a person’s own blood. This is used to increase the body’s ability of naturally repairing itself.<br /><br /> These procedures can be used to repair muscle, ligament, tendon, and joint injuries. Thus, it has become very popular among professional athletes. The injections are very effective due to the fact that it stimulates stem cells in the area that is targeted. It promotes those cells to work harder on tissue that is damaged for quicker healing. It is generally used for conditions of the spine, injuries of soft tissues, and mild arthritis.<br /><br /> The procedure of Platelet Lysate therapy<br /><br /> This procedure has less pain and fewer complications than what surgery offers. The doctor will discuss your condition and how the therapy can help you. Together a decision might be made whether it may be right for you.<br /><br /> It’s a fairly simple procedure and the following steps can be done:<br /><br /> To re-inject a mixture of Platelet Lysate into tissues that are damaged, cells are removed from a person’s own blood.<br /><br /> A tiny sample of the blood gets collected to separate platelets out of other components of the blood in order to create PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma.<br /><br /> This will then be subjected to a couple of series of freezing and thawing cycles. This carefully breaks the platelets apart to release its growth factors.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The Platelet Lysate results can then be combined together with just a tiny quantity of some anti-inflammatory medication such as Dexamethasone prior to being injected. Once done, it is injected into the area that is damaged using fluoroscopy or ultrasound which is guided techniques.<br /><br /> Once the procedure is done, you need to plan for enough rest, plus restricting activities for at least forty-eight hours. It might take some time before you will realize that the treatment is working. But once your activities or movements increases and you experience less pain you will know. You can decrease or increase treatments depending on how you feel.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-10 00:00:00	349	m2m
102	53	2	Can Perineal Massage Help You Avoid the Episiotomy?	Labor is a very painful and intense ordeal. The duration of this experience depends a lot on the strength of the contractions, the size of the baby, and the anatomy of the birth canal. The perineum is the area of the body between the anus and the vulva. You should rub or knead the muscles in order to relieve muscle tension. Perineal massage consists in rubbing or kneading the perineal muscles of a pregnant woman in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to allow these muscles and the surrounding tissue of the birth canal to stretch and relax prior delivery so an episiotomy can be avoided. When the canal birth is too narrow and when the baby is putting too much pressure on this area during childbirth, an episiotomy is required. An episiotomy is a cutting of the muscular area, commonly known as the perineum in order to help enlarge the vaginal opening during childbirth.<br /><br /> This area is exactly located between the vagina and the anus. It is normally done when the perineum is too rigid and too tight to allow a normal and easy delivery. It is also done to prevent tearing of the perineal wall as the baby tries to pass through the birth canal. It is also performed in order to allow a fast delivery of the baby. An episiotomy is seen as a necessary evil because, despite the practical reasons for doing it, it leads to some extra pain and discomfort after birth.<br /><br /> This can last up to a couple of days or a couple of weeks. It also changes the structure of the perineum permanently, as most of the muscles get replaced by a scar tissue. To reduce the possibility of an episiotomy, or a perineal tear, several practices have been tried over the years, and perineal massage is one of those. Perineal massage has a long and rich history, with the Chukchi Eskimos in Siberia using glass bottles and African tribes using gourds.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to increase the size of the vaginal canal and to increase the elasticity of the perineal area. The beautiful thing about a perineal massage is that it is relatively easy to perform. It does not require any special equipment, and you or your partner can do it in the absence of any medical professional. The massage is preferably done after taking a bath. You will need to take a comfortable position, wash your hands and lubricate your thumb with a water-based lubricant.<br /><br /> You can choose natural lubricants like olive oil or almond oil if you prefer. Once the hands are cleaned and lubricated, you need to place the thumb inside the vagina. The thumb should be inserted until the first knuckle of it is at the same level with the mouth of the vagina. This means that about 1-1.5 inches of your thumb would be inserted into the vagina. With the thumbs still in the vagina, push downwards towards the direction of the anus, and outwards towards the sides.<br /><br /> Keep pushing till you feel a burning and a stretching sensation. Hold your thumbs in place at this point for a minute or two. After that move your thumbs in around the lower half of the vagina by moving in a “U” shape from side to side for about 10 minutes. That way you will massage the side walls and the base of the vagina as well. Like massages on every other part of the body, it is not a one-time procedure, but should be done repeatedly.<br /><br /> Some experts recommend 6-10 sessions starting from 4-6 weeks before expected due date and continuing until the child is born. Interestingly, the upper half of the vagina does not need to be massaged, as it is surrounded by bones. The urethra is also found in this area, and any attempt to massage it may lead to some level of discomfort and even urinary tract infections.<br /><br /> You will want to avoid the upper half of the vagina during the perineal massage as you won’t have any profit from it. Women have reported an increase in the width of their birth canal with each session of perineal massage. Certain researchers have also been conducted in order to show the effectiveness of the perineal massage in preventing perineal tears and episiotomy during delivery.<br /><br /> One of such research's in the UK noted that there was a 6.1% reduction in second and third - degree tears. And there were episiotomies in women who did perineal massage during the last month of their pregnancy. The effects were higher in women over the age of 30 years old who were having their first baby. This is probably because of the fact that older women normally have a more rigid perineum compared to women at their 20’s.<br /><br /> The perineal massage helps widen the birth canal and make its walls more elastic and less likely to tear. In younger women who were having their first babies, the effect on their still elastic perineum is minimal. For women who have had previous episiotomies and women who had perineal tears in their previous pregnancies, perineal massage does not have much effect. This is due to the fact that the scar tissue is already formed by the previous damage to the perineum.<br /><br /> Normally, this scar tissue is not that strong as the muscle is. Therefore, despite the massage, there is a minimal change in the width of their birth canal. However, these women can still need an episiotomy during the childbirth. Despite the effectiveness of the perineal massage, there are some people who it is not recommended for. These include women who have had preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes in the past, or currently have a vaginal infection.<br /><br /> It is also wise to stop perineal massage if it causes discomfort or stimulates contraction. Whether or not you decide to try the perineal massage, it is very important that you keep your appointments with your obstetrician. No amount of personal research can replace the competence of a skilled physician.<br /><br /><br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-01 00:00:00	379	m2m
103	53	2	Why Would Couples Choose a Procedure for Gender Selection?	Most couples would like to have children of both sexes, especially in our current way of life where more and more people prefer smaller families. This is due to the fact that everything is so expensive. With today technology it’s possible for doctors through fertility treatments that are more advanced, to identify female and male embryos.<br /><br /> This option is available to couples today. In addition, couples can now also avoid passing on genetic sex-linked disorders to their children. The same goes for parents that want to balance their family and already have a child or children of one sex. Choosing a child’s gender has been subjected to a variety of debates quite extensively due to ART/assisted reproductive technology since it started.<br /><br /><br /><br /> I was very lucky through the conventional way to have two children and one of each gender. Yet, many couples might try for conceiving a boy or a girl and don’t see success until maybe the fifth time. By selecting your baby’s gender which is also called family balancing, it’s possible to have both sexes and keep the family smaller. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> In certain countries, this procedure might only be permitted for preventing transmission of genetic sex-linked diseases. Although, in others, it can be a practice that is common in fertility clinics.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> During development of an embryo, the differentiation of gender may occur prior to fertilization. It’s usually determined by the contribution of genetic material of a father’s sperm because he carries an X and Y chromosome which is responsible for a baby’s gender. Women’s egg cells carry only the X chromosome which means the combination can either be XX for a girl and XY for a boy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to this factor, selecting a gender may involve manipulation during an early stage of embryonic development or fertilization. Techniques of assisted reproduction can allow couples in choosing their baby’s gender during these specific stages.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Stages may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br />Before you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This involves a procedure to choose a sperm for a couple’s desired gender prior to fertilization and allow the fertility doctor to perform it without using IVF. <br /><br />  <br /><br />After you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The doctor selects an embryo for the gender that is desired directly after it’s fertilized and then transfers the embryo back into the uterus of the mother.<br /><br />  <br /><br />While a woman is pregnant<br /><br /><br /><br /> In this case, a woman can voluntarily terminate her pregnancy, if the baby is not the gender they desire, which is called sex-selective abortion.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to reasons that are ethical, this type of abortion won’t be a recommended technique in choosing an unborn baby’s gender. Although, woman have the option to choose a VTOP/voluntary termination of pregnancy, which will purely depend on their choice.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Couples that choose a procedure to select the gender of their new baby will very often have opinions like these listed below.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Some couples believe if they have lost a child they can choose gender. Choosing a gender that is the same for their new baby won’t replace the one they have lost, but it might help them to work through the loss.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s been suggested that when a parent receives the gender of their choice, they can love the child more, but that is not really relevant to everyone.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This procedure may help in preventing any gender-related diseases of being transmitted to the new baby, which can benefit the child and the parent.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> New parents that plan for balancing their family with fewer children in this economy, might prefer selecting their children as it will be easier to provide them with what they need.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> For a part of the community that doesn’t believe in choosing your child’s gender, it can raise the following points as listed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> They feel it’s not really necessary and very expensive, as well as the fact that it won’t increase the likelihood to fall pregnant.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s not always a hundred percent accurate except when the chosen technique is IVF together with PGD to select the gender, but it’s the option that is most expensive.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Most couples prefer to guess their baby’s gender while pregnant. Thus, by choosing the gender up front, it can eliminate the surprise element. However, a couple that wants a boy and a girl, who after four tries, just have either boys or girls, won’t agree with a guessing game.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Sometimes others might say it may contribute to inequality of gender and cause an imbalance.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2017.

104	53	2	How Can Osseous Surgery Benefit You	Generally, to live a healthy life, your oral health plays an important role. A mouth that is clean is not just necessary for appearance and to eat with comfort, but it also will reduce the risk to develop infection and disease. With any periodontal disease, bacteria within the mouth may easily be carried into different areas of the body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You should consult your dentist for assistance in regards to reclaiming your oral hygiene. Thus, keeping it at a level that is high. It’s important to fill cavities, plus remove any teeth that can’t be repaired. To do so, you also might need treatments like osseous surgery to reach your goal. In order to undergo this specific procedure, it’s necessary to understand what it entitles, as well as the benefits and risks.<br /><br /> About osseous surgery and the reason for doing it<br /><br /> People that suffer from a periodontal disease will be at risk that their teeth, gums, and bone can be destroyed. This disease causes pockets to form around teeth, which is very common and it can spread to other teeth as well. Additionally, it can develop into a breeding ground that increases infections throughout the body. With a mouth that is healthy, gums fit snugly against the teeth to prevent bacteria and food of reaching the area below the gum line.<br /><br /> In the beginning of this condition, it is easier to remove debris from problem areas, but as time goes by, treatment may be difficult, or sometimes even impossible to correct. The dentist will be able to clean the pockets through a reduction surgery for pocket depth’s and prevent further damage along with any infections. It can help you to keep a healthy and cleaner mouth, provided that you maintain good routines of oral health and go for dental cleanings regularly.<br /><br /> The main aim of osseous surgery is to remove all bacteria and debris from your pockets. Gum tissue will be folded back to expose the area around your tooth to clean it. If the tissue of your bone is also damaged, the dentist can smooth it as well. Bacteria can grow and hide even in the smallest of irregularities of your bone. This procedure can allow the tissue of the gum to reattach to the bone that is healthy more effectively.<br /><br /> Afterwards, your dentist can remove some extra tissue of the gum and use tiny stitches to keep your gum in its place to allow for natural healing. Sometimes, they might use a special kind of bandage for dentals.<br /><br /> It’s possible to experience swelling after your surgery, therefore you should apply on the outside an ice pack covering the area that is treated. This will help to reduce any discomfort. Your dentist might also prescribe antibiotics for prior, during, as well as after you have had your treatment.<br /><br /> Some risks factors<br /><br /> The same as any other surgical procedure, osseous surgery can also have risks. Even if you take proper care of your mouth, there might be a chance of infection to develop within the area. Although, by keeping up good oral care and if aftercare is performed properly, it may minimize your risk.<br /><br /> Additionally, gum tissue around your teeth that are treated can recede faster than the rest of the gums. This can cause your treated teeth to look as if they are longer than what the other teeth are. However, when this happens your dentist will be able to treat it.<br /><br /> Different risks might include sensitivities that can increase towards temperatures. It may be necessary to drink beverages that are cold through a straw and to avoid chewing foods that are very hot with your treated teeth. Because these teeth may be at a higher risk for cavities that is root-based, it’s very important to maintain oral care at a level that is high. <br /><br /> Benefits of this surgery<br /><br /> Recovery is easy and fast<br /><br /> Prevent future bacteria buildup<br /><br /> It can smooth a service that is irregular<br /><br /> Damage can be prevented<br /><br /> Attacking all bacteria<br /><br /> Pocket depth can be reduced<br /><br /> Your gums and teeth should fit together snugly in order to protect teeth from every type of infection.

105	53	2	And So Our Holiday Truly Starts	My heart starts to race excitedly and the plane starts it's decent. We are here, finally, we are here. It has felt like an eternity before our ocean holiday eventually started.<br /><br /> When my husband and myself got married, we procured some holiday points. It helps a lot as all the places to go to on holiday is sooo expensive.<br /><br /> So, since then we have had a tradition to save up our points for 3 years and then go on one nice long holiday. And here we are again. The ocean is calling, beckoning us to its shores with 3 kids in tow now.<br /><br /> Before our trip, we made a turn at our doctor to ensure the area where we were going was safe. We asked about injections for malaria and other viruses that may be present in the area. Once everything was medically done and safe we were on our way.<br /><br />Renting a car, first things first. <br /><br /> After getting our luggage we all followed Papa bear to the car rental service at the airport. While walking, the kids are having an argument about what color the car should be. Child no 1 wants a Pink car, really, can’t see that one happening, no 2 wants a blue car and no 3, well, she’s just looking at them as if a ball is being passed.<br /><br /> Papa bear winks at me when we get to the front desk of the rental car company, then he puts on an extremely serious face as he continues to ask – “Hi, there, please sir, my daughter wants a pink car, any in stock?”<br /><br /> I feel a giggle rising up at the pit of my stomach but manage to keep a straight face. No 1 is looking with so much expectation at the rental guy that I’m sure his squirming under the intensity of her stare.<br /><br /> To Mr rentals credit, he smiles and very seriously replies – “I am so sorry sir, the last pink chariot has left the building prior to your arrival.” No 1’s face drops with disappointment. Papa bear turns and says “So sorry honey bun, no pink ones. Maybe next time.”<br /><br /> “So, what do you have in blue?” Mr rental guy smiles and starts to tell us all our options. We ended up deciding between 3.<br /><br /> Chrysler town got an immediate no from papa bear. I knew why he’s itching to test drive either the Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape. So, when the Rental guy did not mention either of those in blue, I knew it was coming.<br /><br /> “Do you have either Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape?”<br /><br /> I could see the pent-up excitement on his face. When Mr. Rental guy confirmed that they do in fact have a 2016 Ford Escape in red, I could see papa bear jumping up and down on the inside.<br /><br /> “So kids, what about a red car?” They were easily persuaded and Papa bear was ecstatic. I did not dare touch him due to fear of being shocked. Seriously, if I looked closer, I was sure I could see tiny static running all over his being.<br /><br />Here we go<br /><br /> The bonus of flying is that there is not so much luggage. Thus, the luggage fitted in the Escape without any difficulty.<br /><br /> The nice thing about renting a car is that you get to properly test drive a car, in our case for two weeks. Papa bear was like a little boy as he was cruising down the highway. He was explaining to me about the 1.6L engine that delivers 178hp at 5700rpm. Additionally, the base model is front wheel drive and the one we are currently driving is an all-wheel-drive model. It also features a 15.5-gallon gas tank and delivers a fuel consumption of 22/29mpg.<br /><br /> He was carrying on like a dedicated car salesman. I smiled and made an hmm sound while I smiled and nodded at all the appropriate spaces. I knew this big boy was just like a little boy with a new toy. As they say right, boys and their toys…<br /><br />Meeting the local seagulls<br /><br /> We went to a nice little roadhouse next to the beach for some lunch. We got our order and parked the Escape so that we were overlooking the ocean. We sat outside on the rocks. Such a nice view as the waves broke and the wind gently sprayed us with ocean mist.<br /><br /> No 2 was holding a fry out of the window as he stared across the ocean when suddenly something grabbed the fry out of his hand. He screamed like a little girl! <br /><br /> A seagull took advantage of the hypnotic effect of the ocean and before we knew it we were surrounded by fry-stealing seagulls coming from who knows where.<br /><br /> Suddenly, we knew what it felt like to be surrounded.<br /><br /> The kids freely gave up the last of their fries in fear of seagull stares going mafia on us or being bitten. This, we took as our queue to get moving again.<br /><br />The Escape<br /><br /> The rest of our trip ran smoothly even though we had two nights of extreme mozzy (miskito, the insect kind) attacks, we knew all was fine. Everyone had their injections and no viruses were going to make us ill.<br /><br /> We enjoyed BBQ’s in the sunset overlooking the ocean and playing in the sand. We even got the opportunity to see some crabs and dolphins.<br /><br /> The thing I loved about the Escape, the SUV, is the large back seat, the kids had a ball, with plenty of space for themselves. The front seemed a bit smaller than with other SUV’s I’ve seen but the backseat and the luggage space makes up for it.<br /><br /> Some other small things that also made me like the Escape was the cruise control, backup camera and illuminating vanity mirrors. But the best is the overhead storage compartment, I could really get used to those. I can start to see why Papa Bear had his eye on the Escape. I just wonder does it come in pink?<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br /> The trip was amazing, we loved the Ford Escape and the escape from our busy lives’. The calming effect of the oceans draw refreshed us and we gained new strength to face our lives back home again. We were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br /><br /> How awesome was the fact that we need not drive all those miles back home. We got on an airplane with the refreshing effects of a 2-week ocean holiday still lingering all around us even as we got back home. On top of it all, we were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br />Article last time updated on 12.10.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-10-01 00:00:00	244	m2m
106	53	2	Everything You Should Know About a YAG Capsulotomy Procedure	Yttrium Aluminum Garnet also called YAG, is a procedure that produces infra-red laser light impulses. It is used to create small openings within tissue that are targeted through a process known as photo-disruption. Generally, it’s used for treating the iris and secondary cataracts. Sometimes doctors might also use it in treating problems with the retina at the eye’s back.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Indications<br /><br /> There is a variety of eye conditions treatable with this procedure. Conditions of the eyes that can be treated with a YAG capsulotomy procedure may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    If there are vision interferences with activities during the day.<br /><br /> •    When vision in patients decreases that have multifocal intraocular lenses that might specifically be sensitive to even tiny changes of the posterior capsular.<br /><br /> •    Increased glaring.<br /><br /> •    Difficulty to visualize the fundus.<br /><br /> •    With Z syndrome and lens tilting that is related to hinge compliant lenses, like the Trulign toric and Crystalens lenses. Z syndrome may occur if one hap tic arched posterior and the other anterior, and lens tilting can occur if one hap tic is arched either posterior or anterior and the other is planar.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In some cases, it’s possible for a tiny anterior capsular contraction, capsulorrhexis or capsular phimosis may occur. With such excessive anterior scarring to your intra-ocular lens, it might compromise your vision. Alleviation by anterior radial capsulotomies will be achieved through YAG laser treatment.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> About the procedure<br /><br /> To remove the haze capsule is a minor procedure that only requires dilation of your eye.<br /><br /> The doctor will numb your eye’s front by using special eye drops, after which he/she places a tiny contact lens on the eye. Then your head needs to rest on the YAG laser machine’s frame so that your doctor can focus the laser onto the capsule.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Small holes will be made by this laser into the capsule, in such a pattern which allows the doctor to determine what can be the best treatment for your specific condition.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Because there isn’t any incision required, you won’t feel pain or be at risk to develop infections. However, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drops for your eyes after the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Benefits of YAG capsulotomy procedures<br /><br /> •    The treatment is basically pain-free.<br /><br /> •    There isn’t any risk to get an infection.<br /><br /> •    It’s an outpatient treatment procedure.<br /><br /> •    Less healing time and trauma for your eye.<br /><br /> •    The procedure only lasts for a few minutes, though you might have to stay between one and two hours.<br /><br /> •    Reduced cost.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Recovery after the procedure<br /><br /> After the procedure, you can immediately resume normal activities and expect improvement of your vision within one day. Yet, you might experience some degree of floaters for a couple of weeks following the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> At the completion of the procedure, it’s important after a week to go back for a follow-up so that your doctor can examine the overall results, vision, and pressure. You should only as a precaution each day after your procedure tests your eye sight. Do this by closing your eye which hasn't had the surgery, and checks your eye’s vision.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Every year following the treatment you need to go for a checkup of your eyes. This is done to check for any other problems, as well as glaucoma because if your eye is just slightly unusual, examinations are critical.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Any possible risks to a YAG Capsulotomy procedure<br /><br /> Serious problems are very rare in a posterior YAG capsulotomy because it’s an extremely effective and safe procedure. However, the same as with any type of medical procedure, there might be some degree of risks involved.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The one that is very common may be the pressure that rises within your eye. When this happens the doctor can prescribe some eye drops, or maybe some combination of drops and tablets for reducing this pressure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A risk that might be a bit higher can be the detachment of your retina, as well as swelling of your macula. Nonetheless, both of these risks are quite rare, if your original surgery for cataracts with laser treatment was performed over six months earlier.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> By consulting an experienced professional eye specialist for this procedure, it may minimize your risks significantly involving posterior YAG capsulotomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Once your doctor and you decided that a posterior YAG capsulotomy will be the right choice for you, the doctor can provide you with extra information to allow you in making an informed decision of whether you want to proceed. Make sure that all questions you may have are answered to your full satisfaction.<br />Article last time updated on 24.08.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-08-24 00:00:00	365	m2m
107	53	2	Hysterectomy Types and Complications	What is a Hysterectomy and why is it performed?<br /><br /><br /><br /> A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that consists of removing the uterus. The uterus of a woman may cause pain due to a medical issue. In this case, a doctor or gynecologist can examine the uterus and run some tests to see what the issue is. If it cannot be cured, the uterus may be removed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The most common reasons a woman needs to undergo a hysterectomy procedure are as follow:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Uterine fibroids,<br /><br /> •    Endometriosis,<br /><br /> •    Adenomyosis,<br /><br /> •    Abnormal vaginal bleeding,<br /><br /> •    Chronic pelvic pain,<br /><br /> •    Pelvic inflammatory disease,<br /><br /> •    Cervical dysplasia,<br /><br /> •    Cervical cancer,<br /><br /> •    Uterine cancer,<br /><br /> •    Ovarian cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy types<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Today, there are different surgical techniques used for performing a hysterectomy when needed, such as:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Vaginal hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed through the vagina. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of endometrial hyperplasia, cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Total abdominal hysterectomy – is the most common type of hysterectomy performed among women worldwide. This surgical procedure consists of a total removal of the uterus including the cervix. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of ovary cancer, uterine cancer, large uterine fibroids, endometriosis, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Supracervical hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed but the cervix is spared. A supracervical hysterectomy is recommended in cases when there is no medical indication for removing the cervix. However, later in life, there is always the possibility of cancer development in this part of the cervix that has not been surgically removed at the same time as the uterus.  This type of hysterectomy decreases the risk of vaginal prolapse as it provides some kind of support for the vagina.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopy – assisted vaginal hysterectomy – is a similar surgical procedure to the vaginal hysterectomy, but includes the use of a laparoscope. During this procedure, the upper part of the abdomen is carefully inspected when needed. Such as in cases when the removal of the ovaries is planned as well, or in cases of early stages of endometrial cancer.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy – is similar to laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Though, the difference between these two surgical procedures consists of the fact that in laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy the uterus is separated from the cervix and later removed through a laparoscopic incision. The cervix is preserved in this type of surgery. Thus, the recovery period is faster.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Radical hysterectomy – is an extensive type of surgery usually performed in cases where early stages of cervical cancer are noted. This surgical procedure consists of not only removing the uterus and the cervix but also removing the upper part of the vagina and the surrounding tissues as well. There is a great possibility of a urinary system injury, as well as a bowel injury.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Oophorectomy and scalping - oophorectomy is a surgical procedure which consists of the removal of the ovaries in cases of oophorectomy. In the case of scalping - oophorectomy the adjacent Fallopian tubes are removed as well. These two surgical procedures combined with hysterectomy are performed in cases of ovarian cancer, Fallopian tube cancer, uterine cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy Complications<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Just like any surgical procedure, a hysterectomy has its own risks and possible complications. However, in most of the cases, women do not have any complications at all after this surgical procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> According to different studies, vaginal hysterectomies are linked with fewer risks and complications when compared to abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomies. The more radical the surgical procedure is the greater is the possibility of various risks and complications following hysterectomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Also, the recovery period is shorter in cases of vaginal hysterectomy, when compared to laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomies. Hysterectomy risks and complications greatly depend upon the type of hysterectomy procedure performed, as well as, the overall health of the women undergoing the surgery.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Common risks and complications following a hysterectomy regarding of its type include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Blood clots,<br /><br /> •    Heavy blood loss,<br /><br /> •    Bladder injury,<br /><br /> •    Bowel injury,<br /><br /> •    Infection,<br /><br /> •    Adhesions in the pelvic area,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Weakness of the pelvic muscles and ligaments which normally support the vagina, rectum and the bladder,<br /><br /> •    Difficulties urinating,<br /><br /> •    Early menopause,<br /><br /> •    Anesthesia problems, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Recovering after hysterectomy<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Even though a hysterectomy is a safe surgical procedure, it is often associated with various risks and complications. In general, hospitalization for a couple of days and sometimes weeks following the surgery is required. It only depends on the overall health of the patient and the reason why this procedure is performed in the first place. The recovery period will also depend on the type of hysterectomy performed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In cases of vaginal hysterectomy, the recovery period is faster compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, and even longer for an abdominal hysterectomy. After a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, women should be able to return to their normal daily routines within three to four weeks. In cases of abdominal hysterectomy, the recovery period will take a little bit longer, about four to six weeks.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> However, for a certain period of time after the surgery lifting heavy things, pushing or pulling objects, bending and even sexual intercourse should be avoided.<br />Article last time updated on 23.08.2017.

108	54	2	Cervical Biopsy And Pregnancy	There are many discussions about the cervical biopsy during pregnancy. Usually this type of diagnostics is appointed by gynecologists only on serious reason. This reason is the suspicion on some oncology disease in a patient. The tissues of the uterus must undergo a thorough analysis to determine the clinical picture. There is a popular meaning among doctors that only women who have already gone through labor may undergo it and certainly, it is forbidden to the patients expecting a baby.<br /><br /> A pregnant women undergoes plenty of different analyses. Among them are those which are necessary for every pregnant woman and some individual ones in case if the doctor has suspicions. The cervical biopsy is appointed if there are reasons to think about some pathological processes in the uterus. Still, it is rather an unwanted procedure during the pregnancy.<br /><br /> How does the cervical biopsy perform? The cervix is forced to protrude and it is actually traumatized by taking the examples of tissues for the examination. Of course, the uterus will react on this traumatization. It will constrict and there is a big chance of the pregnancy miscarriage.<br /><br /> However, sometimes the reasons for this appointment are quite serious. If there is a cancer diagnosed, sometimes it is required to get rid of the pregnancy to save a woman’s life. Nevertheless, if the situation is not that dangerous, it is better to start treatment after the labor. The earlier stages of cancer usually allows a woman to carry the pregnancy and undergo labor.<br /><br /> If there is an appointment of cervical biopsy in a pregnant woman, perhaps there can be the other way. It will be better to consult some more specialists or undergo additional analyses. If the reason is erosion or dysplasia, there is no emergency in doing biopsy. It can wait until the labor. Sometimes erosion just passes after it, so do not hurry with decisions.<br />Article last time updated on 04.01.2018.	Amelia Grant	2018-01-03 00:00:00	170	m2m
109	54	2	Teeth Sensitivity In Children	If adults suffer from sensitive teeth very much, imagine how terrible this feeling for children is. If the adult can verbalize his complaints and give a clue about the pain’s localization, with children it is not that simple. A child hardly can explain the character of the tooth pain. It is very difficult to know whether it is the increased sensitivity or something else. The only information parents usually receive is an abstract teeth pain while eating or brushing. Therefore, the reason cannot be clearly determined without visit to dentist. <br /><br />  <br /><br />There is a list of main factors provoking the increased sensitivity of kid’s teeth.<br /><br />1.       Caries. If a child’s tooth or several of them became sensitive, it may mean that there are cavities in those teeth. It is one of the most widely spread reasons of such problem in children. <br /><br />2.       Freshly appeared teeth. When primary teeth are lost, the new teeth may bother a child. They have not enough strength to resist the influence of air, sour and cold food.<br /><br />3.       Sinusitis. It seems that there is no connection between teeth sensitivity and sinus problems. However, it is a tendency of these two diseases often going together. <br /><br />4.       Filling material. If a child’s teeth were restored with the usage of silver amalgam, they can become sensitive afterwards. It is connected with high thermal conductivity qualities of this material.<br /><br />5.       Enamel fractures. They occur not only in adults. If a child has problems with occlusion or bruxism, tiny fractures can appear on his teeth and bring him much discomfort. Especially they are painful during eating.<br /><br />6.       Wrong cleaning technique. It is not a widely spread reason of teeth sensitivity in children but still there is such chance. If a child brushes his teeth too aggressively, he can traumatize a gum and an enamel of teeth. That is why teaching children proper techniques of mouth hygiene from the earliest age is very important.<br /> Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-26 00:00:00	160	m2m
110	54	2	3D-Layering in Cosmetic Dentistry	We live in an era of astonishing scientific and technological progress. The technologies are improving faster than we could ever believe it possible. The progress touches all the spheres of our living including healthcare. The newest scientific achievements are making the process of treatment more effective, convenient and fast. It is especially important for dentistry service that is to improve not only the existing mouth health problems but the aesthetic ones too. The 3D-technologies are here to make a revolution in the cosmetic dentistry.<br /><br /> Let us take a front tooth fracture for an example. It is quite a common thing in childish age. As a rule, the problem occurs because of the tooth trauma. The traditional strategy of treatment in such cases is adhesive restoration of the tooth. It is very difficult to match the color of the composite perfectly to the natural color of the patient’s teeth. 3D technologies allow the convenient and effective process of the color selection with usage of the innovational composite materials.<br /><br /> The model of a tooth that needs to be restored is printed on 3D-printer and doubled with the use of the special form for the individual scheme of shades. The special computer program helps with that. The shades of enamel and dentine are determined before the restoration of the tooth and creating an individual shade scheme. The special SpectroShade device determines the exact shade needed and the thickness of enamel and dentin.<br /><br /> The i3D- technology fully reconstructs the 3D-structure of the real tooth. Materials allows to be corrected within the limits of a certain thickness. Some additional effects allow being placed between the dentin and enamel if necessary. As a final part of the restoration, the material is applied layer by layer. The i3D layering technique  is proven to be a perspective for the further innovations in the field of composite materials’ production.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.

111	54	2	Nuvaring: Pros And Cons	Nuvaring is one of the innovational method of contraception. It has hormonal action but does not come in the form of pills. It is a hypoallergenic hormonal ring that is inserted into a woman’s vagina. The ring is elastic and when inserted into a woman’s body, repeats the shape of her inside.  It contains micro doses of such hormones as estrogen and progestagen that prevent pregnancy. It is a monophasic combined contraceptive method that is inserted by woman herself in one of the first five days of menstrual period.<br /><br />How does Nuvaring work? Under the influence of the temperature of a woman’s body, a ring extracts little doses of hormones every day. They get straight into the ovaries and uterus and interfere with the ovulation process.  This process does not involve the endocrine system because the hormones are getting into a woman’s sex organs at once. That is why Nuvaring does not give a woman many of the side effects going together with oral contraceptives.<br /><br /> The undoubted advantages of the Nuvaring use are:<br /><br /> It does not interfere with sexual intercourse and has no influence on the both partners’ feelings.<br /><br /> It is inserted once a month. A woman does not have to bother herself with remembering to take the pill by schedule.<br /><br /> It does not influence a woman’s way of life. She can do sports and lead an active life without even a feeling of something foreign inside her.<br /><br /> It has quite a good percentage of effectiveness – 99, 9%.<br /><br /> It is available to purchase in many places.<br /><br /> But it also has its drawbacks:<br /><br />  There is quite a big list of contraindications. Among them are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, gynecological diseases, kidney diseases.<br /><br />  It does not provide any STD prevention.<br /><br />  A woman must not use it while breastfeeding.<br /><br />  The price of Nuvaring is rather high.<br /><br /> It also has its certain side effects. Among them are headache, dizziness and even vomiting, allergic reaction and vaginitis. Sometimes the individual specialties of a woman’s organism do not allow her using Nuvaring, so the full diagnostic of organism before choosing it is recommended.<br />Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.

112	54	2	The Laser Treatment Of Periodontitis	Periodontitis is a severe gum disease that can lead to a loss of teeth. The innovational treatment strategies are constantly improved to cope with it more successfully. Among the newest periodontitis treatment strategies is laser gum surgery. Laser technique can help even in the most neglected cases. How is the treatment of periodontitis possible with the help of laser? The laser optical fiber is inserted into the gum pocket. It coagulates the pathological tissue. The special lighting of the fiber allows controlling the depth of laser penetration. It helps working accurately with tissue not to harm healthy ones.<br /><br /> When the treatment ends, the pocket is left sterile, it closes and does not allow harmful bacteria get in there. If it is the earlier stage of periodontitis, one séance may be enough. If the disease progressed, 2-3 séances are required. They must perform once a week. Different types of laser may be used, the doctor determines which will be better for that individual case.<br /><br /> The advantages of periodontitis laser treatment are obvious. These are:<br /><br />  No blood. During the laser action all the tine vessels are soldered.<br /><br />  No pain. The treatment can perform without any anesthesia. A patient does not feel any  discomfort during the procedure. He can go back to his usual life right after the procedure.<br /><br />  Additional polishing of the tooth root tissues. As the result of treatment a gum sticks tight to the tooth.<br /><br />  A small list of contraindications. Even small children, pregnant women and patients with allergy can undergo the procedure. The treatment with laser does not take much of a patient’s time. It is rather effective, even the first procedure gives good result.<br /><br />  Laser periodontitis treatment does not require any preparations. The procedure is not traumatic and does not require any long recovery. Laser rays destroy any pathological microflora. The procedure guarantees sterility and reduces chances on disease in future.<br /> Article last time updated on 22.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-22 00:00:00	165	m2m
113	54	2	Turner’s Hypoplasia Diagnostics	White spots on baby teeth are not just a cosmetic defect. They may be the sign of the enamel hypoplasia. Enamel hypoplasia means incomplete or defective formation of the teeth enamel organic matrix on the germ stage. Hypoplastic effect damages the tooth surface and shape. In most of the cases, it expresses through the local loss of the tooth enamel. It looks like a single lacuna or a row of them surrounding the tooth horizontally. Those lacunae also can conjoin in one fissure. The other severe form of hypoplasia is hypocalсification of enamel. If hypoplasia is the defective formation of the enamel matrix that causes lack of the tissue, hypocalcification provides enough tissue but of poor quality.<br /><br /> The case of Turner’s hypoplasia means an infection that attacks primary teeth or the germs of constant ones in the period of germ formation. Local infection near the apex or trauma of the primary tooth can touch the constant tooth germ too. If infection occurs in the process of the crown formation, it can lead to a further hypoplasia or hypomineralization of the enamel. Lower bicuspids suffer from Turner’s hypoplasia more often, because constant molars above them are very vulnerable to the infection. Constant central incisors mostly suffer from this disease as the result of primary teeth trauma.<br /><br /> The visual diagnostic of Turner’s hypoplasia is possible because the discoloration and pathological changes of enamel are obvious. The X-ray examination may show the deformation of the apex or root, thus can give the ideas about the provoking factor of the disease. Histological analysis will help determine the deep structural changes of the enamel. The treatment of Turner’s hypoplasia requires a complex approach. According to the results of X-ray, the consequences of the problem (it may be trauma or infection) must undergo correction. The cosmetic defect is to be corrected by applying prostheses (veneers or crowns depending of the amount of enamel and dentin destruction).<br />Article last time updated on 21.12.2017.

114	54	2	Teeth Whitening Strips	Nowadays the domestic methods of teeth whitening gained much popularity. Doctors do not consider them the safest way of manipulations with teeth. However, thanks to the convenience and cheapness, they are widely used by many people. Among them quite popular is the method of teeth whitening stripes. The beauty bloggers are recommending them to people and there is a wide assortment of the stuff available. But is it really that safe and convenient?<br /><br /> Among the side effects of whitening stripes usage are inflammation of the gums and increased teeth sensitivity. This does not stop people who do not want to pay a fortune in a dentistry clinic for the professional procedure.

115	54	2	Sweet Addiction: First Signs Of The Problem	Perhaps, all people in the world like sweets. They are tasty and sometimes it seems impossible to resist the desire to have a doughnut or chocolate cake. It is no big deal to indulge yourself from time to time. However, consuming too much sugar containing products is extremely destructive for a human organism. It can even become a real drug with all the symptoms of addiction – abstinence syndrome, decreasing of the sensitivity and unpleasant side effects.<br /><br /> If you are the person who cannot live without chocolate, cakes or ice-cream, read this carefully. Here is the list of warning signs signalizing that you have a problem.<br /><br />  1. You literally ALWAYS want something sweet. And the more you eat it, the more you want. It works exactly like a drug. Your taste sensors adapt to the sweet taste with time and begin perceiving it weaker. It means that now you need more sweets to feel the same taste as you did before. Sugar provokes a hormonal splash. That is why you feel stronger and more energetic after eating something sweet. And when the level of sugar decreases, a wish to bring it back appears.<br /><br />  2. You feel weak throughout the day. A splash of insulin after eating sugar caused the splash of energy, but it will not last long. Energy is stable when the sugar level in blood is stable. And if it’s shattered, you feel misbalanced. Stable energy comes out of proteins and fiber, not from sugar.<br /><br />  3. The state of your skin is becoming worse. People who are sensitive to hormonal splashes often suffer from acne and rosacea. They visit dermatologists, try different treatment strategies but have no idea about the real reason of their problem.<br /><br />  4. Your mood goes up and down during the day. Sugar rises and falls, you feel energetic, then everything irritates you. Feeling of weakness does not help to be in good mood either.<br /><br />  5. You are gaining weight. Sugar contains many calories but little nutritive values. Insulin overproduction caused by it also provokes weight gain. Sugar consumption may cause insulin resistance that causes serious problems with metabolism.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 19.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-19 00:00:00	184	m2m
116	54	2	3D-Technologies In Osseous Surgery	There are many cases in medicine when a patient needs bone grafting. It may concern not only bone grafting for dental implants that can be successful set up only in case where enough bone tissue volume is present. Also bone impants are used in treating locomotor apparatus diseases and bone reconstructions. Nowadays there are four types of implants used for these purposes. A person can be his own bone donor – the missing bone tissue can be taken from his own body where the amount allows doing this. If there is no such possibility, other people may become bone donors. There are special programs that allows donating your body on such purposes after death.<br /><br /> But the bone tissue grafts can be taken not only from people. The cattle bones can also be used for implantation. They undergo multiple stages of sterilization to fit for human organism perfectly. Also there exist artificial bone grafts, but they are considered to be the least effective among all of them.<br /><br /> Now the scientists are working on the possibility to use 3D-thecnologies in creating the bone grafting materials. In John Hopkins University (USA) the mix of 30% natural de-cellulosed bone and 70% polymer was invented and tested.  3D-printing is known to reproduce the 3D-structures’ exact copies with full similarity on the thinnest levels. They combined bio-degrading plastic with natural sterilized bone and received good results allowing hopeful prognoses for future.<br /><br /> The scientists of Quebec University used 3D-technologies to print experimental mixes that have such important quality as ability to yield. Hard grafts lead to misbalance of jaws’ work and the wit the yielding grafts balancing abilities will be better. It will help avoid the bone resorption process. In addition, the anti-corrosion qualities of the invented mixes are excellent. It is believed to have very good perspectives for the wide usage in traumatology, spine medicine and orthopedics. <br />Article last time updated on 18.12.2017.

It is a result of getting of the pathogenic microorganisms into the knee and their multiplication. Often it occurs after the heavy traumas of the knee.<br /><br />  Immunity inflammation. It happens because of the excessive extraction of synovial liquid. Pathological immunity complexes damage the epithelium.<br /><br /> What are the main symptoms of liquid in a patient’s knee?<br /><br />  The increasing of the knee size.<br /><br />  Bound motor function – feeling difficulties during the attempts of bending the knee.<br /><br />  An intumescence on the knee that feels elastic and stiff.<br /><br />  Knee pain during the movements.<br /><br />  Reddening of the skin or feeling it hot.<br /><br /> The different types of inflammations require different ways of treatment.  Knee pain doctor will perform the diagnostic, determine the etymology of disease and appoint the suitable treatment strategy.

First of all, falling pregnant can already be stressful, especially if it comes with certain medical problems, when it’s unwanted, or even in rape cases.<br /><br /> Furthermore, we find that directly after a woman has had an abortion, she might experience unexpected emotions and reactions. Sometimes it’s also difficult to discuss it due to religious and cultural reasons. Many women might feel emotional distress and guilt caused by religious beliefs that normally creates a stigma concerning abortions.<br /><br /> However, most emotional and psychological responses related to an abortion is normal. Yet, it shouldn’t be severe or persistent enough to affect their daily lifestyle, it typically fades on its own.<br /><br />Some of these feelings naturally can include the following:<br /><br /> Loss of her self-esteem<br /><br /> Stress that can reduce her ability to cope<br /><br /> Regret or remorse<br /><br /> Guilt<br /><br /> Grief due to the sense of loss<br /><br /> Relief or anxiety<br /><br /> Not every woman will experience emotional responses that are negative with an abortion. Those that do shouldn’t have problems concerning their mental health that is lasting. Some might react positive and feel relief without any regrets. This is because they feel confident that their decision was a choice that is right for them. <br /><br /> About depression<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a mental or psychological condition of your health, also known as a mood disorder.<br /><br /> Some symptoms and signs you might experience when you are depressed can include:<br /><br /> Sleep patterns that are disturbed<br /><br /> Losing interest in any activities you used to enjoy<br /><br /> Lose your interest in having intercourse<br /><br /> Tiredness or lack of energy<br /><br /> Irritable feelings<br /><br /> Feeling guilty<br /><br /> Concentration that is poor, plus finds it difficult to make decisions<br /><br /> Your ability to think can be reduced<br /><br /> Experiencing sadness or feeling low<br /><br /> Depression can develop at various severity levels.

It might also have other effects such as loss of appetite which could cause loss of weight and even anorexia or bulimia.<br /><br /> Grief or depression due to an abortion<br /><br /> Grief is a reaction that is naturally occurring with the death of a loved one, but it shouldn’t cause depression over a long term.<br /><br /> To experience loss after termination of an unplanned pregnancy can also be natural, like due to an injury or illness. Yet, in this case, because of a spontaneous abortion, the symptoms might not last very long.<br /><br /> Most of the time, even if a woman decides on an abortion to terminate a pregnancy, she will still experience feelings that are natural of regret, guilt, grief, sadness, and loss afterward.<br /><br /> Risk factors for depression<br /><br /> Women with mental disorders prior to unwanted pregnancies who goes for an abortion can experience it differently as what healthy women would.

126	60	2	Treatments Used in Dental Habit Therapy That Can Help Your Child	It’s possible for anyone to develop bad habits during their life. In some cases, young children may have bad habits that could actually influence the function and development of their mouth, teeth, and jaws. Examples of this can be thumb sucking, mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting that are persistent.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The reflex of sucking can be a natural occurrence among children at an early age, which normally disappears between the ages of two and four years. However, if the problem persists after four years, the pressure on their upper jaw and front teeth may cause teeth to start moving apart. Plus, it can result in the jaw changing its shape. This conditions might impair their speech and also cause an open bite problem.<br /><br /> With mouth breathing, which relates to a pattern of breathing that is not normal, causing their mouths to remain always open. This can pass direct air into the lungs, and cause muscular alteration functions of their face and tongue. The lower and upper jaw may abnormally grow and cause orthodontic conditions that can be serious.<br /><br /> Some issues that will need habit therapy among children<br /><br /> Two issues that are known to be the biggest problem in children concerning bad habits can include finger or thumb sucking, plus tongue thrusting. The thrusting of the tongue can occur if a child pushes his/her tongue forward onto the teeth constantly. Most of the time they will outgrow such a habit at around four years old. Although, if it doesn’t happen, it may cause their teeth to misalign.<br /><br /> Side effects from misalignment might seriously affect how a child’s face looks. It’s important that you consult a professional dentist for correcting the problems since the child at such a young age won’t understand any of the consequences.<br /><br /> Thumb sucking treatment using orthodontic appliances<br /><br /><br /><br /> When your child persistently sucks his/her thumb, consider getting orthodontic treatment early for stopping this behavior, as well as preventing problems from developing. It’s important to help the child understand what problems can be associated with this habit and suggest different ways to stop it.<br /><br /> Different ways to try and stop the habit may include reminding them about the dangers of the habit. Additionally, at night time place a hand puppet, sock or mitten over the hand. Furthermore, consider using an elbow elastic support that might make it difficult for bending his/her elbow to prevent thumb sucking. Sometimes, these habits are an emotional comfort device and scolding can only worsen the situation.<br /><br /> However, when it doesn’t help, your dentist may suggest an orthodontic appliance, known as a tongue crib which painlessly and gently will stop thumb sucking completely. This treatment can physically prevent the habit and typically, your child’s habit should be over within a couple of months if wearing this appliance.<br /><br /> Treatment appliances for tongue thrusting<br /><br /> This habit happens when your child pushes his or her tongue against the teeth in front while they are swallowing or speaking. A parent might feel it’s not a big issue, though, as time goes by the pressure that is exerted through their tongue onto the teeth may relate to orthodontic open bite problems.<br /><br /> An appliance for tongue thrusting will correct such behavior and prevent the child from thrusting his/her tongue against the teeth. Thus, it can allow the teeth to develop as it should.<br /><br /> This appliance can be placed in a comfortable and safe way to correct the child’s habit. It’s a semi-permanent attachment to the teeth very similar to the way braces are fitted. For the duration it is worn, it will guide the child to correct his/her patterns of behavior. Sometimes it might also be recommended for a child to get a speech or exercise therapy together with such a dental appliance.<br /><br /> Sometimes success can be reached after only a couple of days. All the same, the time it takes doesn’t really matter because once the orthodontist can confirm your child is over the habit, they will remove the appliance. It’s very similar to a palatal crib which may typically be used for preventing a child to suck his/her thumb, it only differs from what this crib actually blocks.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

This carefully breaks the platelets apart to release its growth factors.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The Platelet Lysate results can then be combined together with just a tiny quantity of some anti-inflammatory medication such as Dexamethasone prior to being injected. Once done, it is injected into the area that is damaged using fluoroscopy or ultrasound which is guided techniques.<br /><br /> Once the procedure is done, you need to plan for enough rest, plus restricting activities for at least forty-eight hours.

128	60	2	Can Perineal Massage Help You Avoid the Episiotomy?	Labor is a very painful and intense ordeal. The duration of this experience depends a lot on the strength of the contractions, the size of the baby, and the anatomy of the birth canal. The perineum is the area of the body between the anus and the vulva. You should rub or knead the muscles in order to relieve muscle tension. Perineal massage consists in rubbing or kneading the perineal muscles of a pregnant woman in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to allow these muscles and the surrounding tissue of the birth canal to stretch and relax prior delivery so an episiotomy can be avoided. When the canal birth is too narrow and when the baby is putting too much pressure on this area during childbirth, an episiotomy is required. An episiotomy is a cutting of the muscular area, commonly known as the perineum in order to help enlarge the vaginal opening during childbirth.<br /><br /> This area is exactly located between the vagina and the anus. It is normally done when the perineum is too rigid and too tight to allow a normal and easy delivery. It is also done to prevent tearing of the perineal wall as the baby tries to pass through the birth canal. It is also performed in order to allow a fast delivery of the baby. An episiotomy is seen as a necessary evil because, despite the practical reasons for doing it, it leads to some extra pain and discomfort after birth.<br /><br /> This can last up to a couple of days or a couple of weeks. It also changes the structure of the perineum permanently, as most of the muscles get replaced by a scar tissue. To reduce the possibility of an episiotomy, or a perineal tear, several practices have been tried over the years, and perineal massage is one of those. Perineal massage has a long and rich history, with the Chukchi Eskimos in Siberia using glass bottles and African tribes using gourds.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to increase the size of the vaginal canal and to increase the elasticity of the perineal area. The beautiful thing about a perineal massage is that it is relatively easy to perform. It does not require any special equipment, and you or your partner can do it in the absence of any medical professional. The massage is preferably done after taking a bath. You will need to take a comfortable position, wash your hands and lubricate your thumb with a water-based lubricant.<br /><br /> You can choose natural lubricants like olive oil or almond oil if you prefer. Once the hands are cleaned and lubricated, you need to place the thumb inside the vagina. The thumb should be inserted until the first knuckle of it is at the same level with the mouth of the vagina. This means that about 1-1.5 inches of your thumb would be inserted into the vagina. With the thumbs still in the vagina, push downwards towards the direction of the anus, and outwards towards the sides.<br /><br /> Keep pushing till you feel a burning and a stretching sensation. Hold your thumbs in place at this point for a minute or two. After that move your thumbs in around the lower half of the vagina by moving in a “U” shape from side to side for about 10 minutes. That way you will massage the side walls and the base of the vagina as well. Like massages on every other part of the body, it is not a one-time procedure, but should be done repeatedly.<br /><br /> Some experts recommend 6-10 sessions starting from 4-6 weeks before expected due date and continuing until the child is born. Interestingly, the upper half of the vagina does not need to be massaged, as it is surrounded by bones. The urethra is also found in this area, and any attempt to massage it may lead to some level of discomfort and even urinary tract infections.<br /><br /> You will want to avoid the upper half of the vagina during the perineal massage as you won’t have any profit from it. Women have reported an increase in the width of their birth canal with each session of perineal massage. Certain researchers have also been conducted in order to show the effectiveness of the perineal massage in preventing perineal tears and episiotomy during delivery.<br /><br /> One of such research's in the UK noted that there was a 6.1% reduction in second and third - degree tears. And there were episiotomies in women who did perineal massage during the last month of their pregnancy. The effects were higher in women over the age of 30 years old who were having their first baby. This is probably because of the fact that older women normally have a more rigid perineum compared to women at their 20’s.<br /><br /> The perineal massage helps widen the birth canal and make its walls more elastic and less likely to tear. In younger women who were having their first babies, the effect on their still elastic perineum is minimal. For women who have had previous episiotomies and women who had perineal tears in their previous pregnancies, perineal massage does not have much effect. This is due to the fact that the scar tissue is already formed by the previous damage to the perineum.<br /><br /> Normally, this scar tissue is not that strong as the muscle is. Therefore, despite the massage, there is a minimal change in the width of their birth canal. However, these women can still need an episiotomy during the childbirth. Despite the effectiveness of the perineal massage, there are some people who it is not recommended for. These include women who have had preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes in the past, or currently have a vaginal infection.<br /><br /> It is also wise to stop perineal massage if it causes discomfort or stimulates contraction. Whether or not you decide to try the perineal massage, it is very important that you keep your appointments with your obstetrician. No amount of personal research can replace the competence of a skilled physician.<br /><br /><br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-01 00:00:00	379	m2m
129	60	2	Why Would Couples Choose a Procedure for Gender Selection?	Most couples would like to have children of both sexes, especially in our current way of life where more and more people prefer smaller families. This is due to the fact that everything is so expensive. With today technology it’s possible for doctors through fertility treatments that are more advanced, to identify female and male embryos.<br /><br /> This option is available to couples today. In addition, couples can now also avoid passing on genetic sex-linked disorders to their children. The same goes for parents that want to balance their family and already have a child or children of one sex. Choosing a child’s gender has been subjected to a variety of debates quite extensively due to ART/assisted reproductive technology since it started.<br /><br /><br /><br /> I was very lucky through the conventional way to have two children and one of each gender. Yet, many couples might try for conceiving a boy or a girl and don’t see success until maybe the fifth time. By selecting your baby’s gender which is also called family balancing, it’s possible to have both sexes and keep the family smaller. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> In certain countries, this procedure might only be permitted for preventing transmission of genetic sex-linked diseases. Although, in others, it can be a practice that is common in fertility clinics.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> During development of an embryo, the differentiation of gender may occur prior to fertilization. It’s usually determined by the contribution of genetic material of a father’s sperm because he carries an X and Y chromosome which is responsible for a baby’s gender. Women’s egg cells carry only the X chromosome which means the combination can either be XX for a girl and XY for a boy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to this factor, selecting a gender may involve manipulation during an early stage of embryonic development or fertilization. Techniques of assisted reproduction can allow couples in choosing their baby’s gender during these specific stages.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Stages may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br />Before you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This involves a procedure to choose a sperm for a couple’s desired gender prior to fertilization and allow the fertility doctor to perform it without using IVF. <br /><br />  <br /><br />After you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The doctor selects an embryo for the gender that is desired directly after it’s fertilized and then transfers the embryo back into the uterus of the mother.<br /><br />  <br /><br />While a woman is pregnant<br /><br /><br /><br /> In this case, a woman can voluntarily terminate her pregnancy, if the baby is not the gender they desire, which is called sex-selective abortion.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to reasons that are ethical, this type of abortion won’t be a recommended technique in choosing an unborn baby’s gender. Although, woman have the option to choose a VTOP/voluntary termination of pregnancy, which will purely depend on their choice.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Couples that choose a procedure to select the gender of their new baby will very often have opinions like these listed below.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Some couples believe if they have lost a child they can choose gender. Choosing a gender that is the same for their new baby won’t replace the one they have lost, but it might help them to work through the loss.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s been suggested that when a parent receives the gender of their choice, they can love the child more, but that is not really relevant to everyone.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This procedure may help in preventing any gender-related diseases of being transmitted to the new baby, which can benefit the child and the parent.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> New parents that plan for balancing their family with fewer children in this economy, might prefer selecting their children as it will be easier to provide them with what they need.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> For a part of the community that doesn’t believe in choosing your child’s gender, it can raise the following points as listed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> They feel it’s not really necessary and very expensive, as well as the fact that it won’t increase the likelihood to fall pregnant.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s not always a hundred percent accurate except when the chosen technique is IVF together with PGD to select the gender, but it’s the option that is most expensive.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Most couples prefer to guess their baby’s gender while pregnant. Thus, by choosing the gender up front, it can eliminate the surprise element. However, a couple that wants a boy and a girl, who after four tries, just have either boys or girls, won’t agree with a guessing game.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Sometimes others might say it may contribute to inequality of gender and cause an imbalance.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2017.

130	60	2	How Can Osseous Surgery Benefit You	Generally, to live a healthy life, your oral health plays an important role. A mouth that is clean is not just necessary for appearance and to eat with comfort, but it also will reduce the risk to develop infection and disease. With any periodontal disease, bacteria within the mouth may easily be carried into different areas of the body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You should consult your dentist for assistance in regards to reclaiming your oral hygiene. Thus, keeping it at a level that is high. It’s important to fill cavities, plus remove any teeth that can’t be repaired. To do so, you also might need treatments like osseous surgery to reach your goal. In order to undergo this specific procedure, it’s necessary to understand what it entitles, as well as the benefits and risks.<br /><br /> About osseous surgery and the reason for doing it<br /><br /> People that suffer from a periodontal disease will be at risk that their teeth, gums, and bone can be destroyed. This disease causes pockets to form around teeth, which is very common and it can spread to other teeth as well. Additionally, it can develop into a breeding ground that increases infections throughout the body. With a mouth that is healthy, gums fit snugly against the teeth to prevent bacteria and food of reaching the area below the gum line.<br /><br /> In the beginning of this condition, it is easier to remove debris from problem areas, but as time goes by, treatment may be difficult, or sometimes even impossible to correct. The dentist will be able to clean the pockets through a reduction surgery for pocket depth’s and prevent further damage along with any infections. It can help you to keep a healthy and cleaner mouth, provided that you maintain good routines of oral health and go for dental cleanings regularly.<br /><br /> The main aim of osseous surgery is to remove all bacteria and debris from your pockets. Gum tissue will be folded back to expose the area around your tooth to clean it. If the tissue of your bone is also damaged, the dentist can smooth it as well. Bacteria can grow and hide even in the smallest of irregularities of your bone. This procedure can allow the tissue of the gum to reattach to the bone that is healthy more effectively.<br /><br /> Afterwards, your dentist can remove some extra tissue of the gum and use tiny stitches to keep your gum in its place to allow for natural healing. Sometimes, they might use a special kind of bandage for dentals.<br /><br /> It’s possible to experience swelling after your surgery, therefore you should apply on the outside an ice pack covering the area that is treated. This will help to reduce any discomfort. Your dentist might also prescribe antibiotics for prior, during, as well as after you have had your treatment.<br /><br /> Some risks factors<br /><br /> The same as any other surgical procedure, osseous surgery can also have risks. Even if you take proper care of your mouth, there might be a chance of infection to develop within the area. Although, by keeping up good oral care and if aftercare is performed properly, it may minimize your risk.<br /><br /> Additionally, gum tissue around your teeth that are treated can recede faster than the rest of the gums. This can cause your treated teeth to look as if they are longer than what the other teeth are. However, when this happens your dentist will be able to treat it.<br /><br /> Different risks might include sensitivities that can increase towards temperatures. It may be necessary to drink beverages that are cold through a straw and to avoid chewing foods that are very hot with your treated teeth. Because these teeth may be at a higher risk for cavities that is root-based, it’s very important to maintain oral care at a level that is high. <br /><br /> Benefits of this surgery<br /><br /> Recovery is easy and fast<br /><br /> Prevent future bacteria buildup<br /><br /> It can smooth a service that is irregular<br /><br /> Damage can be prevented<br /><br /> Attacking all bacteria<br /><br /> Pocket depth can be reduced<br /><br /> Your gums and teeth should fit together snugly in order to protect teeth from every type of infection. Your dentist can provide the necessary treatments for restoring your oral health to what it should be. Always remember, follow up appointments is very important to keep your mouth healthy and ensure that it heals properly.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

131	60	2	And So Our Holiday Truly Starts	My heart starts to race excitedly and the plane starts it's decent. We are here, finally, we are here. It has felt like an eternity before our ocean holiday eventually started.<br /><br /> When my husband and myself got married, we procured some holiday points. It helps a lot as all the places to go to on holiday is sooo expensive.<br /><br /> So, since then we have had a tradition to save up our points for 3 years and then go on one nice long holiday. And here we are again. The ocean is calling, beckoning us to its shores with 3 kids in tow now.<br /><br /> Before our trip, we made a turn at our doctor to ensure the area where we were going was safe. We asked about injections for malaria and other viruses that may be present in the area. Once everything was medically done and safe we were on our way.<br /><br />Renting a car, first things first. <br /><br /> After getting our luggage we all followed Papa bear to the car rental service at the airport. While walking, the kids are having an argument about what color the car should be. Child no 1 wants a Pink car, really, can’t see that one happening, no 2 wants a blue car and no 3, well, she’s just looking at them as if a ball is being passed.<br /><br /> Papa bear winks at me when we get to the front desk of the rental car company, then he puts on an extremely serious face as he continues to ask – “Hi, there, please sir, my daughter wants a pink car, any in stock?”<br /><br /> I feel a giggle rising up at the pit of my stomach but manage to keep a straight face. No 1 is looking with so much expectation at the rental guy that I’m sure his squirming under the intensity of her stare.<br /><br /> To Mr rentals credit, he smiles and very seriously replies – “I am so sorry sir, the last pink chariot has left the building prior to your arrival.” No 1’s face drops with disappointment. Papa bear turns and says “So sorry honey bun, no pink ones. Maybe next time.”<br /><br /> “So, what do you have in blue?” Mr rental guy smiles and starts to tell us all our options. We ended up deciding between 3.<br /><br /> Chrysler town got an immediate no from papa bear. I knew why he’s itching to test drive either the Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape. So, when the Rental guy did not mention either of those in blue, I knew it was coming.<br /><br /> “Do you have either Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape?”<br /><br /> I could see the pent-up excitement on his face. When Mr. Rental guy confirmed that they do in fact have a 2016 Ford Escape in red, I could see papa bear jumping up and down on the inside.<br /><br /> “So kids, what about a red car?” They were easily persuaded and Papa bear was ecstatic. I did not dare touch him due to fear of being shocked. Seriously, if I looked closer, I was sure I could see tiny static running all over his being.<br /><br />Here we go<br /><br /> The bonus of flying is that there is not so much luggage. Thus, the luggage fitted in the Escape without any difficulty.<br /><br /> The nice thing about renting a car is that you get to properly test drive a car, in our case for two weeks. Papa bear was like a little boy as he was cruising down the highway. He was explaining to me about the 1.6L engine that delivers 178hp at 5700rpm. Additionally, the base model is front wheel drive and the one we are currently driving is an all-wheel-drive model. It also features a 15.5-gallon gas tank and delivers a fuel consumption of 22/29mpg.<br /><br /> He was carrying on like a dedicated car salesman. I smiled and made an hmm sound while I smiled and nodded at all the appropriate spaces. I knew this big boy was just like a little boy with a new toy. As they say right, boys and their toys…<br /><br />Meeting the local seagulls<br /><br /> We went to a nice little roadhouse next to the beach for some lunch. We got our order and parked the Escape so that we were overlooking the ocean. We sat outside on the rocks. Such a nice view as the waves broke and the wind gently sprayed us with ocean mist.<br /><br /> No 2 was holding a fry out of the window as he stared across the ocean when suddenly something grabbed the fry out of his hand. He screamed like a little girl! <br /><br /> A seagull took advantage of the hypnotic effect of the ocean and before we knew it we were surrounded by fry-stealing seagulls coming from who knows where.<br /><br /> Suddenly, we knew what it felt like to be surrounded.<br /><br /> The kids freely gave up the last of their fries in fear of seagull stares going mafia on us or being bitten. This, we took as our queue to get moving again.<br /><br />The Escape<br /><br /> The rest of our trip ran smoothly even though we had two nights of extreme mozzy (miskito, the insect kind) attacks, we knew all was fine. Everyone had their injections and no viruses were going to make us ill.<br /><br /> We enjoyed BBQ’s in the sunset overlooking the ocean and playing in the sand. We even got the opportunity to see some crabs and dolphins.<br /><br /> The thing I loved about the Escape, the SUV, is the large back seat, the kids had a ball, with plenty of space for themselves. The front seemed a bit smaller than with other SUV’s I’ve seen but the backseat and the luggage space makes up for it.<br /><br /> Some other small things that also made me like the Escape was the cruise control, backup camera and illuminating vanity mirrors. But the best is the overhead storage compartment, I could really get used to those. I can start to see why Papa Bear had his eye on the Escape. I just wonder does it come in pink?<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br /> The trip was amazing, we loved the Ford Escape and the escape from our busy lives’. The calming effect of the oceans draw refreshed us and we gained new strength to face our lives back home again. We were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br /><br /> How awesome was the fact that we need not drive all those miles back home. We got on an airplane with the refreshing effects of a 2-week ocean holiday still lingering all around us even as we got back home. On top of it all, we were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br />Article last time updated on 12.10.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-10-01 00:00:00	247	m2m
132	60	2	Everything You Should Know About a YAG Capsulotomy Procedure	Yttrium Aluminum Garnet also called YAG, is a procedure that produces infra-red laser light impulses. It is used to create small openings within tissue that are targeted through a process known as photo-disruption. Generally, it’s used for treating the iris and secondary cataracts. Sometimes doctors might also use it in treating problems with the retina at the eye’s back.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Indications<br /><br /> There is a variety of eye conditions treatable with this procedure. Conditions of the eyes that can be treated with a YAG capsulotomy procedure may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    If there are vision interferences with activities during the day.<br /><br /> •    When vision in patients decreases that have multifocal intraocular lenses that might specifically be sensitive to even tiny changes of the posterior capsular.<br /><br /> •    Increased glaring.<br /><br /> •    Difficulty to visualize the fundus.<br /><br /> •    With Z syndrome and lens tilting that is related to hinge compliant lenses, like the Trulign toric and Crystalens lenses. Z syndrome may occur if one hap tic arched posterior and the other anterior, and lens tilting can occur if one hap tic is arched either posterior or anterior and the other is planar.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In some cases, it’s possible for a tiny anterior capsular contraction, capsulorrhexis or capsular phimosis may occur. With such excessive anterior scarring to your intra-ocular lens, it might compromise your vision. Alleviation by anterior radial capsulotomies will be achieved through YAG laser treatment.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> About the procedure<br /><br /> To remove the haze capsule is a minor procedure that only requires dilation of your eye.<br /><br /> The doctor will numb your eye’s front by using special eye drops, after which he/she places a tiny contact lens on the eye. Then your head needs to rest on the YAG laser machine’s frame so that your doctor can focus the laser onto the capsule.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Small holes will be made by this laser into the capsule, in such a pattern which allows the doctor to determine what can be the best treatment for your specific condition.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Because there isn’t any incision required, you won’t feel pain or be at risk to develop infections. However, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drops for your eyes after the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Benefits of YAG capsulotomy procedures<br /><br /> •    The treatment is basically pain-free.<br /><br /> •    There isn’t any risk to get an infection.<br /><br /> •    It’s an outpatient treatment procedure.<br /><br /> •    Less healing time and trauma for your eye.<br /><br /> •    The procedure only lasts for a few minutes, though you might have to stay between one and two hours.<br /><br /> •    Reduced cost.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Recovery after the procedure<br /><br /> After the procedure, you can immediately resume normal activities and expect improvement of your vision within one day. Yet, you might experience some degree of floaters for a couple of weeks following the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> At the completion of the procedure, it’s important after a week to go back for a follow-up so that your doctor can examine the overall results, vision, and pressure. You should only as a precaution each day after your procedure tests your eye sight. Do this by closing your eye which hasn't had the surgery, and checks your eye’s vision.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Every year following the treatment you need to go for a checkup of your eyes. This is done to check for any other problems, as well as glaucoma because if your eye is just slightly unusual, examinations are critical.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Any possible risks to a YAG Capsulotomy procedure<br /><br /> Serious problems are very rare in a posterior YAG capsulotomy because it’s an extremely effective and safe procedure. However, the same as with any type of medical procedure, there might be some degree of risks involved.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The one that is very common may be the pressure that rises within your eye. When this happens the doctor can prescribe some eye drops, or maybe some combination of drops and tablets for reducing this pressure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A risk that might be a bit higher can be the detachment of your retina, as well as swelling of your macula. Nonetheless, both of these risks are quite rare, if your original surgery for cataracts with laser treatment was performed over six months earlier.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> By consulting an experienced professional eye specialist for this procedure, it may minimize your risks significantly involving posterior YAG capsulotomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Once your doctor and you decided that a posterior YAG capsulotomy will be the right choice for you, the doctor can provide you with extra information to allow you in making an informed decision of whether you want to proceed. Make sure that all questions you may have are answered to your full satisfaction.<br />Article last time updated on 24.08.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-08-24 00:00:00	365	m2m
133	60	2	Hysterectomy Types and Complications	What is a Hysterectomy and why is it performed?<br /><br /><br /><br /> A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that consists of removing the uterus. The uterus of a woman may cause pain due to a medical issue. In this case, a doctor or gynecologist can examine the uterus and run some tests to see what the issue is. If it cannot be cured, the uterus may be removed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The most common reasons a woman needs to undergo a hysterectomy procedure are as follow:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Uterine fibroids,<br /><br /> •    Endometriosis,<br /><br /> •    Adenomyosis,<br /><br /> •    Abnormal vaginal bleeding,<br /><br /> •    Chronic pelvic pain,<br /><br /> •    Pelvic inflammatory disease,<br /><br /> •    Cervical dysplasia,<br /><br /> •    Cervical cancer,<br /><br /> •    Uterine cancer,<br /><br /> •    Ovarian cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy types<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Today, there are different surgical techniques used for performing a hysterectomy when needed, such as:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Vaginal hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed through the vagina. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of endometrial hyperplasia, cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Total abdominal hysterectomy – is the most common type of hysterectomy performed among women worldwide. This surgical procedure consists of a total removal of the uterus including the cervix. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of ovary cancer, uterine cancer, large uterine fibroids, endometriosis, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Supracervical hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed but the cervix is spared. A supracervical hysterectomy is recommended in cases when there is no medical indication for removing the cervix. However, later in life, there is always the possibility of cancer development in this part of the cervix that has not been surgically removed at the same time as the uterus.  This type of hysterectomy decreases the risk of vaginal prolapse as it provides some kind of support for the vagina.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopy – assisted vaginal hysterectomy – is a similar surgical procedure to the vaginal hysterectomy, but includes the use of a laparoscope. During this procedure, the upper part of the abdomen is carefully inspected when needed. Such as in cases when the removal of the ovaries is planned as well, or in cases of early stages of endometrial cancer.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy – is similar to laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Though, the difference between these two surgical procedures consists of the fact that in laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy the uterus is separated from the cervix and later removed through a laparoscopic incision. The cervix is preserved in this type of surgery. Thus, the recovery period is faster.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Radical hysterectomy – is an extensive type of surgery usually performed in cases where early stages of cervical cancer are noted. This surgical procedure consists of not only removing the uterus and the cervix but also removing the upper part of the vagina and the surrounding tissues as well. There is a great possibility of a urinary system injury, as well as a bowel injury.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Oophorectomy and scalping - oophorectomy is a surgical procedure which consists of the removal of the ovaries in cases of oophorectomy. In the case of scalping - oophorectomy the adjacent Fallopian tubes are removed as well. These two surgical procedures combined with hysterectomy are performed in cases of ovarian cancer, Fallopian tube cancer, uterine cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy Complications<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Just like any surgical procedure, a hysterectomy has its own risks and possible complications. However, in most of the cases, women do not have any complications at all after this surgical procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> According to different studies, vaginal hysterectomies are linked with fewer risks and complications when compared to abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomies. The more radical the surgical procedure is the greater is the possibility of various risks and complications following hysterectomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Also, the recovery period is shorter in cases of vaginal hysterectomy, when compared to laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomies. Hysterectomy risks and complications greatly depend upon the type of hysterectomy procedure performed, as well as, the overall health of the women undergoing the surgery.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Common risks and complications following a hysterectomy regarding of its type include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Blood clots,<br /><br /> •    Heavy blood loss,<br /><br /> •    Bladder injury,<br /><br /> •    Bowel injury,<br /><br /> •    Infection,<br /><br /> •    Adhesions in the pelvic area,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Weakness of the pelvic muscles and ligaments which normally support the vagina, rectum and the bladder,<br /><br /> •    Difficulties urinating,<br /><br /> •    Early menopause,<br /><br /> •    Anesthesia problems, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Recovering after hysterectomy<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Even though a hysterectomy is a safe surgical procedure, it is often associated with various risks and complications. In general, hospitalization for a couple of days and sometimes weeks following the surgery is required. It only depends on the overall health of the patient and the reason why this procedure is performed in the first place. The recovery period will also depend on the type of hysterectomy performed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In cases of vaginal hysterectomy, the recovery period is faster compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, and even longer for an abdominal hysterectomy. After a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, women should be able to return to their normal daily routines within three to four weeks. In cases of abdominal hysterectomy, the recovery period will take a little bit longer, about four to six weeks.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> However, for a certain period of time after the surgery lifting heavy things, pushing or pulling objects, bending and even sexual intercourse should be avoided.<br />Article last time updated on 23.08.2017.

134	61	2	Cervical Biopsy And Pregnancy	There are many discussions about the cervical biopsy during pregnancy. Usually this type of diagnostics is appointed by gynecologists only on serious reason. This reason is the suspicion on some oncology disease in a patient. The tissues of the uterus must undergo a thorough analysis to determine the clinical picture. There is a popular meaning among doctors that only women who have already gone through labor may undergo it and certainly, it is forbidden to the patients expecting a baby.<br /><br /> A pregnant women undergoes plenty of different analyses. Among them are those which are necessary for every pregnant woman and some individual ones in case if the doctor has suspicions. The cervical biopsy is appointed if there are reasons to think about some pathological processes in the uterus. Still, it is rather an unwanted procedure during the pregnancy.<br /><br /> How does the cervical biopsy perform? The cervix is forced to protrude and it is actually traumatized by taking the examples of tissues for the examination. Of course, the uterus will react on this traumatization. It will constrict and there is a big chance of the pregnancy miscarriage.<br /><br /> However, sometimes the reasons for this appointment are quite serious. If there is a cancer diagnosed, sometimes it is required to get rid of the pregnancy to save a woman’s life. Nevertheless, if the situation is not that dangerous, it is better to start treatment after the labor. The earlier stages of cancer usually allows a woman to carry the pregnancy and undergo labor.<br /><br /> If there is an appointment of cervical biopsy in a pregnant woman, perhaps there can be the other way. It will be better to consult some more specialists or undergo additional analyses. If the reason is erosion or dysplasia, there is no emergency in doing biopsy. It can wait until the labor. Sometimes erosion just passes after it, so do not hurry with decisions.<br />Article last time updated on 04.01.2018.	Amelia Grant	2018-01-03 00:00:00	170	m2m
135	61	2	Teeth Sensitivity In Children	If adults suffer from sensitive teeth very much, imagine how terrible this feeling for children is. If the adult can verbalize his complaints and give a clue about the pain’s localization, with children it is not that simple. A child hardly can explain the character of the tooth pain. It is very difficult to know whether it is the increased sensitivity or something else. The only information parents usually receive is an abstract teeth pain while eating or brushing. Therefore, the reason cannot be clearly determined without visit to dentist. <br /><br />  <br /><br />There is a list of main factors provoking the increased sensitivity of kid’s teeth.<br /><br />1.       Caries. If a child’s tooth or several of them became sensitive, it may mean that there are cavities in those teeth. It is one of the most widely spread reasons of such problem in children. <br /><br />2.       Freshly appeared teeth. When primary teeth are lost, the new teeth may bother a child. They have not enough strength to resist the influence of air, sour and cold food.<br /><br />3.       Sinusitis. It seems that there is no connection between teeth sensitivity and sinus problems. However, it is a tendency of these two diseases often going together. <br /><br />4.       Filling material. If a child’s teeth were restored with the usage of silver amalgam, they can become sensitive afterwards. It is connected with high thermal conductivity qualities of this material.<br /><br />5.       Enamel fractures. They occur not only in adults. If a child has problems with occlusion or bruxism, tiny fractures can appear on his teeth and bring him much discomfort. Especially they are painful during eating.<br /><br />6.       Wrong cleaning technique. It is not a widely spread reason of teeth sensitivity in children but still there is such chance. If a child brushes his teeth too aggressively, he can traumatize a gum and an enamel of teeth. That is why teaching children proper techniques of mouth hygiene from the earliest age is very important.<br /> Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-26 00:00:00	164	m2m
136	61	2	3D-Layering in Cosmetic Dentistry	We live in an era of astonishing scientific and technological progress. The technologies are improving faster than we could ever believe it possible. The progress touches all the spheres of our living including healthcare. The newest scientific achievements are making the process of treatment more effective, convenient and fast. It is especially important for dentistry service that is to improve not only the existing mouth health problems but the aesthetic ones too. The 3D-technologies are here to make a revolution in the cosmetic dentistry.<br /><br /> Let us take a front tooth fracture for an example. It is quite a common thing in childish age. As a rule, the problem occurs because of the tooth trauma. The traditional strategy of treatment in such cases is adhesive restoration of the tooth. It is very difficult to match the color of the composite perfectly to the natural color of the patient’s teeth. 3D technologies allow the convenient and effective process of the color selection with usage of the innovational composite materials.<br /><br /> The model of a tooth that needs to be restored is printed on 3D-printer and doubled with the use of the special form for the individual scheme of shades. The special computer program helps with that. The shades of enamel and dentine are determined before the restoration of the tooth and creating an individual shade scheme. The special SpectroShade device determines the exact shade needed and the thickness of enamel and dentin.<br /><br /> The i3D- technology fully reconstructs the 3D-structure of the real tooth. Materials allows to be corrected within the limits of a certain thickness. Some additional effects allow being placed between the dentin and enamel if necessary. As a final part of the restoration, the material is applied layer by layer. The i3D layering technique  is proven to be a perspective for the further innovations in the field of composite materials’ production.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.

137	61	2	Nuvaring: Pros And Cons	Nuvaring is one of the innovational method of contraception. It has hormonal action but does not come in the form of pills. It is a hypoallergenic hormonal ring that is inserted into a woman’s vagina. The ring is elastic and when inserted into a woman’s body, repeats the shape of her inside.  It contains micro doses of such hormones as estrogen and progestagen that prevent pregnancy. It is a monophasic combined contraceptive method that is inserted by woman herself in one of the first five days of menstrual period.<br /><br />How does Nuvaring work? Under the influence of the temperature of a woman’s body, a ring extracts little doses of hormones every day. They get straight into the ovaries and uterus and interfere with the ovulation process.  This process does not involve the endocrine system because the hormones are getting into a woman’s sex organs at once. That is why Nuvaring does not give a woman many of the side effects going together with oral contraceptives.<br /><br /> The undoubted advantages of the Nuvaring use are:<br /><br /> It does not interfere with sexual intercourse and has no influence on the both partners’ feelings.<br /><br /> It is inserted once a month. A woman does not have to bother herself with remembering to take the pill by schedule.<br /><br /> It does not influence a woman’s way of life. She can do sports and lead an active life without even a feeling of something foreign inside her.<br /><br /> It has quite a good percentage of effectiveness – 99, 9%.<br /><br /> It is available to purchase in many places.<br /><br /> But it also has its drawbacks:<br /><br />  There is quite a big list of contraindications. Among them are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, gynecological diseases, kidney diseases.<br /><br />  It does not provide any STD prevention.<br /><br />  A woman must not use it while breastfeeding.<br /><br />  The price of Nuvaring is rather high.<br /><br /> It also has its certain side effects. Among them are headache, dizziness and even vomiting, allergic reaction and vaginitis. Sometimes the individual specialties of a woman’s organism do not allow her using Nuvaring, so the full diagnostic of organism before choosing it is recommended.<br />Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.

138	61	2	The Laser Treatment Of Periodontitis	Periodontitis is a severe gum disease that can lead to a loss of teeth. The innovational treatment strategies are constantly improved to cope with it more successfully. Among the newest periodontitis treatment strategies is laser gum surgery. Laser technique can help even in the most neglected cases. How is the treatment of periodontitis possible with the help of laser? The laser optical fiber is inserted into the gum pocket. It coagulates the pathological tissue. The special lighting of the fiber allows controlling the depth of laser penetration. It helps working accurately with tissue not to harm healthy ones.<br /><br /> When the treatment ends, the pocket is left sterile, it closes and does not allow harmful bacteria get in there. If it is the earlier stage of periodontitis, one séance may be enough. If the disease progressed, 2-3 séances are required. They must perform once a week. Different types of laser may be used, the doctor determines which will be better for that individual case.<br /><br /> The advantages of periodontitis laser treatment are obvious. These are:<br /><br />  No blood. During the laser action all the tine vessels are soldered.<br /><br />  No pain. The treatment can perform without any anesthesia. A patient does not feel any  discomfort during the procedure. He can go back to his usual life right after the procedure.<br /><br />  Additional polishing of the tooth root tissues. As the result of treatment a gum sticks tight to the tooth.<br /><br />  A small list of contraindications. Even small children, pregnant women and patients with allergy can undergo the procedure. The treatment with laser does not take much of a patient’s time. It is rather effective, even the first procedure gives good result.<br /><br />  Laser periodontitis treatment does not require any preparations. The procedure is not traumatic and does not require any long recovery. Laser rays destroy any pathological microflora. The procedure guarantees sterility and reduces chances on disease in future.<br /> Article last time updated on 22.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-22 00:00:00	165	m2m
139	61	2	Turner’s Hypoplasia Diagnostics	White spots on baby teeth are not just a cosmetic defect. They may be the sign of the enamel hypoplasia. Enamel hypoplasia means incomplete or defective formation of the teeth enamel organic matrix on the germ stage. Hypoplastic effect damages the tooth surface and shape. In most of the cases, it expresses through the local loss of the tooth enamel. It looks like a single lacuna or a row of them surrounding the tooth horizontally. Those lacunae also can conjoin in one fissure. The other severe form of hypoplasia is hypocalсification of enamel. If hypoplasia is the defective formation of the enamel matrix that causes lack of the tissue, hypocalcification provides enough tissue but of poor quality.<br /><br /> The case of Turner’s hypoplasia means an infection that attacks primary teeth or the germs of constant ones in the period of germ formation. Local infection near the apex or trauma of the primary tooth can touch the constant tooth germ too. If infection occurs in the process of the crown formation, it can lead to a further hypoplasia or hypomineralization of the enamel. Lower bicuspids suffer from Turner’s hypoplasia more often, because constant molars above them are very vulnerable to the infection. Constant central incisors mostly suffer from this disease as the result of primary teeth trauma.<br /><br /> The visual diagnostic of Turner’s hypoplasia is possible because the discoloration and pathological changes of enamel are obvious. The X-ray examination may show the deformation of the apex or root, thus can give the ideas about the provoking factor of the disease. Histological analysis will help determine the deep structural changes of the enamel. The treatment of Turner’s hypoplasia requires a complex approach. According to the results of X-ray, the consequences of the problem (it may be trauma or infection) must undergo correction. The cosmetic defect is to be corrected by applying prostheses (veneers or crowns depending of the amount of enamel and dentin destruction).<br />Article last time updated on 21.12.2017.

140	61	2	Teeth Whitening Strips	Nowadays the domestic methods of teeth whitening gained much popularity. Doctors do not consider them the safest way of manipulations with teeth. However, thanks to the convenience and cheapness, they are widely used by many people. Among them quite popular is the method of teeth whitening stripes. The beauty bloggers are recommending them to people and there is a wide assortment of the stuff available. But is it really that safe and convenient?<br /><br /> Among the side effects of whitening stripes usage are inflammation of the gums and increased teeth sensitivity. This does not stop people who do not want to pay a fortune in a dentistry clinic for the professional procedure. People are attracted by their convenience comparing to whitening mouth guards that are well known as one of the most effective domestic whitening methods. They are very simple in use. Together with the whitening toothpastes, strips are expected to have more effect of teeth color improvement.<br /><br /> How do the whitening strips work? They are made of polyethylene and covered with the hydrogen peroxide. This is the active element that provides teeth whitening. A full set consists of the strips for upper and lower teeth rows. The instruction for their usage is very simple – press them tight to your teeth and leave for a half an hour. It must be done twice a day with an interval of 12 hours. The concentration of the active element varies from 6 to 10 per cent in different products.<br /><br /> Of course, the best way to whiten teeth is to do it in a dentistry clinic under the control of the specialist. However, if you decide to try whitening strips at home, keep the rules of safety while using them. They are quite simple –use the toothpaste for sensitive teeth not to bring them more harm and rinse your mouth after strips usage. This helps washing out the active substance not to let it harm your gums. Choose the strips with the smallest concentration of hydrogen peroxide. And if the problems will not pass or even increase, stop using strips and visit your dentist as soon as you can.<br />Article last time updated on 20.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-20 00:00:00	167	m2m
141	61	2	Sweet Addiction: First Signs Of The Problem	Perhaps, all people in the world like sweets. They are tasty and sometimes it seems impossible to resist the desire to have a doughnut or chocolate cake. It is no big deal to indulge yourself from time to time. However, consuming too much sugar containing products is extremely destructive for a human organism. It can even become a real drug with all the symptoms of addiction – abstinence syndrome, decreasing of the sensitivity and unpleasant side effects.<br /><br /> If you are the person who cannot live without chocolate, cakes or ice-cream, read this carefully. Here is the list of warning signs signalizing that you have a problem.<br /><br />  1. You literally ALWAYS want something sweet. And the more you eat it, the more you want. It works exactly like a drug. Your taste sensors adapt to the sweet taste with time and begin perceiving it weaker. It means that now you need more sweets to feel the same taste as you did before. Sugar provokes a hormonal splash. That is why you feel stronger and more energetic after eating something sweet. And when the level of sugar decreases, a wish to bring it back appears.<br /><br />  2. You feel weak throughout the day. A splash of insulin after eating sugar caused the splash of energy, but it will not last long. Energy is stable when the sugar level in blood is stable. And if it’s shattered, you feel misbalanced. Stable energy comes out of proteins and fiber, not from sugar.<br /><br />  3. The state of your skin is becoming worse. People who are sensitive to hormonal splashes often suffer from acne and rosacea. They visit dermatologists, try different treatment strategies but have no idea about the real reason of their problem.<br /><br />  4. Your mood goes up and down during the day. Sugar rises and falls, you feel energetic, then everything irritates you. Feeling of weakness does not help to be in good mood either.<br /><br />  5. You are gaining weight. Sugar contains many calories but little nutritive values. Insulin overproduction caused by it also provokes weight gain. Sugar consumption may cause insulin resistance that causes serious problems with metabolism.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 19.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-19 00:00:00	184	m2m
142	61	2	3D-Technologies In Osseous Surgery	There are many cases in medicine when a patient needs bone grafting. It may concern not only bone grafting for dental implants that can be successful set up only in case where enough bone tissue volume is present. Also bone impants are used in treating locomotor apparatus diseases and bone reconstructions. Nowadays there are four types of implants used for these purposes. A person can be his own bone donor – the missing bone tissue can be taken from his own body where the amount allows doing this. If there is no such possibility, other people may become bone donors. There are special programs that allows donating your body on such purposes after death.<br /><br /> But the bone tissue grafts can be taken not only from people. The cattle bones can also be used for implantation. They undergo multiple stages of sterilization to fit for human organism perfectly. Also there exist artificial bone grafts, but they are considered to be the least effective among all of them.<br /><br /> Now the scientists are working on the possibility to use 3D-thecnologies in creating the bone grafting materials. In John Hopkins University (USA) the mix of 30% natural de-cellulosed bone and 70% polymer was invented and tested.  3D-printing is known to reproduce the 3D-structures’ exact copies with full similarity on the thinnest levels. They combined bio-degrading plastic with natural sterilized bone and received good results allowing hopeful prognoses for future.<br /><br /> The scientists of Quebec University used 3D-technologies to print experimental mixes that have such important quality as ability to yield. Hard grafts lead to misbalance of jaws’ work and the wit the yielding grafts balancing abilities will be better. It will help avoid the bone resorption process. In addition, the anti-corrosion qualities of the invented mixes are excellent. It is believed to have very good perspectives for the wide usage in traumatology, spine medicine and orthopedics. <br />Article last time updated on 18.12.2017.

143	61	2	Liquid in the knee	Modern medicine is dealing with the plenty of cases when the synovial liquid is gathering inside the knee joint.  If the symptoms of disease are ignored and the measures aren’t taken, it can become a reason of the motor dysfunction. Synovial surface surrounds the bone joint and muscle tendon in the knee and serves to limit the mobility of this connection and to protect it from possible damage. The epithelial cells of this surface’s inner layer produce special liquid that serves to lubricate the gristles contacting while performing the process of movement and protecting them from being damaged in this process. In addition, it softens some inner strikes on the knee.<br /><br /> Why does this liquid begun to gather inside the knee? The reason is an inflammation process in the synovial surface. The reasons of it can be various. Among the most wide-spread of them are:<br /><br />  Aseptic inflammation. This type of inflammation does not appear because of any pathogenic bacteria or purulent extractions. It may occur because of the knee trauma or become a complication after some viral infection while overcooling the knee. Sometimes it can be caused by gathering of the metabolism products in the knee.<br /><br />  Purulent inflammation. It is a result of getting of the pathogenic microorganisms into the knee and their multiplication. Often it occurs after the heavy traumas of the knee.<br /><br />  Immunity inflammation. It happens because of the excessive extraction of synovial liquid. Pathological immunity complexes damage the epithelium.<br /><br /> What are the main symptoms of liquid in a patient’s knee?<br /><br />  The increasing of the knee size.<br /><br />  Bound motor function – feeling difficulties during the attempts of bending the knee.<br /><br />  An intumescence on the knee that feels elastic and stiff.<br /><br />  Knee pain during the movements.<br /><br />  Reddening of the skin or feeling it hot.<br /><br /> The different types of inflammations require different ways of treatment.  Knee pain doctor will perform the diagnostic, determine the etymology of disease and appoint the suitable treatment strategy. Sometimes the disease can be treated without medication, for example, with the help of physical therapy Brooklyn. Influence of cold or hot temperature will have positive influence on the knee.<br />Article last time updated on 14.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-14 00:00:00	175	m2m
144	62	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	623	m2m
145	64	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

146	64	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

147	64	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene.

150	68	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

151	68	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

152	68	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

154	69	2	Dental Visit Frequency Equals a Healthy and Happy Smile	Finding a reputed dentist near you is not enough. It’s important to ensure that you and your family should have a fantastic oral health. Your teeth are precious to maintain a healthy smile and taking care of your teeth means visiting the dentist regularly. Between the dental examinations you would need to take care of your teeth quite well. The question arises how often should you visit a dentist?  <br /><br />Dental visit frequency: <br /><br />For professional cleaning of your gums and teeth you must visit a dentist twice a year.

155	69	2	Taking good care of our teeth	Taking good care of our teeth is hygienic. The mouth is actually home to thousands of harmful bacteria and if you do not have your teeth cleaned and checked professionally, you could be prone to oral bacteria-related illnesses.  Many people think that brushing their teeth is enough.<br /><br />Unfortunately, health experts believe that a person should visit a dentist at least twice a year to get their teeth cleaned professionally and checked as well for repair works.  This will ensure that all cavities are removed, and tooth decay is prevented.<br /><br />Despite the importance of going to the dentist, there are still many people who avoid going to the dentist.  These people maybe suffering from fear of the dentist.  Although it may sound a bit funny, majority of these people are full-grown adults.  When asked why they are afraid of dentists, they would probably not know the reason why.  Their fear stems from an illogical belief that a trip to the dentist would mean hours of discomfort and pain.<br /><br />This belief can be blamed on the bad reputations that dentists have earned during the old times.  But there is nothing to fear from dentists today.  These Snoqualmie dentists are well-trained and use the latest technology.  A trip to the dentist is actually comfortable and pain-free.<br /><br /> Your fear of the dentist can be overcome by going to the dentist Snoqualmie and seeing for yourself how times have changed.  Look for a dentist that you will feel comfortable with; if you want you can also ask your friends and colleagues for referrals if you want to look for great dentists.<br /><br />Deciding to go to the dentist is a big step for you.

156	69	2	Healthcare Licensing & Data Solutions	It is a huge task for healthcare organizations to manually monitor employee’s license and certification status. The manual system could lead to serious implications, especially when the monitoring program fails to detect the requirements, newly sanctioned individuals, or even the renewal dates for employees.This could result in an organization falling out of compliance with regulators and receiving fines and penalties, or even experiencing a shortage of staff due to many unlicensed individual employees.<br /><br /><br /><br />Since licensing data has become a big issue in the industry, the leading healthcare organizations are now moving away from monitoring licensing renewals manually, in order to protect themselves against employing sanctioned or unlicensed individuals. They are now adopting the the automated and integrated medical license data monitoring solutions which can help them maintain compliance, and also have a solution to the provision of continual coverage throughout the year. Companies like MedPro Systems have requirements for the bulk HCP license validation that will give your organization solutions for license monitoring.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Automated License Tracking Tool<br /><br />This tracking tool will help you in the process of monitoring the issues of employee’s license. With this automated system, all the current information concerning the licenses are consolidated in one place and can be easily accessed on demand. This helps the human resource employees receive automated notifications in case they need to resolve any licensing issue, as compared to relying on memory or manual calendars.<br /><br />                                                   <br /><br />The Advanced-notice Renewal Alerts<br /><br />It’s a good idea to look for a monitoring system that will automatically notify the administrator at weekly or monthly intervals, reminding them of renewal deadlines. Sending a reminder in advance will give the staff members enough time to acquire all their continuing education and exam requirements, which will help in keeping the compliance of the organization.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Detailed Requirements<br /><br />One of the advantages of an automated system is that it can store particularly detailed information about any tests or the continuing education credits that are required for renewing the license of an individual employee. As a monitoring system, it can also keep the detailed step-by-step license renewal instructions, and even the contact information of the licensing and testing authorities. This makes it easy to share requirements and renewal steps with the staff of your health organization, and avoids putting the organization at risk, which may come as a result of not doing an employee’s renewal on time.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Historical Views and Reports<br /><br />A system that provides historical views and reports about all the licensing work that has been completed for each employee, is incredibly beneficial for just about any organization. It helps the human resource office, and the administrators in observing how the license monitoring program is working. They can use this data to make vital changes to workflow. Also, in the event of auditing, the reports and historical views can help in providing a trail of monitoring actions to federal regulators.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The above are the healthcare licensing data solutions that the leading organizations have currently adopted so as to avoid the serious issues of compliance, and stay ahead of federal regulations.<br />Article last time updated on 01.03.2018.

157	69	2	Fascinating discoveries made through DNA testing	DNA, the molecule of inheritance, carries a set of instructions and is thought to be the most ground-breaking scientific discovery of our time. But what exactly have we learnt from DNA testing?<br /><br />Basic principles of genetics<br /><br /> The first person to write a paper on the way characteristics are passed down through generations was an unknown Augutinian monk. While today, he is considered by many the father of genetics, at the time it took three decades for this paper to the taken seriously.<br /><br /> Between 1856 and 1863, Gregor Mendel conducted experiments on pea plants and attempted to crossbreed. He discovered when a yellow pea plant and a green pea plant were bred together, each time their offspring was yellow. However, this plants offspring were often green, in a ratio of 3:1. From this, Mendel coined the terms ‘recessive’ and ‘dominant’traits, calling the green trait in this example recessive and the yellow trait dominant.<br /><br />The first time DNA was used in a criminal investigation<br /><br /> The very first time DNA was used to aid a criminal investigating was in 1986 by molecular biologist Professor Jeffreys. Using DNA fingerpritining techniques, Jeffreys was able to link semen samples collected from two rape-murders in the midlands of England. He used DNA to verify the confession of a 17-year-old boy and prove he was not in fact the murderer. The attacker, Colin Pitchfork, was linked to both crimes and eventually caught using DNA testing.<br /><br /> The technique used today is a development of this original method because although the original method used by Professor Jeffreys was accurate, it required a large amount of high quality DNA. The techniques used today were developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<br /><br />Ancient mysteries solved<br /><br /> Today, DNA testing is still solving countless ancient mysteries. One famous example is the discovery of Richard III’s body buried under a parking lot in Leicester. His remains showed battle wounds and scoliosis, suggesting the body could be the king’s who died in battle in 1485 and was thought to have had scoliosis, a condition that causes curvature of the spine. However, scientists couldn’t say for certain who’s body it was until DNA was extracted from the bones. This DNA was matched to Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of the king’s sister. This amazing discovery was made possible because if stored in a cold, dry and dark place, DNA can last for thousands of years.<br /><br />Better understanding of inherited diseases<br /><br /> Before scientists understood DNA, inherited diseases remained a mystery to them. It wasn’t until 1902 that Sir Archibald Edward Garrod linked inheritance and disease. Many genetic diseases are still incurable, but increased understanding means we can predict them and we are one step closer to successfully treating them and finding a cure.<br /><br />Reunited families<br /><br />Paternity testing can now determine if a man is the father of a child beyond reasonable doubt. Countless people have now been reunited with their fathers as well as other family members. DNA testing now plays an important role in legal proceedings, especially in relation to child custody cases.<br />Article last time updated on 14.11.2017.	Mary  James	2017-11-13 00:00:00	198	m2m

159	69	2	Eight Ways To Avoid Fibromyalgia	The National Fibromyalgia Association reports that approximately 10 million Americans currently suffer from fibromyalgi , a painful chronic condition. Although this condition is prevalent in women, it can also occur in children and men. <br /><br /> Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that causes widespread body pain, moderate to extreme fatigue, sensitivity to light, sound and touch, sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties. In addition to these symptoms, patients may experience overlapping symptoms from chronic conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, arthritis and lupus. Let's take a look at each of these symptoms, the causes of fibromyalgia and what you can do to avoid it.<br /><br />The symptoms of fibromyalgia<br /><br />Pain – The pain experienced by a fibromyalgia sufferer migrates throughout the body and may vary in intensity. It can be described as throbbing, twitching, shooting or stabbing pain, along with deep muscular aching. Sufferers may also experience burning, numbness or tingling. This pain is often worse in the morning.<br /><br />Fatigue – Fatigue from fibromyalgia is all encompassing and can interfere with a patient's day to day activities. This type of fatigue is more than being tired. Patients report that this fatigue is profound exhaustion that is not relieved with rest.<br /><br />Sleep difficulties – Fibromyalgia sufferers often experience abnormalities in stage 4 deep sleep, which can disrupt sleep patterns and prevent sufferers from receiving deep, restorative and restful sleep. When the sufferer does not sleep, it can increase fatigue levels, pain and cognitive difficulties.<br /><br />Overlapping symptoms – There are many symptoms that can overlap other disorders. These include migraines, restless leg syndrome, skin sensitivities, dry mouth, dry eyes, depression, tinnitus, vision problems, neurological symptoms, decreased coordination, Raynaud's Syndrome and concentration difficulties. Fibromyalgia sufferers may also experience bladder issues and irritable bowel syndrome.<br /><br />Causes of fibromyalgia<br /><br /> Fibromyalgia is difficult to diagnose because patients experience widespread pain and other symptoms. Although there is no definitive blood test that can be done to diagnose this condition, a physician may use a number of tests to rule out other conditions. The physician will perform a tender point exam that measures a patient's pain and tenderness. These tender points  include the arms, neck, chest, around the waist, below the buttocks and near the knees. These tender points are in areas around the joints but not the joints themselves and are located just under the surface of the skin.<br /><br /> There is no definitive cause for fibromyalgia; however, it has been linked with the following risk factors – food sensitivities, chemical allergies, genetics, viruses, poor digestion, stress, neurotransmitter deficiencies, Candida overgrowth, spinal misalignments and hormonal imbalances. Furthermore, those with other chronic autoimmune disorder like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis are at an increased risk of developing fibromyalgia.<br /><br />Avoiding fibromyalgia<br /><br /> The traditional treatment protocols for fibromyalgia include pain relievers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants and anti-seizure medications. These medications do not cure fibromyalgia and can cause serious side effects including ulcers, high blood pressure, allergic reactions, liver failure, decreased immunity and heart attack. Luckily, you can use a multifaceted natural approach to improve your symptoms. <br /><br />Diet – Many sufferers have found that eliminating gluten from their diet can relieve many of the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Additionally, limiting the amount of caffeine you consume can decrease insomnia, depression, muscle tremors and anxiety. Artificial sweeteners, colors and preservatives should also be avoided as they contain compounds that have been linked to memory loss, seizure, thyroid conditions and cancer. Instead, eating a diet of lean proteins, fermented foods, organic fruits and vegetables and raw dairy can help ensure you are receiving the nutrition the body needs.<br /><br />Nutritional supplements – Fibromyalgia sufferers often have nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid and magnesium. Taking a multivitamin and mineral supplement may help relieve many of these symptoms.<br /><br />Stress relief – Stress relief practices like meditation, guided imagery, yoga and deep breathing exercises can help balance hormones, relieve stress and reduce anxiety and depression. Acupuncture, manual lymph drainage therapy, massage and essential oils can also normalize hormones, reduce toxins in the blood, improve circulation, reduce anxiety and improve sleep patterns. Sleep hygiene – If you suffer from insomnia or other sleep difficulties, learning sleep hygiene practices that include a regular bedtime, lowering the bedroom temperature, avoiding caffeine after 6pm and developing a bedtime ritual can help you relax and get ready for bed.<br /><br />Exercise – Many sufferers think they should avoid exercise because they are exhausted and in pain. However, moderate exercise like yoga, Pilates, swimming, biking and walking can help to decrease your pain levels and stress.<br /><br />Chiropractic Care – Because spinal misalignments can increase your risk of developing fibromyalgia, routine chiropractic care  appointments can help you avoid fibromyalgia. Furthermore, studies have shown that chiropractic adjustments can decrease pain, improve fatigue, balance hormones and improve sleep quality.<br /><br />Seek Help – Connecting with others can help you avoid flare-ups and decrease the pain and fatigue when a flare-up occurs. Talking with someone who cares about you can reduce stress, improve your mood and your memory.<br /><br />Hobbies – When you suffer from chronic pain, you can easily become frustrated and stressed. Enjoying a hobby can help you relax and find beauty around you. Creativity bolsters happiness and gives you pleasure.<br /><br /> There are many things you can do to help avoid fibromyalgia flare-ups. First, ensure you are getting enough sleep so that the body and mind can heal itself. Reduce stress using stress relief techniques like meditation, acupuncture and deep breathing exercises. Finally, regular exercise and a balanced diet can help decrease stress and regulate hormones.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 15.08.2017.	Mary  James	2017-08-14 00:00:00	418	m2m
160	69	2	When going to the cinema is just as painless as the dentist	Hands up everyone who has avoided going to the dentist because they were worried about the pain that they were going to have to experience? If we are right, then that is pretty much everyone. It is hard to find someone who has not avoided seeing a medical professional because they are worried about what they may say, but it is only dentists that people worry about what they may do! The years of fillings that people have experienced, the horror stories that they have heard from other people hearing the drill going right by their ear, and the pain and agony that people feel afterwards . . . that is more than enough to convince most people that they are better off staying at home rather than going to a dentist for help.<br /><br /> The idea that you could experience painless fillings and tooth restorations is just unheard of, and even many dentists do not believe that it is possible! However, there are a small number of dentists who have access to a very new type of technology and treatment that is starting to challenge the way that we think about dentists, fillings, and pain. They are developing different ways to treat their patients that do not compromise on the quality of care that they receive, but at the same time does not give their patients such a headache and such agony that they have typically been experiencing. In fact, it is believed by some dentists that in a few months, not years, it will be possible to go to the dentist to have a filling and it be just as painless as going to the cinema.<br /><br /> This is truly revolutionary stuff, and many of them are starting to pull this off. It is a remarkable bit of research and development and offering painless fillings and tooth restorations to patients is starting to become a natural thing at these dental practices, rather than something strange and bizarre. We are here to witness a true change in the way that dentistry works and operates, and what is strange is that most people have absolutely no idea that this is happening. That means that they are not asking their dentists about painless fillings and tooth restorations and so they have having to endure absolute agony when it comes to having their treatment – and only because they are not aware of being able to ask for an alternative!<br /><br /> The dentists who are pioneering painless fillings and tooth restorations are not shouting about this either, but for a very different reason: they are already so overwhelmed with patients who do not want to undergo agony and would rather than a completely painless filling that they simply do not have enough space on their books to fit on more patients! It is a bizarre thought, especially for most dentists who are desperate to be able to find new patients that they can encourage to come to their dental clinic, but that is the power of the painless filling. Many people are happy to pay extra for the lack of pain, and this means that dentists who offer this sort of treatment are completely inundated with patients and see no need to advertise the reason that they are so popular!<br /><br /> If you are a person who has desperately avoided going to see a dentist for a very long time because you have been worried about getting a painful filling then now is the time to start talking to your dentist about painless fillings and tooth restorations and whether that is something that they can offer you.  <br /><br /> Related article: http://wisdomtoothpain.org<br />Article last time updated on 07.07.2017.

161	69	2	Hollywood health fads – are they worth it?	One of the most fascinating things that you can do is to watch Hollywood. No, not the films that they produce – although many of them are truly outstanding and very impressive. No, we mean the people themselves. The people that make up Hollywood. It is almost impossible to avoid them in many cases because they have their lives splashed across newspapers and studied in magazines, but if you start to pay close attention you can start to realize something that may surprise you: almost every single thing that you believe is popular because it is good for you, or cheap, or clever, is not actually popular because of that reason at all. It is all because someone in Hollywood tried it and loved it first, and then it starts to spread like wildfire.<br /><br /> It is a little depressing after a while, because it is astonishing just how many things start off as a Hollywood fad and then very quickly make that transition to general and worldwide popularity before you even know it. You would like to think many of our health fads in particular come from someone who really has expertise in the matter – perhaps a doctor or a dentist, or some other kind of health professional. But believe it or not, most of the time the reason that you brush your teeth with that particular kind of toothpaste or do that kind of yoga every morning for flexibility is not because it has been recommended by someone who has a medical degree. It is because someone in Hollywood has been doing it, the newspaper realized and started talking about it, and now everyone thinks it is the best thing since sliced bread!<br /><br /> However, that is not to say that there is not a beneficial side to this. Many health professionals will tell you that it is often very difficult to encourage people to do the right thing for their health and for their bodies, and sometimes the fact that a famous person has been doing it is enough to encourage someone to do the right thing for their body themselves. The ends sometimes justify the means if you are able to encourage someone towards a much better state of health, even if they are only doing it because a famous person does it. This may sound a little patronizing and it is certainly not the first port of call for any health professional, doctor, dentist, or otherwise – but if that is what is needed to ensure that a person is healthy, then it is worth doing.<br /><br /> One great example of this is the holistic dental clinic which is a type of dental practice that probably would never have seen the light of day if celebrities did not start taking their dental health seriously. Unlike a normal dentist a holistic dental clinic considers the body as a whole rather than just focusing on the one part of the body, like the mouth and teeth. By examining the body as a whole, it is possible to gain a greater understanding of why certain things are happening to the patient, things that would have been missed if the entire body was not taken into account. After all, when you go to a doctor they examine every part of you? Why wouldn’t a dentist do the same?<br /><br /> Hollywood may have a lot to answer for in some respects, but in many ways the celebrities there are inadvertently encouraging people to consider their own health, and perhaps to take it a little more seriously than they would have done – and in our minds, that can only be a good thing.<br /><br /> Source: http://brightondentalsd.com<br />Article last time updated on 07.07.2017.

162	69	2	Hollywood and plastic surgery	It is strange to think that fifty years ago, plastic surgery was not something that was expected to happen in Hollywood. All of that changed of course throughout the end of the seventies and into the eighties, and by the nineties it was almost strange if you participated in films and music if you had not had plastic surgery! It has been a troubled relationship, and one that has certainly had its ups and downs over the years as different kinds of plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery have gone in and out of favor, but now many of the people who live and work in the area of Hollywood are starting to take back control, and decide how they want to have plastic surgery on their own terms. So let’s start at the very beginning: why does Hollywood have such a connection to plastic surgery?<br /><br /> The answer to that question is sadly very simple: many people who live in that area work in industries that are only interested in them when they are young – or when they look young. So many starlets that were popular in their teens and twenties used to fall out of favor by the time that they hit their thirties, and the idea that an actor’s career could last into his sixties was just unheard of. Naturally this has changed slightly in today’s modern world, but it is still true that many people are told that they are too old to play a part when actually, for that character, they are exactly the right age! This can prove to be very frustrating for people who are passionate about performing as a career because it seems to cut it short just as they are starting to really get their teeth into the material.<br /><br /> So what are people in Hollywood doing in order to fight back? Well, surprisingly they are not deciding to turn their back on the plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery industry, but they are instead realizing that if you cannot beat them, you can join them! Many are starting to learn to inject botulinum toxins which is a key element of Botox, and by doing so they can set up their own practice and decide who they want to treat, and how. Students who want to learn to inject botulinum toxins can often attend these classes in the evenings or even online so that they do not interfere with their current career paths, and when they have become qualified to be able to give Botox injections, they are then able to increase their streams of income so that they are not completely dependent on the next film coming along.<br /><br /> It is not overtly difficult to learn to inject botulinum toxins, but you do need to be committed to the training as you have to pass certain certification classes. There are more people who live in and around Hollywood right now that can perform Botox and other kinds of plastic surgery than ever before, and this number is just rising and rising. Being able to take back control has become very important to people and there is no knowing what they could do next – perhaps chemical peels, or facelifts are going to become the new learning fashion. All we know is that the strange and delicate relationship that Hollywood has with plastic surgery is not disappearing, just changing, and it is going to be fascinating to see where it goes next. Perhaps you are going to learn to inject botulinum toxins in Hollywood? Let us know all about it in the comments below!<br /><br /> Related: http://dentox.com/all-courses/botox-training<br />Article last time updated on 10.07.2017.

164	71	2	What All Parents Should Know About IVs	By Heather Michon |<br /><br /><br /><br /> Caitlin King only got to hold her newborn twin girls for a few precious moments before they were whisked off to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). That’s where their journey began. Born at 32 weeks and six days, Abbie May and Gardner Grace weighed just four pounds each.<br /><br /> Caitlin describes the NICU as a whirlwind, filled with fragile little babies attended by a team of nurses. “[They were] the most amazing people I’ve ever experienced,” says Caitlin. “The NICU nurses were everything to us.”<br /><br /> She was awakened in the middle of the night by the news that the medical team was having a hard time finding good veins on the girls’ limbs. The nurse requested permission to insert intravenous (IV) lines into their bellybuttons.<br /><br /> The umbilical vein remains viable for about a week after birth and it is sometimes used to take blood samples. Umbilical vein catheterization (UVC) is recommended when good peripheral veins can’t be found, but it does carry risks. Some of the complications include a potential for infection, bleeding from the umbilical vein, and embolism.<br /><br /> Caitlin gave her consent, but was concerned for her daughters. “After the nurse left, I just lost it. I started crying and it just sounded so scary,” she admits.<br /><br /> The umbilical line worked for Gardner Grace, but not for twin sister Abbie May. Staff finally inserted the catheter into a vein in Abbie May’s scalp.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Scalp vein catheterization is even less common than a UVC and most consider it a last resort. In some ways, it’s an excellent location: there are several veins in a newborn’s skull that are easy to visualize and because a baby tends not to move their head the way they move their limbs, the catheter is less likely to be dislodged. Statistically, it seems to carry no greater risk than a line in the arm or the leg. However, it’s avoided when possible because it’s more upsetting for parents, especially since it often requires the area to be shaved and can leave a scar.<br /><br /><br />  Caitlin had previously worked on a project with a medical research company, giving her some familiarity with IVs.  “Every NICU nurse we had, I told them ‘I don’t know anything about medical stuff except IV infiltration. So you have to make sure that my kids’ IVs don’t infiltrate,’” she laughs.<br /><br />  One day, she looked at Abbie May’s scalp and thought the area around the catheter looked puffy–one of the primary signs of infiltration. She called the nurse over to check it, and the nurse agreed that she was also concerned when she looked at it. Examination showed the catheter had infiltrated and was leaking fluid into the surrounding tissue. It was quickly removed. After 15 days in the NICU, the newborns were discharged from the hospital and finally got to go home.<br /><br /><br /><br />  While Caitlin believes the nurse probably would have discovered the infiltration herself, she’s glad she was able to have an active role in her newborns’ care.<br /><br />  “I was pretty proud that I knew there was something wrong and was able to point out to the nurse that it didn’t look right.”<br /><br />  In a situation where she felt powerless, this was something she had done that helped her babies.<br /><br />  It was a boost of confidence in a stressful time. “If, as a parent, I can be aware and say ‘look, I think something’s wrong here,’ and bring attention to something a doctor or nurse may be missing–because they’re human and sometimes we miss things–then I’ll do it.”<br /><br /><br /><br />  Now the mom of two healthy, active three-year-olds, Caitlin hopes other parents take from her experience the importance of educating themselves when it comes to kids and IVs. “There’s no awareness about IVs, it’s not talked about, and yet it happens every day,” she says. “As a parent, feeling helpless is one of the worst feelings in the world. If there’s something you can do when it comes to knowing what to look for, do it.”<br /><br />  Do you have an IV story to share?

165	71	2	IV Complications: What Can Go Wrong?	https://www.myiv.com/iv-complications/<br /><br /> By: Ryan MacArthur <br /><br />Full story:<br /><br /> The use of intravenous (IV) therapy is more common than ever. While it’s an extremely valuable tool for healthcare professionals, patients and providers must know and understand the risks associated with IV therapy.<br /><br /> Infiltrations<br /><br /> The delivery of fluid and/or medication outside the vein and into the surrounding soft tissue. An infiltration can occur for a number of reasons, such as leakage from the insertion site or catheter dislodgement. Patients will see swelling of the soft tissue surrounding the IV, and the skin will feel cool, firm, and pale. Small amounts of IV fluid aren’t typically life-threatening but some medications, even in small doses, can be very toxic to the surrounding soft tissue.<br /><br /> Extravasations<br /><br /> The infiltration of a blistering agent (also known as a vesicant) into the surrounding IV site as the result of leakage from a vein. Vesicants can cause tissue destruction and result in pain at the IV site and along the vein. Because chemotherapy medications are highly toxic, extravasation is especially dangerous.<br /><br /> Hematoma<br /><br /> The leakage of blood from the vein into the surrounding soft tissue. This can occur when an IV angiocatheter goes through more than one wall of a vein or if pressure is not applied to the IV site when the catheter is removed.<br /><br /> Phlebitis and Thrombophlebitis<br /><br /> Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein, while thrombophlebitis refers to inflammation associated with a blood clot within the vascular system. Both are more common on the backside of the hand than on the upper part of the elbow and may occur in hospitalized patients where an IV has been in place for several days.<br /><br /> Air Embolism<br /><br /> A result of a large volume of air entering the patient’s vein via the IV. When an air bubble enters a vein or artery, it can cause life-threatening blockages. In order to prevent air bubbles from forming, clinicians will keep the IV bag from moving and ensure it is it remains hanging vertically.<br /><br /><br />  References:<br /><br />   Everything you need to know about air bubbles in your patient’s IV line https://thenursepath.blog/2016/12/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-air-bubbles-in-your-patients-iv-line/<br /><br />   Know the Difference Between Infiltration vs. Extravasation https://www.rn.com/nursing-news/know-the-difference-infiltration-vs-extravasation/<br /><br />   Air Embolism http://www.healthline.com/health/air-embolism#overview1<br /><br />   Medical Emergencies and Complications http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/aegd/mod01_mec_ivcomp.html<br /><br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 16.01.2018.

167	74	2	Cervical Biopsy And Pregnancy	There are many discussions about the cervical biopsy during pregnancy. Usually this type of diagnostics is appointed by gynecologists only on serious reason. This reason is the suspicion on some oncology disease in a patient. The tissues of the uterus must undergo a thorough analysis to determine the clinical picture. There is a popular meaning among doctors that only women who have already gone through labor may undergo it and certainly, it is forbidden to the patients expecting a baby.<br /><br /> A pregnant women undergoes plenty of different analyses. Among them are those which are necessary for every pregnant woman and some individual ones in case if the doctor has suspicions. The cervical biopsy is appointed if there are reasons to think about some pathological processes in the uterus. Still, it is rather an unwanted procedure during the pregnancy.<br /><br /> How does the cervical biopsy perform? The cervix is forced to protrude and it is actually traumatized by taking the examples of tissues for the examination. Of course, the uterus will react on this traumatization. It will constrict and there is a big chance of the pregnancy miscarriage.<br /><br /> However, sometimes the reasons for this appointment are quite serious. If there is a cancer diagnosed, sometimes it is required to get rid of the pregnancy to save a woman’s life. Nevertheless, if the situation is not that dangerous, it is better to start treatment after the labor. The earlier stages of cancer usually allows a woman to carry the pregnancy and undergo labor.<br /><br /> If there is an appointment of cervical biopsy in a pregnant woman, perhaps there can be the other way. It will be better to consult some more specialists or undergo additional analyses. If the reason is erosion or dysplasia, there is no emergency in doing biopsy. It can wait until the labor. Sometimes erosion just passes after it, so do not hurry with decisions.<br />Article last time updated on 04.01.2018.	Amelia Grant	2018-01-03 00:00:00	170	m2m
168	74	2	Teeth Sensitivity In Children	If adults suffer from sensitive teeth very much, imagine how terrible this feeling for children is. If the adult can verbalize his complaints and give a clue about the pain’s localization, with children it is not that simple. A child hardly can explain the character of the tooth pain. It is very difficult to know whether it is the increased sensitivity or something else. The only information parents usually receive is an abstract teeth pain while eating or brushing. Therefore, the reason cannot be clearly determined without visit to dentist. <br /><br />  <br /><br />There is a list of main factors provoking the increased sensitivity of kid’s teeth.<br /><br />1.       Caries. If a child’s tooth or several of them became sensitive, it may mean that there are cavities in those teeth. It is one of the most widely spread reasons of such problem in children. <br /><br />2.       Freshly appeared teeth. When primary teeth are lost, the new teeth may bother a child. They have not enough strength to resist the influence of air, sour and cold food.<br /><br />3.       Sinusitis. It seems that there is no connection between teeth sensitivity and sinus problems. However, it is a tendency of these two diseases often going together. <br /><br />4.       Filling material. If a child’s teeth were restored with the usage of silver amalgam, they can become sensitive afterwards. It is connected with high thermal conductivity qualities of this material.<br /><br />5.       Enamel fractures. They occur not only in adults. If a child has problems with occlusion or bruxism, tiny fractures can appear on his teeth and bring him much discomfort. Especially they are painful during eating.<br /><br />6.       Wrong cleaning technique. It is not a widely spread reason of teeth sensitivity in children but still there is such chance. If a child brushes his teeth too aggressively, he can traumatize a gum and an enamel of teeth. That is why teaching children proper techniques of mouth hygiene from the earliest age is very important.<br /> Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-26 00:00:00	164	m2m
169	74	2	3D-Layering in Cosmetic Dentistry	We live in an era of astonishing scientific and technological progress. The technologies are improving faster than we could ever believe it possible. The progress touches all the spheres of our living including healthcare. The newest scientific achievements are making the process of treatment more effective, convenient and fast. It is especially important for dentistry service that is to improve not only the existing mouth health problems but the aesthetic ones too. The 3D-technologies are here to make a revolution in the cosmetic dentistry.<br /><br /> Let us take a front tooth fracture for an example. It is quite a common thing in childish age. As a rule, the problem occurs because of the tooth trauma. The traditional strategy of treatment in such cases is adhesive restoration of the tooth. It is very difficult to match the color of the composite perfectly to the natural color of the patient’s teeth. 3D technologies allow the convenient and effective process of the color selection with usage of the innovational composite materials.<br /><br /> The model of a tooth that needs to be restored is printed on 3D-printer and doubled with the use of the special form for the individual scheme of shades. The special computer program helps with that. The shades of enamel and dentine are determined before the restoration of the tooth and creating an individual shade scheme. The special SpectroShade device determines the exact shade needed and the thickness of enamel and dentin.<br /><br /> The i3D- technology fully reconstructs the 3D-structure of the real tooth. Materials allows to be corrected within the limits of a certain thickness. Some additional effects allow being placed between the dentin and enamel if necessary. As a final part of the restoration, the material is applied layer by layer. The i3D layering technique  is proven to be a perspective for the further innovations in the field of composite materials’ production.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.

170	74	2	Nuvaring: Pros And Cons	Nuvaring is one of the innovational method of contraception. It has hormonal action but does not come in the form of pills. It is a hypoallergenic hormonal ring that is inserted into a woman’s vagina. The ring is elastic and when inserted into a woman’s body, repeats the shape of her inside.  It contains micro doses of such hormones as estrogen and progestagen that prevent pregnancy. It is a monophasic combined contraceptive method that is inserted by woman herself in one of the first five days of menstrual period.<br /><br />How does Nuvaring work? Under the influence of the temperature of a woman’s body, a ring extracts little doses of hormones every day. They get straight into the ovaries and uterus and interfere with the ovulation process.  This process does not involve the endocrine system because the hormones are getting into a woman’s sex organs at once. That is why Nuvaring does not give a woman many of the side effects going together with oral contraceptives.<br /><br /> The undoubted advantages of the Nuvaring use are:<br /><br /> It does not interfere with sexual intercourse and has no influence on the both partners’ feelings.<br /><br /> It is inserted once a month. A woman does not have to bother herself with remembering to take the pill by schedule.<br /><br /> It does not influence a woman’s way of life. She can do sports and lead an active life without even a feeling of something foreign inside her.<br /><br /> It has quite a good percentage of effectiveness – 99, 9%.<br /><br /> It is available to purchase in many places.<br /><br /> But it also has its drawbacks:<br /><br />  There is quite a big list of contraindications. Among them are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, gynecological diseases, kidney diseases.<br /><br />  It does not provide any STD prevention.<br /><br />  A woman must not use it while breastfeeding.<br /><br />  The price of Nuvaring is rather high.<br /><br /> It also has its certain side effects. Among them are headache, dizziness and even vomiting, allergic reaction and vaginitis. Sometimes the individual specialties of a woman’s organism do not allow her using Nuvaring, so the full diagnostic of organism before choosing it is recommended.<br />Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.

171	74	2	The Laser Treatment Of Periodontitis	Periodontitis is a severe gum disease that can lead to a loss of teeth. The innovational treatment strategies are constantly improved to cope with it more successfully. Among the newest periodontitis treatment strategies is laser gum surgery. Laser technique can help even in the most neglected cases. How is the treatment of periodontitis possible with the help of laser? The laser optical fiber is inserted into the gum pocket. It coagulates the pathological tissue. The special lighting of the fiber allows controlling the depth of laser penetration. It helps working accurately with tissue not to harm healthy ones.<br /><br /> When the treatment ends, the pocket is left sterile, it closes and does not allow harmful bacteria get in there. If it is the earlier stage of periodontitis, one séance may be enough. If the disease progressed, 2-3 séances are required. They must perform once a week. Different types of laser may be used, the doctor determines which will be better for that individual case.<br /><br /> The advantages of periodontitis laser treatment are obvious. These are:<br /><br />  No blood. During the laser action all the tine vessels are soldered.<br /><br />  No pain. The treatment can perform without any anesthesia. A patient does not feel any  discomfort during the procedure. He can go back to his usual life right after the procedure.<br /><br />  Additional polishing of the tooth root tissues. As the result of treatment a gum sticks tight to the tooth.<br /><br />  A small list of contraindications. Even small children, pregnant women and patients with allergy can undergo the procedure. The treatment with laser does not take much of a patient’s time. It is rather effective, even the first procedure gives good result.<br /><br />  Laser periodontitis treatment does not require any preparations. The procedure is not traumatic and does not require any long recovery. Laser rays destroy any pathological microflora. The procedure guarantees sterility and reduces chances on disease in future.<br /> Article last time updated on 22.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-22 00:00:00	165	m2m
172	74	2	Turner’s Hypoplasia Diagnostics	White spots on baby teeth are not just a cosmetic defect. They may be the sign of the enamel hypoplasia. Enamel hypoplasia means incomplete or defective formation of the teeth enamel organic matrix on the germ stage. Hypoplastic effect damages the tooth surface and shape. In most of the cases, it expresses through the local loss of the tooth enamel. It looks like a single lacuna or a row of them surrounding the tooth horizontally. Those lacunae also can conjoin in one fissure. The other severe form of hypoplasia is hypocalсification of enamel. If hypoplasia is the defective formation of the enamel matrix that causes lack of the tissue, hypocalcification provides enough tissue but of poor quality.<br /><br /> The case of Turner’s hypoplasia means an infection that attacks primary teeth or the germs of constant ones in the period of germ formation. Local infection near the apex or trauma of the primary tooth can touch the constant tooth germ too. If infection occurs in the process of the crown formation, it can lead to a further hypoplasia or hypomineralization of the enamel. Lower bicuspids suffer from Turner’s hypoplasia more often, because constant molars above them are very vulnerable to the infection. Constant central incisors mostly suffer from this disease as the result of primary teeth trauma.<br /><br /> The visual diagnostic of Turner’s hypoplasia is possible because the discoloration and pathological changes of enamel are obvious. The X-ray examination may show the deformation of the apex or root, thus can give the ideas about the provoking factor of the disease. Histological analysis will help determine the deep structural changes of the enamel. The treatment of Turner’s hypoplasia requires a complex approach. According to the results of X-ray, the consequences of the problem (it may be trauma or infection) must undergo correction. The cosmetic defect is to be corrected by applying prostheses (veneers or crowns depending of the amount of enamel and dentin destruction).<br />Article last time updated on 21.12.2017.

173	74	2	Teeth Whitening Strips	Nowadays the domestic methods of teeth whitening gained much popularity. Doctors do not consider them the safest way of manipulations with teeth. However, thanks to the convenience and cheapness, they are widely used by many people. Among them quite popular is the method of teeth whitening stripes. The beauty bloggers are recommending them to people and there is a wide assortment of the stuff available. But is it really that safe and convenient?<br /><br /> Among the side effects of whitening stripes usage are inflammation of the gums and increased teeth sensitivity. This does not stop people who do not want to pay a fortune in a dentistry clinic for the professional procedure. People are attracted by their convenience comparing to whitening mouth guards that are well known as one of the most effective domestic whitening methods. They are very simple in use. Together with the whitening toothpastes, strips are expected to have more effect of teeth color improvement.<br /><br /> How do the whitening strips work? They are made of polyethylene and covered with the hydrogen peroxide. This is the active element that provides teeth whitening. A full set consists of the strips for upper and lower teeth rows. The instruction for their usage is very simple – press them tight to your teeth and leave for a half an hour. It must be done twice a day with an interval of 12 hours. The concentration of the active element varies from 6 to 10 per cent in different products.<br /><br /> Of course, the best way to whiten teeth is to do it in a dentistry clinic under the control of the specialist. However, if you decide to try whitening strips at home, keep the rules of safety while using them. They are quite simple –use the toothpaste for sensitive teeth not to bring them more harm and rinse your mouth after strips usage. This helps washing out the active substance not to let it harm your gums. Choose the strips with the smallest concentration of hydrogen peroxide. And if the problems will not pass or even increase, stop using strips and visit your dentist as soon as you can.<br />Article last time updated on 20.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-20 00:00:00	167	m2m
174	74	2	Sweet Addiction: First Signs Of The Problem	Perhaps, all people in the world like sweets. They are tasty and sometimes it seems impossible to resist the desire to have a doughnut or chocolate cake. It is no big deal to indulge yourself from time to time. However, consuming too much sugar containing products is extremely destructive for a human organism. It can even become a real drug with all the symptoms of addiction – abstinence syndrome, decreasing of the sensitivity and unpleasant side effects.<br /><br /> If you are the person who cannot live without chocolate, cakes or ice-cream, read this carefully. Here is the list of warning signs signalizing that you have a problem.<br /><br />  1. You literally ALWAYS want something sweet. And the more you eat it, the more you want. It works exactly like a drug. Your taste sensors adapt to the sweet taste with time and begin perceiving it weaker. It means that now you need more sweets to feel the same taste as you did before. Sugar provokes a hormonal splash. That is why you feel stronger and more energetic after eating something sweet. And when the level of sugar decreases, a wish to bring it back appears.<br /><br />  2. You feel weak throughout the day. A splash of insulin after eating sugar caused the splash of energy, but it will not last long. Energy is stable when the sugar level in blood is stable. And if it’s shattered, you feel misbalanced. Stable energy comes out of proteins and fiber, not from sugar.<br /><br />  3. The state of your skin is becoming worse. People who are sensitive to hormonal splashes often suffer from acne and rosacea. They visit dermatologists, try different treatment strategies but have no idea about the real reason of their problem.<br /><br />  4. Your mood goes up and down during the day. Sugar rises and falls, you feel energetic, then everything irritates you. Feeling of weakness does not help to be in good mood either.<br /><br />  5. You are gaining weight. Sugar contains many calories but little nutritive values. Insulin overproduction caused by it also provokes weight gain. Sugar consumption may cause insulin resistance that causes serious problems with metabolism.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 19.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-19 00:00:00	187	m2m
175	74	2	3D-Technologies In Osseous Surgery	There are many cases in medicine when a patient needs bone grafting. It may concern not only bone grafting for dental implants that can be successful set up only in case where enough bone tissue volume is present. Also bone impants are used in treating locomotor apparatus diseases and bone reconstructions. Nowadays there are four types of implants used for these purposes. A person can be his own bone donor – the missing bone tissue can be taken from his own body where the amount allows doing this. If there is no such possibility, other people may become bone donors. There are special programs that allows donating your body on such purposes after death.<br /><br /> But the bone tissue grafts can be taken not only from people. The cattle bones can also be used for implantation. They undergo multiple stages of sterilization to fit for human organism perfectly. Also there exist artificial bone grafts, but they are considered to be the least effective among all of them.<br /><br /> Now the scientists are working on the possibility to use 3D-thecnologies in creating the bone grafting materials. In John Hopkins University (USA) the mix of 30% natural de-cellulosed bone and 70% polymer was invented and tested.  3D-printing is known to reproduce the 3D-structures’ exact copies with full similarity on the thinnest levels. They combined bio-degrading plastic with natural sterilized bone and received good results allowing hopeful prognoses for future.<br /><br /> The scientists of Quebec University used 3D-technologies to print experimental mixes that have such important quality as ability to yield. Hard grafts lead to misbalance of jaws’ work and the wit the yielding grafts balancing abilities will be better. It will help avoid the bone resorption process. In addition, the anti-corrosion qualities of the invented mixes are excellent. It is believed to have very good perspectives for the wide usage in traumatology, spine medicine and orthopedics. <br />Article last time updated on 18.12.2017.

176	74	2	Liquid in the knee	Modern medicine is dealing with the plenty of cases when the synovial liquid is gathering inside the knee joint.  If the symptoms of disease are ignored and the measures aren’t taken, it can become a reason of the motor dysfunction. Synovial surface surrounds the bone joint and muscle tendon in the knee and serves to limit the mobility of this connection and to protect it from possible damage. The epithelial cells of this surface’s inner layer produce special liquid that serves to lubricate the gristles contacting while performing the process of movement and protecting them from being damaged in this process. In addition, it softens some inner strikes on the knee.<br /><br /> Why does this liquid begun to gather inside the knee? The reason is an inflammation process in the synovial surface. The reasons of it can be various. Among the most wide-spread of them are:<br /><br />  Aseptic inflammation. This type of inflammation does not appear because of any pathogenic bacteria or purulent extractions. It may occur because of the knee trauma or become a complication after some viral infection while overcooling the knee. Sometimes it can be caused by gathering of the metabolism products in the knee.<br /><br />  Purulent inflammation. It is a result of getting of the pathogenic microorganisms into the knee and their multiplication. Often it occurs after the heavy traumas of the knee.<br /><br />  Immunity inflammation. It happens because of the excessive extraction of synovial liquid. Pathological immunity complexes damage the epithelium.<br /><br /> What are the main symptoms of liquid in a patient’s knee?<br /><br />  The increasing of the knee size.<br /><br />  Bound motor function – feeling difficulties during the attempts of bending the knee.<br /><br />  An intumescence on the knee that feels elastic and stiff.<br /><br />  Knee pain during the movements.<br /><br />  Reddening of the skin or feeling it hot.<br /><br /> The different types of inflammations require different ways of treatment.  Knee pain doctor will perform the diagnostic, determine the etymology of disease and appoint the suitable treatment strategy. Sometimes the disease can be treated without medication, for example, with the help of physical therapy Brooklyn. Influence of cold or hot temperature will have positive influence on the knee.<br />Article last time updated on 14.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-14 00:00:00	175	m2m

Fatty acids can also be taken in the form of food supplements. First of all, it is fish oil in capsules. A rich source of Omega-3 is the fish of fatty varieties inhabiting oceans. These fish products include mackerel, salmon, and tuna. Omega-3 is also found in vegetable oils.<br /><br />The richest source of omega-3 is flaxseed oil. The content of Omega-3 in cold pressed flaxseed oil is 57%. Therefore, probably, this oil is the best brain booster (or one of the best). Sunflower oil does not contain Omega-3 fatty acids. In olive oil, the content of Omega-3 is only 0.6%.<br />Article last time updated on 08.12.2017.	Ann Morgan	2017-12-08 00:00:00	168	m2m

This means if any of their relatives also experienced depression as an illness factor, it will be more likely for a woman to experience it herself.<br /><br /> Specific events in life may trigger depressive episodes. These include such as rape or physical abuse and it can trigger depression that is severe after an abortion as it may cause a feeling of loss and separation.<br /><br /> It’s important for any woman making the choice to go for an abortion, no matter what the reason might be, to consult a professional for help before and after the procedure.

193	80	2	Treatments Used in Dental Habit Therapy That Can Help Your Child	It’s possible for anyone to develop bad habits during their life. In some cases, young children may have bad habits that could actually influence the function and development of their mouth, teeth, and jaws. Examples of this can be thumb sucking, mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting that are persistent.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The reflex of sucking can be a natural occurrence among children at an early age, which normally disappears between the ages of two and four years. However, if the problem persists after four years, the pressure on their upper jaw and front teeth may cause teeth to start moving apart. Plus, it can result in the jaw changing its shape. This conditions might impair their speech and also cause an open bite problem.<br /><br /> With mouth breathing, which relates to a pattern of breathing that is not normal, causing their mouths to remain always open. This can pass direct air into the lungs, and cause muscular alteration functions of their face and tongue. The lower and upper jaw may abnormally grow and cause orthodontic conditions that can be serious.<br /><br /> Some issues that will need habit therapy among children<br /><br /> Two issues that are known to be the biggest problem in children concerning bad habits can include finger or thumb sucking, plus tongue thrusting. The thrusting of the tongue can occur if a child pushes his/her tongue forward onto the teeth constantly. Most of the time they will outgrow such a habit at around four years old. Although, if it doesn’t happen, it may cause their teeth to misalign.<br /><br /> Side effects from misalignment might seriously affect how a child’s face looks. It’s important that you consult a professional dentist for correcting the problems since the child at such a young age won’t understand any of the consequences.<br /><br /> Thumb sucking treatment using orthodontic appliances<br /><br /><br /><br /> When your child persistently sucks his/her thumb, consider getting orthodontic treatment early for stopping this behavior, as well as preventing problems from developing. It’s important to help the child understand what problems can be associated with this habit and suggest different ways to stop it.<br /><br /> Different ways to try and stop the habit may include reminding them about the dangers of the habit. Additionally, at night time place a hand puppet, sock or mitten over the hand. Furthermore, consider using an elbow elastic support that might make it difficult for bending his/her elbow to prevent thumb sucking. Sometimes, these habits are an emotional comfort device and scolding can only worsen the situation.<br /><br /> However, when it doesn’t help, your dentist may suggest an orthodontic appliance, known as a tongue crib which painlessly and gently will stop thumb sucking completely. This treatment can physically prevent the habit and typically, your child’s habit should be over within a couple of months if wearing this appliance.<br /><br /> Treatment appliances for tongue thrusting<br /><br /> This habit happens when your child pushes his or her tongue against the teeth in front while they are swallowing or speaking. A parent might feel it’s not a big issue, though, as time goes by the pressure that is exerted through their tongue onto the teeth may relate to orthodontic open bite problems.<br /><br /> An appliance for tongue thrusting will correct such behavior and prevent the child from thrusting his/her tongue against the teeth. Thus, it can allow the teeth to develop as it should.<br /><br /> This appliance can be placed in a comfortable and safe way to correct the child’s habit. It’s a semi-permanent attachment to the teeth very similar to the way braces are fitted. For the duration it is worn, it will guide the child to correct his/her patterns of behavior. Sometimes it might also be recommended for a child to get a speech or exercise therapy together with such a dental appliance.<br /><br /> Sometimes success can be reached after only a couple of days. All the same, the time it takes doesn’t really matter because once the orthodontist can confirm your child is over the habit, they will remove the appliance. It’s very similar to a palatal crib which may typically be used for preventing a child to suck his/her thumb, it only differs from what this crib actually blocks.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

194	80	2	What Platelet Lysate Treatments Do	Normally Platelets found in the body releases in a slow manner some growth factors to promote healing. Granting, at times the doctor might need to contain these growth factors within platelets so that it’s immediately accessible for promoting healing faster. This is used in areas that are affected by disease or damage.<br /><br /> However, in certain areas of your body where doctors use PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, it might cause a lot of inflammation. Therefore, they prefer to create a Platelet Lysate solution. This is done by cracking the Platelets open and allowing all growth factors to promptly be released into your body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a purely concentrated solution of the growth factors found in plasma once platelets were removed and activated. This regenerative solution that doctor’s use has minimal inflammatory reactions and it’s immediately very active. It’s a preferred solution to treat areas of injured nerves, new stem cells, and in your epidural space.<br /><br /> How effective is therapy with Platelet Lysate?<br /><br /> This procedure can provide relief for a variety of conditions, although, it may vary in effectiveness. It helps the body to do what comes naturally, yet, because every patient’s healing process is different, it will reflect those results. This means that some patients might only need a single treatment, where others will require additional treatments.<br /><br /> Additionally, the reaction may depend on the following factors.<br /><br /> Different conditions or health factors that may attribute to slow healing<br /><br /> Activities after the treatment<br /><br /> Your overall health condition<br /><br /> Response and status of your immune system<br /><br /> Degrees of the damage<br /><br /> The specific area that is damaged<br /><br /> A patient’s age<br /><br /> Advantages of this therapy<br /><br /> There are many advantages with such an innovative therapy which can outweigh problems commonly related to different treatments like steroid injections or surgeries.<br /><br /> Advantages of Platelet Lysate therapy may include the following:<br /><br /> It’s related to healing over the long-term<br /><br /> Easy to perform and prepare<br /><br /> Less inflammatory effects<br /><br /> Recovery periods can be short<br /><br /> Natural cell regeneration<br /><br /> Using a person’s own power of healing<br /><br /> Non-invasive procedure<br /><br /> Such a procedure speeds up the process of natural healing due to the fact that growth factors can be available immediately to tissues that are damaged. It will be directly injected into the area that is damaged, immediately starting the process of healing.<br /><br /> It’s possible to apply Platelet Lysate treatment therapy any number of times. This will depend on what your body may need. When experiencing great improvement its fine to slow down or even stop treatments. On the other hand, when the body is in need of extra support, there won’t be a problem to carry on with the treatment.<br /><br /><br /><br /> About advanced PRP and Platelet Lysate procedures<br /><br /> Treatments with injections of PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, as well as Platelet Lysate contains components of healing and growths that is collected from a person’s own blood. This is used to increase the body’s ability of naturally repairing itself.<br /><br /> These procedures can be used to repair muscle, ligament, tendon, and joint injuries. Thus, it has become very popular among professional athletes. The injections are very effective due to the fact that it stimulates stem cells in the area that is targeted. It promotes those cells to work harder on tissue that is damaged for quicker healing. It is generally used for conditions of the spine, injuries of soft tissues, and mild arthritis.<br /><br /> The procedure of Platelet Lysate therapy<br /><br /> This procedure has less pain and fewer complications than what surgery offers. The doctor will discuss your condition and how the therapy can help you. Together a decision might be made whether it may be right for you.<br /><br /> It’s a fairly simple procedure and the following steps can be done:<br /><br /> To re-inject a mixture of Platelet Lysate into tissues that are damaged, cells are removed from a person’s own blood.<br /><br /> A tiny sample of the blood gets collected to separate platelets out of other components of the blood in order to create PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma.<br /><br /> This will then be subjected to a couple of series of freezing and thawing cycles. This carefully breaks the platelets apart to release its growth factors.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The Platelet Lysate results can then be combined together with just a tiny quantity of some anti-inflammatory medication such as Dexamethasone prior to being injected. Once done, it is injected into the area that is damaged using fluoroscopy or ultrasound which is guided techniques.<br /><br /> Once the procedure is done, you need to plan for enough rest, plus restricting activities for at least forty-eight hours. It might take some time before you will realize that the treatment is working. But once your activities or movements increases and you experience less pain you will know. You can decrease or increase treatments depending on how you feel.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-10 00:00:00	349	m2m
195	80	2	Can Perineal Massage Help You Avoid the Episiotomy?	Labor is a very painful and intense ordeal. The duration of this experience depends a lot on the strength of the contractions, the size of the baby, and the anatomy of the birth canal. The perineum is the area of the body between the anus and the vulva. You should rub or knead the muscles in order to relieve muscle tension. Perineal massage consists in rubbing or kneading the perineal muscles of a pregnant woman in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to allow these muscles and the surrounding tissue of the birth canal to stretch and relax prior delivery so an episiotomy can be avoided. When the canal birth is too narrow and when the baby is putting too much pressure on this area during childbirth, an episiotomy is required. An episiotomy is a cutting of the muscular area, commonly known as the perineum in order to help enlarge the vaginal opening during childbirth.<br /><br /> This area is exactly located between the vagina and the anus. It is normally done when the perineum is too rigid and too tight to allow a normal and easy delivery. It is also done to prevent tearing of the perineal wall as the baby tries to pass through the birth canal. It is also performed in order to allow a fast delivery of the baby. An episiotomy is seen as a necessary evil because, despite the practical reasons for doing it, it leads to some extra pain and discomfort after birth.<br /><br /> This can last up to a couple of days or a couple of weeks. It also changes the structure of the perineum permanently, as most of the muscles get replaced by a scar tissue. To reduce the possibility of an episiotomy, or a perineal tear, several practices have been tried over the years, and perineal massage is one of those. Perineal massage has a long and rich history, with the Chukchi Eskimos in Siberia using glass bottles and African tribes using gourds.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to increase the size of the vaginal canal and to increase the elasticity of the perineal area. The beautiful thing about a perineal massage is that it is relatively easy to perform. It does not require any special equipment, and you or your partner can do it in the absence of any medical professional. The massage is preferably done after taking a bath. You will need to take a comfortable position, wash your hands and lubricate your thumb with a water-based lubricant.<br /><br /> You can choose natural lubricants like olive oil or almond oil if you prefer. Once the hands are cleaned and lubricated, you need to place the thumb inside the vagina. The thumb should be inserted until the first knuckle of it is at the same level with the mouth of the vagina. This means that about 1-1.5 inches of your thumb would be inserted into the vagina. With the thumbs still in the vagina, push downwards towards the direction of the anus, and outwards towards the sides.<br /><br /> Keep pushing till you feel a burning and a stretching sensation. Hold your thumbs in place at this point for a minute or two. After that move your thumbs in around the lower half of the vagina by moving in a “U” shape from side to side for about 10 minutes. That way you will massage the side walls and the base of the vagina as well. Like massages on every other part of the body, it is not a one-time procedure, but should be done repeatedly.<br /><br /> Some experts recommend 6-10 sessions starting from 4-6 weeks before expected due date and continuing until the child is born. Interestingly, the upper half of the vagina does not need to be massaged, as it is surrounded by bones. The urethra is also found in this area, and any attempt to massage it may lead to some level of discomfort and even urinary tract infections.<br /><br /> You will want to avoid the upper half of the vagina during the perineal massage as you won’t have any profit from it. Women have reported an increase in the width of their birth canal with each session of perineal massage. Certain researchers have also been conducted in order to show the effectiveness of the perineal massage in preventing perineal tears and episiotomy during delivery.<br /><br /> One of such research's in the UK noted that there was a 6.1% reduction in second and third - degree tears. And there were episiotomies in women who did perineal massage during the last month of their pregnancy. The effects were higher in women over the age of 30 years old who were having their first baby. This is probably because of the fact that older women normally have a more rigid perineum compared to women at their 20’s.<br /><br /> The perineal massage helps widen the birth canal and make its walls more elastic and less likely to tear. In younger women who were having their first babies, the effect on their still elastic perineum is minimal. For women who have had previous episiotomies and women who had perineal tears in their previous pregnancies, perineal massage does not have much effect. This is due to the fact that the scar tissue is already formed by the previous damage to the perineum.<br /><br /> Normally, this scar tissue is not that strong as the muscle is. Therefore, despite the massage, there is a minimal change in the width of their birth canal. However, these women can still need an episiotomy during the childbirth. Despite the effectiveness of the perineal massage, there are some people who it is not recommended for. These include women who have had preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes in the past, or currently have a vaginal infection.<br /><br /> It is also wise to stop perineal massage if it causes discomfort or stimulates contraction. Whether or not you decide to try the perineal massage, it is very important that you keep your appointments with your obstetrician. No amount of personal research can replace the competence of a skilled physician.<br /><br /><br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-01 00:00:00	379	m2m
196	80	2	Why Would Couples Choose a Procedure for Gender Selection?	Most couples would like to have children of both sexes, especially in our current way of life where more and more people prefer smaller families. This is due to the fact that everything is so expensive. With today technology it’s possible for doctors through fertility treatments that are more advanced, to identify female and male embryos.<br /><br /> This option is available to couples today. In addition, couples can now also avoid passing on genetic sex-linked disorders to their children. The same goes for parents that want to balance their family and already have a child or children of one sex. Choosing a child’s gender has been subjected to a variety of debates quite extensively due to ART/assisted reproductive technology since it started.<br /><br /><br /><br /> I was very lucky through the conventional way to have two children and one of each gender. Yet, many couples might try for conceiving a boy or a girl and don’t see success until maybe the fifth time. By selecting your baby’s gender which is also called family balancing, it’s possible to have both sexes and keep the family smaller. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> In certain countries, this procedure might only be permitted for preventing transmission of genetic sex-linked diseases. Although, in others, it can be a practice that is common in fertility clinics.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> During development of an embryo, the differentiation of gender may occur prior to fertilization. It’s usually determined by the contribution of genetic material of a father’s sperm because he carries an X and Y chromosome which is responsible for a baby’s gender. Women’s egg cells carry only the X chromosome which means the combination can either be XX for a girl and XY for a boy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to this factor, selecting a gender may involve manipulation during an early stage of embryonic development or fertilization. Techniques of assisted reproduction can allow couples in choosing their baby’s gender during these specific stages.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Stages may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br />Before you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This involves a procedure to choose a sperm for a couple’s desired gender prior to fertilization and allow the fertility doctor to perform it without using IVF. <br /><br />  <br /><br />After you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The doctor selects an embryo for the gender that is desired directly after it’s fertilized and then transfers the embryo back into the uterus of the mother.<br /><br />  <br /><br />While a woman is pregnant<br /><br /><br /><br /> In this case, a woman can voluntarily terminate her pregnancy, if the baby is not the gender they desire, which is called sex-selective abortion.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to reasons that are ethical, this type of abortion won’t be a recommended technique in choosing an unborn baby’s gender. Although, woman have the option to choose a VTOP/voluntary termination of pregnancy, which will purely depend on their choice.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Couples that choose a procedure to select the gender of their new baby will very often have opinions like these listed below.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Some couples believe if they have lost a child they can choose gender. Choosing a gender that is the same for their new baby won’t replace the one they have lost, but it might help them to work through the loss.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s been suggested that when a parent receives the gender of their choice, they can love the child more, but that is not really relevant to everyone.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This procedure may help in preventing any gender-related diseases of being transmitted to the new baby, which can benefit the child and the parent.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> New parents that plan for balancing their family with fewer children in this economy, might prefer selecting their children as it will be easier to provide them with what they need.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> For a part of the community that doesn’t believe in choosing your child’s gender, it can raise the following points as listed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> They feel it’s not really necessary and very expensive, as well as the fact that it won’t increase the likelihood to fall pregnant.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s not always a hundred percent accurate except when the chosen technique is IVF together with PGD to select the gender, but it’s the option that is most expensive.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Most couples prefer to guess their baby’s gender while pregnant. Thus, by choosing the gender up front, it can eliminate the surprise element. However, a couple that wants a boy and a girl, who after four tries, just have either boys or girls, won’t agree with a guessing game.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Sometimes others might say it may contribute to inequality of gender and cause an imbalance.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2017.

A mouth that is clean is not just necessary for appearance and to eat with comfort, but it also will reduce the risk to develop infection and disease. With any periodontal disease, bacteria within the mouth may easily be carried into different areas of the body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You should consult your dentist for assistance in regards to reclaiming your oral hygiene. Thus, keeping it at a level that is high. It’s important to fill cavities, plus remove any teeth that can’t be repaired.

In order to undergo this specific procedure, it’s necessary to understand what it entitles, as well as the benefits and risks.<br /><br /> About osseous surgery and the reason for doing it<br /><br /> People that suffer from a periodontal disease will be at risk that their teeth, gums, and bone can be destroyed. This disease causes pockets to form around teeth, which is very common and it can spread to other teeth as well. Additionally, it can develop into a breeding ground that increases infections throughout the body. With a mouth that is healthy, gums fit snugly against the teeth to prevent bacteria and food of reaching the area below the gum line.<br /><br /> In the beginning of this condition, it is easier to remove debris from problem areas, but as time goes by, treatment may be difficult, or sometimes even impossible to correct. The dentist will be able to clean the pockets through a reduction surgery for pocket depth’s and prevent further damage along with any infections. It can help you to keep a healthy and cleaner mouth, provided that you maintain good routines of oral health and go for dental cleanings regularly.<br /><br /> The main aim of osseous surgery is to remove all bacteria and debris from your pockets. Gum tissue will be folded back to expose the area around your tooth to clean it. If the tissue of your bone is also damaged, the dentist can smooth it as well. Bacteria can grow and hide even in the smallest of irregularities of your bone. This procedure can allow the tissue of the gum to reattach to the bone that is healthy more effectively.<br /><br /> Afterwards, your dentist can remove some extra tissue of the gum and use tiny stitches to keep your gum in its place to allow for natural healing. Sometimes, they might use a special kind of bandage for dentals.<br /><br /> It’s possible to experience swelling after your surgery, therefore you should apply on the outside an ice pack covering the area that is treated. This will help to reduce any discomfort. Your dentist might also prescribe antibiotics for prior, during, as well as after you have had your treatment.<br /><br /> Some risks factors<br /><br /> The same as any other surgical procedure, osseous surgery can also have risks. Even if you take proper care of your mouth, there might be a chance of infection to develop within the area. Although, by keeping up good oral care and if aftercare is performed properly, it may minimize your risk.<br /><br /> Additionally, gum tissue around your teeth that are treated can recede faster than the rest of the gums. This can cause your treated teeth to look as if they are longer than what the other teeth are. However, when this happens your dentist will be able to treat it.<br /><br /> Different risks might include sensitivities that can increase towards temperatures. It may be necessary to drink beverages that are cold through a straw and to avoid chewing foods that are very hot with your treated teeth. Because these teeth may be at a higher risk for cavities that is root-based, it’s very important to maintain oral care at a level that is high. <br /><br /> Benefits of this surgery<br /><br /> Recovery is easy and fast<br /><br /> Prevent future bacteria buildup<br /><br /> It can smooth a service that is irregular<br /><br /> Damage can be prevented<br /><br /> Attacking all bacteria<br /><br /> Pocket depth can be reduced<br /><br /> Your gums and teeth should fit together snugly in order to protect teeth from every type of infection.

198	80	2	And So Our Holiday Truly Starts	My heart starts to race excitedly and the plane starts it's decent. We are here, finally, we are here. It has felt like an eternity before our ocean holiday eventually started.<br /><br /> When my husband and myself got married, we procured some holiday points. It helps a lot as all the places to go to on holiday is sooo expensive.<br /><br /> So, since then we have had a tradition to save up our points for 3 years and then go on one nice long holiday. And here we are again. The ocean is calling, beckoning us to its shores with 3 kids in tow now.<br /><br /> Before our trip, we made a turn at our doctor to ensure the area where we were going was safe. We asked about injections for malaria and other viruses that may be present in the area. Once everything was medically done and safe we were on our way.<br /><br />Renting a car, first things first. <br /><br /> After getting our luggage we all followed Papa bear to the car rental service at the airport. While walking, the kids are having an argument about what color the car should be. Child no 1 wants a Pink car, really, can’t see that one happening, no 2 wants a blue car and no 3, well, she’s just looking at them as if a ball is being passed.<br /><br /> Papa bear winks at me when we get to the front desk of the rental car company, then he puts on an extremely serious face as he continues to ask – “Hi, there, please sir, my daughter wants a pink car, any in stock?”<br /><br /> I feel a giggle rising up at the pit of my stomach but manage to keep a straight face. No 1 is looking with so much expectation at the rental guy that I’m sure his squirming under the intensity of her stare.<br /><br /> To Mr rentals credit, he smiles and very seriously replies – “I am so sorry sir, the last pink chariot has left the building prior to your arrival.” No 1’s face drops with disappointment. Papa bear turns and says “So sorry honey bun, no pink ones. Maybe next time.”<br /><br /> “So, what do you have in blue?” Mr rental guy smiles and starts to tell us all our options. We ended up deciding between 3.<br /><br /> Chrysler town got an immediate no from papa bear. I knew why he’s itching to test drive either the Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape. So, when the Rental guy did not mention either of those in blue, I knew it was coming.<br /><br /> “Do you have either Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape?”<br /><br /> I could see the pent-up excitement on his face. When Mr. Rental guy confirmed that they do in fact have a 2016 Ford Escape in red, I could see papa bear jumping up and down on the inside.<br /><br /> “So kids, what about a red car?” They were easily persuaded and Papa bear was ecstatic. I did not dare touch him due to fear of being shocked. Seriously, if I looked closer, I was sure I could see tiny static running all over his being.<br /><br />Here we go<br /><br /> The bonus of flying is that there is not so much luggage. Thus, the luggage fitted in the Escape without any difficulty.<br /><br /> The nice thing about renting a car is that you get to properly test drive a car, in our case for two weeks. Papa bear was like a little boy as he was cruising down the highway. He was explaining to me about the 1.6L engine that delivers 178hp at 5700rpm. Additionally, the base model is front wheel drive and the one we are currently driving is an all-wheel-drive model. It also features a 15.5-gallon gas tank and delivers a fuel consumption of 22/29mpg.<br /><br /> He was carrying on like a dedicated car salesman. I smiled and made an hmm sound while I smiled and nodded at all the appropriate spaces. I knew this big boy was just like a little boy with a new toy. As they say right, boys and their toys…<br /><br />Meeting the local seagulls<br /><br /> We went to a nice little roadhouse next to the beach for some lunch. We got our order and parked the Escape so that we were overlooking the ocean. We sat outside on the rocks. Such a nice view as the waves broke and the wind gently sprayed us with ocean mist.<br /><br /> No 2 was holding a fry out of the window as he stared across the ocean when suddenly something grabbed the fry out of his hand. He screamed like a little girl! <br /><br /> A seagull took advantage of the hypnotic effect of the ocean and before we knew it we were surrounded by fry-stealing seagulls coming from who knows where.<br /><br /> Suddenly, we knew what it felt like to be surrounded.<br /><br /> The kids freely gave up the last of their fries in fear of seagull stares going mafia on us or being bitten. This, we took as our queue to get moving again.<br /><br />The Escape<br /><br /> The rest of our trip ran smoothly even though we had two nights of extreme mozzy (miskito, the insect kind) attacks, we knew all was fine. Everyone had their injections and no viruses were going to make us ill.<br /><br /> We enjoyed BBQ’s in the sunset overlooking the ocean and playing in the sand. We even got the opportunity to see some crabs and dolphins.<br /><br /> The thing I loved about the Escape, the SUV, is the large back seat, the kids had a ball, with plenty of space for themselves. The front seemed a bit smaller than with other SUV’s I’ve seen but the backseat and the luggage space makes up for it.<br /><br /> Some other small things that also made me like the Escape was the cruise control, backup camera and illuminating vanity mirrors. But the best is the overhead storage compartment, I could really get used to those. I can start to see why Papa Bear had his eye on the Escape. I just wonder does it come in pink?<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br /> The trip was amazing, we loved the Ford Escape and the escape from our busy lives’. The calming effect of the oceans draw refreshed us and we gained new strength to face our lives back home again. We were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br /><br /> How awesome was the fact that we need not drive all those miles back home. We got on an airplane with the refreshing effects of a 2-week ocean holiday still lingering all around us even as we got back home. On top of it all, we were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br />Article last time updated on 12.10.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-10-01 00:00:00	247	m2m
199	80	2	Everything You Should Know About a YAG Capsulotomy Procedure	Yttrium Aluminum Garnet also called YAG, is a procedure that produces infra-red laser light impulses. It is used to create small openings within tissue that are targeted through a process known as photo-disruption. Generally, it’s used for treating the iris and secondary cataracts. Sometimes doctors might also use it in treating problems with the retina at the eye’s back.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Indications<br /><br /> There is a variety of eye conditions treatable with this procedure. Conditions of the eyes that can be treated with a YAG capsulotomy procedure may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    If there are vision interferences with activities during the day.<br /><br /> •    When vision in patients decreases that have multifocal intraocular lenses that might specifically be sensitive to even tiny changes of the posterior capsular.<br /><br /> •    Increased glaring.<br /><br /> •    Difficulty to visualize the fundus.<br /><br /> •    With Z syndrome and lens tilting that is related to hinge compliant lenses, like the Trulign toric and Crystalens lenses. Z syndrome may occur if one hap tic arched posterior and the other anterior, and lens tilting can occur if one hap tic is arched either posterior or anterior and the other is planar.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In some cases, it’s possible for a tiny anterior capsular contraction, capsulorrhexis or capsular phimosis may occur. With such excessive anterior scarring to your intra-ocular lens, it might compromise your vision. Alleviation by anterior radial capsulotomies will be achieved through YAG laser treatment.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> About the procedure<br /><br /> To remove the haze capsule is a minor procedure that only requires dilation of your eye.<br /><br /> The doctor will numb your eye’s front by using special eye drops, after which he/she places a tiny contact lens on the eye. Then your head needs to rest on the YAG laser machine’s frame so that your doctor can focus the laser onto the capsule.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Small holes will be made by this laser into the capsule, in such a pattern which allows the doctor to determine what can be the best treatment for your specific condition.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Because there isn’t any incision required, you won’t feel pain or be at risk to develop infections. However, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drops for your eyes after the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Benefits of YAG capsulotomy procedures<br /><br /> •    The treatment is basically pain-free.<br /><br /> •    There isn’t any risk to get an infection.<br /><br /> •    It’s an outpatient treatment procedure.<br /><br /> •    Less healing time and trauma for your eye.<br /><br /> •    The procedure only lasts for a few minutes, though you might have to stay between one and two hours.<br /><br /> •    Reduced cost.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Recovery after the procedure<br /><br /> After the procedure, you can immediately resume normal activities and expect improvement of your vision within one day. Yet, you might experience some degree of floaters for a couple of weeks following the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> At the completion of the procedure, it’s important after a week to go back for a follow-up so that your doctor can examine the overall results, vision, and pressure. You should only as a precaution each day after your procedure tests your eye sight. Do this by closing your eye which hasn't had the surgery, and checks your eye’s vision.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Every year following the treatment you need to go for a checkup of your eyes. This is done to check for any other problems, as well as glaucoma because if your eye is just slightly unusual, examinations are critical.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Any possible risks to a YAG Capsulotomy procedure<br /><br /> Serious problems are very rare in a posterior YAG capsulotomy because it’s an extremely effective and safe procedure. However, the same as with any type of medical procedure, there might be some degree of risks involved.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The one that is very common may be the pressure that rises within your eye. When this happens the doctor can prescribe some eye drops, or maybe some combination of drops and tablets for reducing this pressure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A risk that might be a bit higher can be the detachment of your retina, as well as swelling of your macula. Nonetheless, both of these risks are quite rare, if your original surgery for cataracts with laser treatment was performed over six months earlier.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> By consulting an experienced professional eye specialist for this procedure, it may minimize your risks significantly involving posterior YAG capsulotomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Once your doctor and you decided that a posterior YAG capsulotomy will be the right choice for you, the doctor can provide you with extra information to allow you in making an informed decision of whether you want to proceed. Make sure that all questions you may have are answered to your full satisfaction.<br />Article last time updated on 24.08.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-08-24 00:00:00	365	m2m
200	80	2	Hysterectomy Types and Complications	What is a Hysterectomy and why is it performed?<br /><br /><br /><br /> A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that consists of removing the uterus. The uterus of a woman may cause pain due to a medical issue. In this case, a doctor or gynecologist can examine the uterus and run some tests to see what the issue is. If it cannot be cured, the uterus may be removed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The most common reasons a woman needs to undergo a hysterectomy procedure are as follow:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Uterine fibroids,<br /><br /> •    Endometriosis,<br /><br /> •    Adenomyosis,<br /><br /> •    Abnormal vaginal bleeding,<br /><br /> •    Chronic pelvic pain,<br /><br /> •    Pelvic inflammatory disease,<br /><br /> •    Cervical dysplasia,<br /><br /> •    Cervical cancer,<br /><br /> •    Uterine cancer,<br /><br /> •    Ovarian cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy types<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Today, there are different surgical techniques used for performing a hysterectomy when needed, such as:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Vaginal hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed through the vagina. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of endometrial hyperplasia, cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Total abdominal hysterectomy – is the most common type of hysterectomy performed among women worldwide. This surgical procedure consists of a total removal of the uterus including the cervix. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of ovary cancer, uterine cancer, large uterine fibroids, endometriosis, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Supracervical hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed but the cervix is spared. A supracervical hysterectomy is recommended in cases when there is no medical indication for removing the cervix. However, later in life, there is always the possibility of cancer development in this part of the cervix that has not been surgically removed at the same time as the uterus.  This type of hysterectomy decreases the risk of vaginal prolapse as it provides some kind of support for the vagina.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopy – assisted vaginal hysterectomy – is a similar surgical procedure to the vaginal hysterectomy, but includes the use of a laparoscope. During this procedure, the upper part of the abdomen is carefully inspected when needed. Such as in cases when the removal of the ovaries is planned as well, or in cases of early stages of endometrial cancer.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy – is similar to laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Though, the difference between these two surgical procedures consists of the fact that in laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy the uterus is separated from the cervix and later removed through a laparoscopic incision. The cervix is preserved in this type of surgery. Thus, the recovery period is faster.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Radical hysterectomy – is an extensive type of surgery usually performed in cases where early stages of cervical cancer are noted. This surgical procedure consists of not only removing the uterus and the cervix but also removing the upper part of the vagina and the surrounding tissues as well. There is a great possibility of a urinary system injury, as well as a bowel injury.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Oophorectomy and scalping - oophorectomy is a surgical procedure which consists of the removal of the ovaries in cases of oophorectomy. In the case of scalping - oophorectomy the adjacent Fallopian tubes are removed as well. These two surgical procedures combined with hysterectomy are performed in cases of ovarian cancer, Fallopian tube cancer, uterine cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy Complications<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Just like any surgical procedure, a hysterectomy has its own risks and possible complications. However, in most of the cases, women do not have any complications at all after this surgical procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> According to different studies, vaginal hysterectomies are linked with fewer risks and complications when compared to abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomies. The more radical the surgical procedure is the greater is the possibility of various risks and complications following hysterectomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Also, the recovery period is shorter in cases of vaginal hysterectomy, when compared to laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomies. Hysterectomy risks and complications greatly depend upon the type of hysterectomy procedure performed, as well as, the overall health of the women undergoing the surgery.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Common risks and complications following a hysterectomy regarding of its type include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Blood clots,<br /><br /> •    Heavy blood loss,<br /><br /> •    Bladder injury,<br /><br /> •    Bowel injury,<br /><br /> •    Infection,<br /><br /> •    Adhesions in the pelvic area,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Weakness of the pelvic muscles and ligaments which normally support the vagina, rectum and the bladder,<br /><br /> •    Difficulties urinating,<br /><br /> •    Early menopause,<br /><br /> •    Anesthesia problems, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Recovering after hysterectomy<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Even though a hysterectomy is a safe surgical procedure, it is often associated with various risks and complications. In general, hospitalization for a couple of days and sometimes weeks following the surgery is required. It only depends on the overall health of the patient and the reason why this procedure is performed in the first place. The recovery period will also depend on the type of hysterectomy performed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In cases of vaginal hysterectomy, the recovery period is faster compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, and even longer for an abdominal hysterectomy. After a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, women should be able to return to their normal daily routines within three to four weeks. In cases of abdominal hysterectomy, the recovery period will take a little bit longer, about four to six weeks.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> However, for a certain period of time after the surgery lifting heavy things, pushing or pulling objects, bending and even sexual intercourse should be avoided.<br />Article last time updated on 23.08.2017.

201	81	2	Cervical Biopsy And Pregnancy	There are many discussions about the cervical biopsy during pregnancy. Usually this type of diagnostics is appointed by gynecologists only on serious reason. This reason is the suspicion on some oncology disease in a patient. The tissues of the uterus must undergo a thorough analysis to determine the clinical picture. There is a popular meaning among doctors that only women who have already gone through labor may undergo it and certainly, it is forbidden to the patients expecting a baby.<br /><br /> A pregnant women undergoes plenty of different analyses. Among them are those which are necessary for every pregnant woman and some individual ones in case if the doctor has suspicions. The cervical biopsy is appointed if there are reasons to think about some pathological processes in the uterus. Still, it is rather an unwanted procedure during the pregnancy.<br /><br /> How does the cervical biopsy perform? The cervix is forced to protrude and it is actually traumatized by taking the examples of tissues for the examination. Of course, the uterus will react on this traumatization. It will constrict and there is a big chance of the pregnancy miscarriage.<br /><br /> However, sometimes the reasons for this appointment are quite serious. If there is a cancer diagnosed, sometimes it is required to get rid of the pregnancy to save a woman’s life. Nevertheless, if the situation is not that dangerous, it is better to start treatment after the labor. The earlier stages of cancer usually allows a woman to carry the pregnancy and undergo labor.<br /><br /> If there is an appointment of cervical biopsy in a pregnant woman, perhaps there can be the other way. It will be better to consult some more specialists or undergo additional analyses. If the reason is erosion or dysplasia, there is no emergency in doing biopsy. It can wait until the labor. Sometimes erosion just passes after it, so do not hurry with decisions.<br />Article last time updated on 04.01.2018.	Amelia Grant	2018-01-03 00:00:00	178	m2m
202	81	2	Teeth Sensitivity In Children	If adults suffer from sensitive teeth very much, imagine how terrible this feeling for children is. If the adult can verbalize his complaints and give a clue about the pain’s localization, with children it is not that simple. A child hardly can explain the character of the tooth pain. It is very difficult to know whether it is the increased sensitivity or something else. The only information parents usually receive is an abstract teeth pain while eating or brushing. Therefore, the reason cannot be clearly determined without visit to dentist. <br /><br />  <br /><br />There is a list of main factors provoking the increased sensitivity of kid’s teeth.<br /><br />1.       Caries. If a child’s tooth or several of them became sensitive, it may mean that there are cavities in those teeth. It is one of the most widely spread reasons of such problem in children. <br /><br />2.       Freshly appeared teeth. When primary teeth are lost, the new teeth may bother a child. They have not enough strength to resist the influence of air, sour and cold food.<br /><br />3.       Sinusitis. It seems that there is no connection between teeth sensitivity and sinus problems. However, it is a tendency of these two diseases often going together. <br /><br />4.       Filling material. If a child’s teeth were restored with the usage of silver amalgam, they can become sensitive afterwards. It is connected with high thermal conductivity qualities of this material.<br /><br />5.       Enamel fractures. They occur not only in adults. If a child has problems with occlusion or bruxism, tiny fractures can appear on his teeth and bring him much discomfort. Especially they are painful during eating.<br /><br />6.       Wrong cleaning technique. It is not a widely spread reason of teeth sensitivity in children but still there is such chance. If a child brushes his teeth too aggressively, he can traumatize a gum and an enamel of teeth. That is why teaching children proper techniques of mouth hygiene from the earliest age is very important.<br /> Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-26 00:00:00	166	m2m
203	81	2	3D-Layering in Cosmetic Dentistry	We live in an era of astonishing scientific and technological progress. The technologies are improving faster than we could ever believe it possible. The progress touches all the spheres of our living including healthcare. The newest scientific achievements are making the process of treatment more effective, convenient and fast. It is especially important for dentistry service that is to improve not only the existing mouth health problems but the aesthetic ones too. The 3D-technologies are here to make a revolution in the cosmetic dentistry.<br /><br /> Let us take a front tooth fracture for an example. It is quite a common thing in childish age. As a rule, the problem occurs because of the tooth trauma. The traditional strategy of treatment in such cases is adhesive restoration of the tooth. It is very difficult to match the color of the composite perfectly to the natural color of the patient’s teeth. 3D technologies allow the convenient and effective process of the color selection with usage of the innovational composite materials.<br /><br /> The model of a tooth that needs to be restored is printed on 3D-printer and doubled with the use of the special form for the individual scheme of shades. The special computer program helps with that. The shades of enamel and dentine are determined before the restoration of the tooth and creating an individual shade scheme. The special SpectroShade device determines the exact shade needed and the thickness of enamel and dentin.<br /><br /> The i3D- technology fully reconstructs the 3D-structure of the real tooth. Materials allows to be corrected within the limits of a certain thickness. Some additional effects allow being placed between the dentin and enamel if necessary. As a final part of the restoration, the material is applied layer by layer. The i3D layering technique  is proven to be a perspective for the further innovations in the field of composite materials’ production.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.

204	81	2	Nuvaring: Pros And Cons	Nuvaring is one of the innovational method of contraception. It has hormonal action but does not come in the form of pills. It is a hypoallergenic hormonal ring that is inserted into a woman’s vagina. The ring is elastic and when inserted into a woman’s body, repeats the shape of her inside.  It contains micro doses of such hormones as estrogen and progestagen that prevent pregnancy. It is a monophasic combined contraceptive method that is inserted by woman herself in one of the first five days of menstrual period.<br /><br />How does Nuvaring work? Under the influence of the temperature of a woman’s body, a ring extracts little doses of hormones every day. They get straight into the ovaries and uterus and interfere with the ovulation process.  This process does not involve the endocrine system because the hormones are getting into a woman’s sex organs at once. That is why Nuvaring does not give a woman many of the side effects going together with oral contraceptives.<br /><br /> The undoubted advantages of the Nuvaring use are:<br /><br /> It does not interfere with sexual intercourse and has no influence on the both partners’ feelings.<br /><br /> It is inserted once a month. A woman does not have to bother herself with remembering to take the pill by schedule.<br /><br /> It does not influence a woman’s way of life. She can do sports and lead an active life without even a feeling of something foreign inside her.<br /><br /> It has quite a good percentage of effectiveness – 99, 9%.<br /><br /> It is available to purchase in many places.<br /><br /> But it also has its drawbacks:<br /><br />  There is quite a big list of contraindications. Among them are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, gynecological diseases, kidney diseases.<br /><br />  It does not provide any STD prevention.<br /><br />  A woman must not use it while breastfeeding.<br /><br />  The price of Nuvaring is rather high.<br /><br /> It also has its certain side effects. Among them are headache, dizziness and even vomiting, allergic reaction and vaginitis. Sometimes the individual specialties of a woman’s organism do not allow her using Nuvaring, so the full diagnostic of organism before choosing it is recommended.<br />Article last time updated on 02.01.2018.

205	81	2	The Laser Treatment Of Periodontitis	Periodontitis is a severe gum disease that can lead to a loss of teeth. The innovational treatment strategies are constantly improved to cope with it more successfully. Among the newest periodontitis treatment strategies is laser gum surgery. Laser technique can help even in the most neglected cases. How is the treatment of periodontitis possible with the help of laser? The laser optical fiber is inserted into the gum pocket. It coagulates the pathological tissue. The special lighting of the fiber allows controlling the depth of laser penetration. It helps working accurately with tissue not to harm healthy ones.<br /><br /> When the treatment ends, the pocket is left sterile, it closes and does not allow harmful bacteria get in there. If it is the earlier stage of periodontitis, one séance may be enough. If the disease progressed, 2-3 séances are required. They must perform once a week. Different types of laser may be used, the doctor determines which will be better for that individual case.<br /><br /> The advantages of periodontitis laser treatment are obvious. These are:<br /><br />  No blood. During the laser action all the tine vessels are soldered.<br /><br />  No pain. The treatment can perform without any anesthesia. A patient does not feel any  discomfort during the procedure. He can go back to his usual life right after the procedure.<br /><br />  Additional polishing of the tooth root tissues. As the result of treatment a gum sticks tight to the tooth.<br /><br />  A small list of contraindications. Even small children, pregnant women and patients with allergy can undergo the procedure. The treatment with laser does not take much of a patient’s time. It is rather effective, even the first procedure gives good result.<br /><br />  Laser periodontitis treatment does not require any preparations. The procedure is not traumatic and does not require any long recovery. Laser rays destroy any pathological microflora. The procedure guarantees sterility and reduces chances on disease in future.<br /> Article last time updated on 22.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-22 00:00:00	165	m2m
206	81	2	Turner’s Hypoplasia Diagnostics	White spots on baby teeth are not just a cosmetic defect. They may be the sign of the enamel hypoplasia. Enamel hypoplasia means incomplete or defective formation of the teeth enamel organic matrix on the germ stage. Hypoplastic effect damages the tooth surface and shape. In most of the cases, it expresses through the local loss of the tooth enamel. It looks like a single lacuna or a row of them surrounding the tooth horizontally. Those lacunae also can conjoin in one fissure. The other severe form of hypoplasia is hypocalсification of enamel. If hypoplasia is the defective formation of the enamel matrix that causes lack of the tissue, hypocalcification provides enough tissue but of poor quality.<br /><br /> The case of Turner’s hypoplasia means an infection that attacks primary teeth or the germs of constant ones in the period of germ formation. Local infection near the apex or trauma of the primary tooth can touch the constant tooth germ too. If infection occurs in the process of the crown formation, it can lead to a further hypoplasia or hypomineralization of the enamel. Lower bicuspids suffer from Turner’s hypoplasia more often, because constant molars above them are very vulnerable to the infection. Constant central incisors mostly suffer from this disease as the result of primary teeth trauma.<br /><br /> The visual diagnostic of Turner’s hypoplasia is possible because the discoloration and pathological changes of enamel are obvious. The X-ray examination may show the deformation of the apex or root, thus can give the ideas about the provoking factor of the disease. Histological analysis will help determine the deep structural changes of the enamel. The treatment of Turner’s hypoplasia requires a complex approach. According to the results of X-ray, the consequences of the problem (it may be trauma or infection) must undergo correction. The cosmetic defect is to be corrected by applying prostheses (veneers or crowns depending of the amount of enamel and dentin destruction).<br />Article last time updated on 21.12.2017.

207	81	2	Teeth Whitening Strips	Nowadays the domestic methods of teeth whitening gained much popularity. Doctors do not consider them the safest way of manipulations with teeth. However, thanks to the convenience and cheapness, they are widely used by many people. Among them quite popular is the method of teeth whitening stripes. The beauty bloggers are recommending them to people and there is a wide assortment of the stuff available. But is it really that safe and convenient?<br /><br /> Among the side effects of whitening stripes usage are inflammation of the gums and increased teeth sensitivity. This does not stop people who do not want to pay a fortune in a dentistry clinic for the professional procedure. People are attracted by their convenience comparing to whitening mouth guards that are well known as one of the most effective domestic whitening methods. They are very simple in use. Together with the whitening toothpastes, strips are expected to have more effect of teeth color improvement.<br /><br /> How do the whitening strips work? They are made of polyethylene and covered with the hydrogen peroxide. This is the active element that provides teeth whitening. A full set consists of the strips for upper and lower teeth rows. The instruction for their usage is very simple – press them tight to your teeth and leave for a half an hour. It must be done twice a day with an interval of 12 hours. The concentration of the active element varies from 6 to 10 per cent in different products.<br /><br /> Of course, the best way to whiten teeth is to do it in a dentistry clinic under the control of the specialist. However, if you decide to try whitening strips at home, keep the rules of safety while using them. They are quite simple –use the toothpaste for sensitive teeth not to bring them more harm and rinse your mouth after strips usage. This helps washing out the active substance not to let it harm your gums. Choose the strips with the smallest concentration of hydrogen peroxide. And if the problems will not pass or even increase, stop using strips and visit your dentist as soon as you can.<br />Article last time updated on 20.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-20 00:00:00	170	m2m
208	81	2	Sweet Addiction: First Signs Of The Problem	Perhaps, all people in the world like sweets. They are tasty and sometimes it seems impossible to resist the desire to have a doughnut or chocolate cake. It is no big deal to indulge yourself from time to time. However, consuming too much sugar containing products is extremely destructive for a human organism. It can even become a real drug with all the symptoms of addiction – abstinence syndrome, decreasing of the sensitivity and unpleasant side effects.<br /><br /> If you are the person who cannot live without chocolate, cakes or ice-cream, read this carefully. Here is the list of warning signs signalizing that you have a problem.<br /><br />  1. You literally ALWAYS want something sweet. And the more you eat it, the more you want. It works exactly like a drug. Your taste sensors adapt to the sweet taste with time and begin perceiving it weaker. It means that now you need more sweets to feel the same taste as you did before. Sugar provokes a hormonal splash. That is why you feel stronger and more energetic after eating something sweet. And when the level of sugar decreases, a wish to bring it back appears.<br /><br />  2. You feel weak throughout the day. A splash of insulin after eating sugar caused the splash of energy, but it will not last long. Energy is stable when the sugar level in blood is stable. And if it’s shattered, you feel misbalanced. Stable energy comes out of proteins and fiber, not from sugar.<br /><br />  3. The state of your skin is becoming worse. People who are sensitive to hormonal splashes often suffer from acne and rosacea. They visit dermatologists, try different treatment strategies but have no idea about the real reason of their problem.<br /><br />  4. Your mood goes up and down during the day. Sugar rises and falls, you feel energetic, then everything irritates you. Feeling of weakness does not help to be in good mood either.<br /><br />  5. You are gaining weight. Sugar contains many calories but little nutritive values. Insulin overproduction caused by it also provokes weight gain. Sugar consumption may cause insulin resistance that causes serious problems with metabolism.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 19.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-19 00:00:00	187	m2m
209	81	2	3D-Technologies In Osseous Surgery	There are many cases in medicine when a patient needs bone grafting. It may concern not only bone grafting for dental implants that can be successful set up only in case where enough bone tissue volume is present. Also bone impants are used in treating locomotor apparatus diseases and bone reconstructions. Nowadays there are four types of implants used for these purposes. A person can be his own bone donor – the missing bone tissue can be taken from his own body where the amount allows doing this. If there is no such possibility, other people may become bone donors. There are special programs that allows donating your body on such purposes after death.<br /><br /> But the bone tissue grafts can be taken not only from people. The cattle bones can also be used for implantation. They undergo multiple stages of sterilization to fit for human organism perfectly. Also there exist artificial bone grafts, but they are considered to be the least effective among all of them.<br /><br /> Now the scientists are working on the possibility to use 3D-thecnologies in creating the bone grafting materials. In John Hopkins University (USA) the mix of 30% natural de-cellulosed bone and 70% polymer was invented and tested.  3D-printing is known to reproduce the 3D-structures’ exact copies with full similarity on the thinnest levels. They combined bio-degrading plastic with natural sterilized bone and received good results allowing hopeful prognoses for future.<br /><br /> The scientists of Quebec University used 3D-technologies to print experimental mixes that have such important quality as ability to yield. Hard grafts lead to misbalance of jaws’ work and the wit the yielding grafts balancing abilities will be better. It will help avoid the bone resorption process. In addition, the anti-corrosion qualities of the invented mixes are excellent. It is believed to have very good perspectives for the wide usage in traumatology, spine medicine and orthopedics. <br />Article last time updated on 18.12.2017.

210	81	2	Liquid in the knee	Modern medicine is dealing with the plenty of cases when the synovial liquid is gathering inside the knee joint.  If the symptoms of disease are ignored and the measures aren’t taken, it can become a reason of the motor dysfunction. Synovial surface surrounds the bone joint and muscle tendon in the knee and serves to limit the mobility of this connection and to protect it from possible damage. The epithelial cells of this surface’s inner layer produce special liquid that serves to lubricate the gristles contacting while performing the process of movement and protecting them from being damaged in this process. In addition, it softens some inner strikes on the knee.<br /><br /> Why does this liquid begun to gather inside the knee? The reason is an inflammation process in the synovial surface. The reasons of it can be various. Among the most wide-spread of them are:<br /><br />  Aseptic inflammation. This type of inflammation does not appear because of any pathogenic bacteria or purulent extractions. It may occur because of the knee trauma or become a complication after some viral infection while overcooling the knee. Sometimes it can be caused by gathering of the metabolism products in the knee.<br /><br />  Purulent inflammation. It is a result of getting of the pathogenic microorganisms into the knee and their multiplication. Often it occurs after the heavy traumas of the knee.<br /><br />  Immunity inflammation. It happens because of the excessive extraction of synovial liquid. Pathological immunity complexes damage the epithelium.<br /><br /> What are the main symptoms of liquid in a patient’s knee?<br /><br />  The increasing of the knee size.<br /><br />  Bound motor function – feeling difficulties during the attempts of bending the knee.<br /><br />  An intumescence on the knee that feels elastic and stiff.<br /><br />  Knee pain during the movements.<br /><br />  Reddening of the skin or feeling it hot.<br /><br /> The different types of inflammations require different ways of treatment.  Knee pain doctor will perform the diagnostic, determine the etymology of disease and appoint the suitable treatment strategy. Sometimes the disease can be treated without medication, for example, with the help of physical therapy Brooklyn. Influence of cold or hot temperature will have positive influence on the knee.<br />Article last time updated on 14.12.2017.	Amelia Grant	2017-12-14 00:00:00	175	m2m
211	82	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	623	m2m
212	84	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

213	84	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

214	84	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

215	86	2	Doctors are in the way of progress. And thank God they are.	Article 1: A specialist had reasoned the medical world was in shambles because “specialist” try to rule the world with unnecessary obscurity. His example was acid reflux and how addressing it was a failure in delivering simple remedies. My throat was bitter with betrayal.<br /><br /> Article 2: An insurance company threatened to set an example with a new policy to deny payments for ER visits if a visit was deemed unnecessary as “a primary doctor could have addressed the problem.” Patients with no primary care due to fluctuation in coverage or patients with complex issues without a readied system to address them laid possible victims of idealistic visions of seamless arrangements. The failure was invariably placed on doctors.<br /><br /> Article 3: Another insurer gamed the system as an “advantage program” by mandating the listing of comorbids it then uses to bolster the capitated fee and thus reflect “savings” when said patients are doing well. Profits are had but not by patients. Efforts to relay medical complexity for the sake of fiscal analysis.<br /><br /> Day after day, article after article.<br /><br /> The combination of such headlines spells distrust and the demotion of doctors as leaders. It becomes all rhetoric to negate the physician-patient relationship and physician motive and value.<br /><br /> Doctors are in the way. They are muddying the new world order. I stand ready as a proponent of careful, compassionate care in the middle of a noisy street. I feel tired each day to execute the needed measures and still deliver the thoughtful, heartfelt elements. I rally the profession to be intelligent, diligent, and tender.<br /><br /> Insurance companies make money each year without fail. Doctors are in the way of this prime directive. It seems clear who wins. Insurance companies raise copays, deductibles, premiums and decrease reimbursements to physicians and deny coverage if they deem care “not needed” or “wrongfully delivered in an ER.” It seems clear who wins. Doesn’t it?<br /><br /> Then CMS holds a meeting and measures millions of data points and claims, “It’s working!” They claim they are succeeding in delivering care with financial responsibility. They are balancing the budget, and all they need is more control and fewer doctors running rogue. The doctors detached from the trenches agree that all is well. I feel I am in the way of a boulder coming. My sentiments are not only not important, but they are also misconstrued. I am in the way, and I must, therefore, not want millions to have health care. There will be no validation of the romance of medicine nor the valor of doctoring. There is no algorithm for it, and the boulder is coming. I am made to feel like a silly child coming to the meeting to talk of loving humankind.<br /><br /> So, I go to bed very broken, very sad about my purpose and worth. My entire life working to become a doctor relegates to zero effect with zero distinguishing attributes. I think I should quit medicine and find that thing that is hard to do that saves people and champions life and owns authority bought with hard work and intelligence and nobility. I wonder what profession does that in the new world order.<br /><br /> “It was hard to study through the night year after year,” I recall only faintly because I am being conditioned to inflate my journey.<br /><br /> The next day, I feel exhausted to go to do the work of hoping for nothing exceptional. I wonder what dogma to espouse today that will be fiscal. Medicine in America has no room for the kind of craft and glory I thought defined hope in humanity. It is becoming a factory for widgets, and I am now not a person with experience, judgement or intelligence. I am a drone and replaceable by a model made makeshift another way.<br /><br /> Doctors are in the way.<br /><br /> I don’t look at my office list ahead of time, and one by one they come and very quickly I realize what they are. These patients are all the byproduct of careful negotiations and crafting. One after another, they defy the rules of biology and fall off the margins of algorithms. They are the 40 percent that would have been lost to judgment in a world made orderly by data. One by one, they come in laughing and better. They are the total of over a decade of doctoring under one guideline: Do the right thing.<br /><br /> I forgot how strange Mr. Johnson was coming off dialysis. I forgot how incredible Mrs. Tallessman needed only 1/2 a tablet of a drug twice a week. I forgot how I pushed for Mr. Sands to complete a test that lead to a call the following Monday for a kidney transplant. I absolutely forgot about how Mrs. Edwards almost died three different times until her granddaughter rolled her eyes because that “old woman” is still alive after being given six months to live 10 different times. I forgot about twins for the lady with lupus and discitis with paralysis in the Parkinson’s man who is now walking. I forgot, and I tell each patient how I forgot and that I thank them for being tangible when the intangible thing I am trying to explain cannot be described.<br /><br /> The boulder is coming, and the best we can do is lift it up and over us as we protect our discipline and calling for the good of humanity. We must continue to doctor above algorithms and with the one weapon we have, experience. We must go to do the right thing bar none because one day such sentiments will be what is left to distinguish us from anything, not a doctor.<br /><br /> Doctors are in the way, and thank God we are.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Antranias/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 25.07.2017.

216	86	2	Narrative medicine for social and physician wellness	All doctors have degrees of empathy. We as an order select for this trait as much as spiritual leaders look for spirituality or politicians look for diplomacy. Society even measures doctors according to “bedside manners” which tells us this trait defines our order in a primary sense. We may be many things at once or as well but we are at our core empaths.<br /><br /> As empaths, we succumb to the failings of empaths. We misread. We take on too much energy of all kinds. We feel guilty when we don’t help. We feel burnt out when we haven’t recharged. We are alone except amongst other empaths. It is an infrequently admitted truth that we go to fix problems because the pain we feel doesn’t go away until we fix the problem. When we fail the pain that made us accountable, responsible, and moved stays with us. We fail when others suffer. We fail when people die. There will be things we cannot fix and those things add to the crux of what makes doctors unwell.<br /><br /> Physician wellness must take on a new paradigm.<br /><br /> Narrative medicine as a literary form that engages care providers including physicians to share their witnessed stories of humanity can be an instrumental tool to repeatedly resuscitate the physician. Relationship centered medicine has been considered a way to help doctors stay in love with doctoring and that premise is supported by narrative medicine to help refocus the efforts of medicine around relationships.<br /><br /> 1. The paradigm starts with embracing our identity as learned healers: empathic intelligent leaders. That is what we are born to do and what society needs from our birth. Society expects doctors to be compassionate. Compassion defines doctoring. Empathy is the origin of compassion. We are empaths.<br /><br /> 2. Refueling speaks to what we are. As empaths, we must recharge to then go out and give. Refueling includes time alone. Time with natural elements. Time with other empaths who happen to be our colleagues or aids. Time to grow our self-awareness and mature our natural skills. Security and self-wellness mean there is something to give from.<br /><br /> Running on empty when sick people are coming to you for help will lead to no healing. In fact, it will result in more pains. The patient is unheard. The physician fails and is further depleted. We don’t send broken soldiers to fight. That gets others killed. We don’t allow pilots to fly tired or stressed. That carries human cargo tangibly into danger. Unwell doctors will perpetuate suffering or create more.<br /><br /><br />  3. Realization that healers are wounded by the pain around them and charged by the success around them. This realization explains why we must try to fix problems. Pain of any kind around us hurts us, and the resolution of conflict and pain is a personal relief to us. This awareness leads to solutions to achieve balance and wholeness despite the more often depleting rigors of being a healer.<br />  4. Reconciliation that some pains don’t resolve neatly or timely so we harbor them. They weigh us down and tear into our ability and deplete our reserve. We must thus unload burden of suffering. We can share our pain by logging the journeys we are so privileged to make with others. We can tell those stories to embrace them and then release those details because they increasingly bog down the engine of empathy. Narrative medicine can bring about this. Even narrative medicine by proxy where another writes with or for someone can do this.<br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> 5. Releasing the good and bad that healers stockpile over a day or a week or a lifetime can allow for more encounters and dealings. This is what happens as we seek reconciliation. Currently, physician wellness is flooded with retreats, meditations, and spa relaxations. Narrative medicine is happening now as a medium to connect physicians with themselves, with medicine, with society. It provides to society an actual log of real intimate moments that define humanity and the human condition. Arguably, it is a discourse with healing that can create a conduit to healing the healer.<br /><br /><br />  Writing an intimate story down or sharing an intimate story to be written down or reading an intimate story will all effectively release the healer into a place of renewed purpose and awareness. It will unbridle the empathy so the healer can go back and care again.<br /><br />   <br /><br />  6. Remembering the impact healers make through logged stories and sharing can continue the orders’ main agenda and thus role in society.<br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> Physician wellness is not just about security, work hours, time off, meditation, massages, retreats, recognition, resilience. It is about pushing to the forefront repeatedly who doctors are in society. We are healers. It is about realizing what that means and entails. We are empaths. It is about refueling the ability to care by nurturing our empathy with empathy. It is about releasing what we did and can’t do, what we fixed and can’t fix back into the whole society to own. It is about remembering we are here to help and to play our given gifted role. The area of narrative medicine can help create the paradigm shift to making well those that make society well through active reflection on the humanity in medicine.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />YogawithAmit/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 20.06.2017.

217	86	2	We must break the circle of sexism	Then I got a call from the head of the department. I was asked about another fellow in the program. A male fellow. His behavior was in question. I was asked if he was inappropriate. I said I found him short and awkward. To me, he tried too hard and was often late. I, however, never was the victim of any inappropriateness.<br /><br /> “Why?” I asked.<br /><br /> My intern was questioned as well. She also was perplexed. Never did she have any issues. She stood on a stool to position herself to place central lines, yet never was she made small by this man.<br /><br /> We couldn’t fathom why we were being asked about this rather benign, uninteresting, unimpressive person. Turns out he had been harassing sexually his co-fellow, our team’s fellow, to the point of her depression, stress, and weight loss.<br /><br /> Our lives shook. How was this possible? We were the dream team with brains and poise and beauty.<br /><br /> Sexism seethed into our world, and we were all vulnerable just like that.<br /><br /> Ten years later a male colleague asks me, due to all the Trumpisms that has come up, whether I experience any males at work being “inappropriate.” I think about this world of professionalism and what I experience and see, and I decide there is a circle. The men are automatically in the circle. Even the benign, unimpressive ones. Then some women are let in, and those women are indoctrinated into a blindness. The circle protects those women from being the object of sexism to some extent, but there are many excluded and thus vulnerable. When the women guests leave the circle, it changes. When certain women come around the circle, it changes.<br /><br /> The circle exists everywhere.<br /><br /> My 11-year-old daughter is the third best player on her co-ed team. There are nine total kids with only two girls.<br /><br /> When five boys play they play seamlessly. I feel so exhilarated and proud watching. When they rotate the girls in the team, it creates a strange void such that the 3 to 4 boys present will play amongst themselves and exclude the girls. Rarely do they pass to the girls. If they do, they pass to my daughter more. The weakest members of the team athletically consist of three boys and the other girl besides my daughter.<br /><br /> At school, my daughter asked the boys if she can play basketball with them. They said, “OK. And since you’re a girl you can double dribble, and we will give you 2 points.” She left without engaging. I asked her why not just play or why not refuse the advantage given and play? She said, “I’m already forever disadvantaged. They thought to give me these allowances so now I have to be better than that assumption and better than the worse guy.”<br /><br /> The circle is a creation of sexism. It hides sexism, and the assumptions are an invisible force holding back equality. If you don’t feel sexism, then you maybe are a guest in the circle. You’re just a guest.<br /><br /><br />  Ask yourself, what is the circle that I am in? Are there men present? What is the ratio of men to women? Do they speak of outside women to degrade them in my presence as if I am sanctioning it? Am I fully aware of sexism even if it isn’t directed to me?<br /><br /><br /> The circle still affects social order. Our children are exposed to it. How do we tell them to navigate it? What men are our allies?<br /><br /> “Mom, are you mad? You’re yelling,” my daughter said as we drove away from her last game.<br /><br /> “I am mad, but not at you. They didn’t pass you the ball. They excluded you under no grounds except they didn’t know how to act equally around a girl. I am mad because how can you get better and how can you stand to make a mistake and how can I tell these boys them playing 1 to 2 players down because they won’t use the human ability right in front of them will hurt them all? I’m mad. But not at you,” I explained.<br /><br /> “I told them to pass to me. I was yelling their names,” she said.<br /><br /> “I know. Maybe I should say something to the boys or,” I started<br /><br /> “No mom. Don’t,” my daughter interrupted.<br /><br /> We are in a real bind. We are being asked to not rock the boat and to wait out the bad weather.<br /><br /> An article in Bloomberg entitled, “Women will have to wait another 170 years to close the gender gap,” cited the World Economic Forum which assesses gender gaps when it comes to economic opportunities, political empowerment, education and health between men and women. The date given for expected equality was 2186.<br /><br /> I will be long dead, but I will not sit and say nothing while I’m alive. We owe it to our current colleagues and our daughters.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Susanne Nilsson/flickr/CC BY-SA <br />Article last time updated on 09.05.2017.

218	86	2	Physician burnout may not happen. But “burn in” is guaranteed.	I wanted to tell her birthing and raising a baby isn’t always lavender and lace.<br /><br /> When I started practice ten years ago, I would hear the seniors talk about taking call and traveling from office to hospitals and how a high census was draining their “old bodies.” I felt like a fresh packet of Pop Rocks. I rolled my eyes and asked to double the load for side money. I had a one-year-old then, and she was built to be my daughter. My husband was supportive, and my soul was intact. Never did I see an end to my stamina.<br /><br /> Four years later I dug deep while pregnant with my son and took all my call ahead and performed the entire pregnancy in the top 5. I left for maternity leave and for the first time thought I missed a lot of my first child’s childhood.<br /><br /> Then it happened. After my son was born, I was vulnerable and tired. The juggle of home and now the full practice was weighing on me. It was surely the hours, but it was also the mounting nature of medicine. I had proudly and nobly crafted a practice based on individuals and their specific needs. They came often desperate to have someone hear them. Some came with looks on their faces as if it was the first time in their entire lives they were heard.<br /><br /> I had aged. A lot. I dare say acceleratedly so. Cortisol broke down collagen, and I felt bone on bone in my joints at times. My hair and skin felt dry. I was drying up like a desiccated leaf broken off the tree of life.<br /><br /><br />  I kept going. While pushing through my son’s first year, talk of cutting back hours and duties was a frequent conversation. Part-time doctoring is a misleading concept. You have to run a full-time concern regardless. By the time the director called me to discuss it all my son could eat solids and I was pumping 64 ounces of milk a day; often 15 ounces in 5 minutes so I felt awake again.<br /><br /><br /><br /> “No, I’m OK,” I said.<br /><br /> Eight years into practice and the EMR kept changing, and each EMR had new features and new blanks to fill up and boxes to check. Prior authorizations were sent for drugs older than me and cheaper than a movie ticket. Then the utterly crazy happened and the prior authorizations were being scanned into the EMR and to fill them out required a dozen clicks to create a virtual signature. I stumbled along feeling like I had seven thumbs and no ink in my pen all the while I felt I had experience and a lot of knowledge.<br /><br /> “I know stuff!” but I couldn’t seem to empty my inbox because I was having an error message come up. I had to make patients 2 or more separate appointments to cover everything.<br /><br /> The office got new phones, and they forgot to correct the prompt message and the phones wrongly instructed people to dial “1” which circled patients around again to the greeting. My new phone had a strange cord that was only 12 inches long. When I picked up the receiver as I had done 10,000 times before and placed it in the crook of my neck then turned to type on the computer or sort through papers on my desk the phone crashed to the floor yanked hard by my time saving.<br /><br /> I wanted to laugh, but I was late for the next patient that was double booked because of a potential 10 percent no-show rate. Overhead has to be paid despite decreasing pay to the physician and cost shifting to the patients. Each Congressional session held hostage decisions to revamp, revise, and decrease revenue. Sometimes the threat was a more than 20 percent reduction in payments. I felt tired. I got gastritis.<br /><br /> But that was not the nature of “the burn.” I woke up realizing who the enemy remained as my phone crashed and startled me. Disease, suffering, anxiety, uncertainty, early death, sudden death; these lay as the real combatants. I would still go home mourning patients’ stories of lives changed and broken. I lost by then a hundred patients who had become friends.<br /><br /> What has not changed despite the years is I still listen, and when I listen I absorb and what I absorb are feelings. These feelings make me remember details, try to fix problems with urgency, and try to win against dying and death. Like a water wheel at a mill, I begin to generate the electricity to generate action once I hear and feel my patient. Their feelings give me reason and alertness to think and organize and execute.<br /><br /> And it’s a burn … in. It is a burn into me. And I’m taking it home or wherever I go. It’s caring. And when those moments happen where the problem can’t be fixed failure and loss chip away a little of my effervescence. Thankfully the right perspective or peace despite loss or occasional success will rewick my soul.<br /><br /> Burnout is not what will happen to us all, but burn in is guaranteed. Being aware of the burn in will let doctors continue to stand to defend what is beautiful about medicine and not burnout. The burn in is the branding of journeying fully with another human. Never should we call an end to it happening but certainly some awareness it is the by-product of medicine and some latitude to allow its’ occurrence will save more souls than the new EMR, the new phone system, a meager 12 inch cord of communication, and cost cuts and shifts.<br /><br /> Feel the burn new grad.

219	86	2	Physicians provide a value to society that cannot be cheapened	I greet the patient, and we discuss how he feels and what all is transpiring and planned for the day. He feels cold, nervous, pain in his back, not hungry, overwhelmed, and worried. I reassure and give answers and leave hope. His shoulders relax, and the blanket covering him lays more naturally at ease. That is my queue. I fold the chair back up and hang it on the wall. I walk out. The nurse says, “I’ve never seen anyone use that thing.”<br /><br /> Years later I write an article about the bedside and the physician’s need to reclaim this role more explicitly and obviously. The reality of modern medicine challenges the notion of physicians “taking back the bedside.” Time is a constraint because we are too busy to sit too long or to come back physically. The roles of physicians have expanded so sitting at the bedside is only a small visual part of what needs to be done to doctor these days.<br /><br /> Others lay claim on the bedside because they are seemingly more present and seen. Yet the bedside is something intangible. Yet physicians still have these intimate dealing with illness and death. Yet no one is talking much about the physician’s “bedside” existence with conviction. The stool stays on the wall unused. Perhaps some other kind of care provider claims the stool and places a label on it declaratively. Perhaps the stool just disappears because the bedside intangibles get completely disregarded by the evolution of modern medicine away from relationships and toward outcomes and algorithms.<br /><br /> Perhaps the word choice is wrong. Perhaps I should rally the public to see physicians at the #worryside or the #responsibleside. Perhaps this will not offend or negate all that take time at the physical bedside. Perhaps this will just emphasize better the roles physicians try and are asked to play in patient care still.<br /><br /> Physicians are currently responsible for planning and executing solutions for patient problems. I saw a rheumatologist once as a patient, and after listening to me, she said, “I want to fix you.”<br /><br /> Simply put, she was moved as all physicians are to fix problems. She invited the responsibility to achieve a fix for me. Physicians are in the end responsible. The public says they are because when things of any nature fail the physician will become the last say or the last responsible party. Physicians accept that obligation in so far as that responsibility is paid back with true regard and appreciation. It is very hard to be the bottom line. It is harder when patients are unkind and ungrateful.<br /><br /> Physicians worry a lot. We worry if someone will feel better or cope better or survive trials and disappointments. We worry we did not do enough and the right and timely thing. We worry we missed something or were misunderstood. We worry we didn’t worry enough or at times at all. Worry becomes how we know we care and caring becomes how we keep doing an intangible job with so much responsibility.<br /><br /> Worry and responsibility are fueled by living off the success of a strategic plan and the success of delivering help. We care about patient satisfaction and outcomes. We care if someone hurts or is helped so much so that someone not doing well effects us in ways scarring but someone doing well fuels us on. Ask any physician why they continue, and they will in some way say because one smile of someone doing better or an actual moment of lessened human grief, pain, burden, tension seen in a patient’s affect feels like a victory.<br /><br /> The rally for physicians to reclaim the bedside is not to exclude all that sit or care or worry. It is to refocus and reidentify what the physician is doing in patient care or rather what the physician should continue to do if the system is challenged and evolving. The bedside is intangible. For purpose of debate it can be renamed the #worryside or the #responsibleside.<br /><br /> The point is physicians provide a value to society that cannot and should not be so easily cheapened or disregarded. It is an imperative we have clear understand of what the stool in the room represents. Physicians must distinguish what they provide or perish. Upon their exit, physicians take with them a way to connect with humans that humanity cannot suffer the loss of.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />John Lambert Pearson/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 21.03.2017.

220	86	2	4 reasons why being a doctor is worth it	They do the math and continue to engage in other professions that are medical but not specifically Medical Doctorate degrees or Doctor of Osteopathic degrees. These same students conclude there is no longer a reason to choose to be a doctor because the culture seems to regard doctors less. And on top of that, the financial and physical debt incurred is harder to pay back.<br /><br /> Pre-medical students, already feeling wary of a long and stressful road ahead, question the sanity of pursuing a medical degree. This is the logical conclusion of watching all of the turbulence and frustration from the establishment.<br /><br /> Discussion groups amongst doctors entertain the question: ”Would I choose to be a doctor again?” What a daring and provocative question to ask!<br /><br /> We must be vigilant to avoid souring the future of medicine for prospects, and we need to address problems within the medical field. Let’s prevent the burgeoning ideology of young professionals that being a doctor isn’t worth it.<br /><br />Here are four reasons why being a doctor is:<br /><br />1. Becoming a doctor has long been an esteemed honor. As experts in science, biology, wholeness and wellness, doctors remain influential members of society. And they will continue to be the foremost authority on health and wellness for a long time.<br /><br />2. Doctors invite themselves to experience other’s vulnerability. It’s an honor to be so intimately involved and dedicated to the exploration of creating well-being.<br /><br />3. A doctor not only experiences the health and wellness of their patients but their sickness and ultimate death. This glimpse at mortality and the fragility of life that hone efforts to sanctify life and progress society. This awareness allows doctors to influence society for the better.<br /><br />4. Doctors are part of a community which fosters support and creates social awareness that, indeed, doctors need rest just like anyone else.<br /><br /> Medical students need our reassurance that they will be rewarded and regarded. They need our efforts to secure their commitments with meaning. They also need our reflections on the incredible and very honorable role we serve to our society. Such an honor and promise of mastery and lifetime productivity and trusted intimacy is no small feat for the weak. It is for the exemplary students with the biggest hearts. It is for wisest and most compassionate that we hope are attracted to our profession.<br /><br /> Would you select medicine again? Would you advise the brightest students to our order?<br /><br /> Be an instrument of changes as much as you are a tool of inspiration, lest we all suffer without guidance and care and the best on our side.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />wobogre/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 28.02.2017.

221	86	2	Physicians are the emotional punching bags of society	In the end, Dr. Stein concludes, “At the moment, the best answer to the kindness contrarian is: Even if the evidence in favor of the therapeutic benefits of empathy is weak, there is no evidence that refutes the idea that empathy improves care. And too many patients have stories of how unkindness or the sheer obliviousness of doctors can be devastating and indelible.”<br /><br /> If the value of empathy and kindness from a physician is debatable and difficult to assess, I challenge the opposing paradigm that asks, “We all want to help kind people. But does a kind patient get better care?”<br /><br /> I was rounding for the first time on a man admitted for decompensated congestive heart failure. He had cycled through volume overload then acute renal failure then volume overload four times in three months. I called his caretaker to ask a few clarifying questions. I immediately encountered the wrath of frustration and distrust that predated my meeting this patient by three months.<br /><br /> The two initial encounters occurred at another hospital, and there was great animosity because of that hospital’s “failings.” Needless to say, there was swearing and accusations, and I fell silent and felt unjustly held accountable for perceived failings. I became weak with humanity and felt defensive arms rise. I had to restrain my harsh objections and calm the moment despite my bruised intentions. It drained me to deal with this pent up anger, and when I hung up, I had less left to joyfully care about the ill man. I came ready to care. I was beaten to indifference. I continued on by duty but lost a taste for righteousness.<br /><br /> The next day my partner recanted a story of a person demanding to have her fill out forms for family medical leave for the person’s grandmother immediately. Apparently, my partner had never met the spouse of her patient and this person who was demanding forms “this instant” was the girlfriend of the grandson. My partner shared how suddenly very on guard she felt with the expectations shoved at her under such claims.<br /><br /> It has become expected that physicians and care systems should provide customer service and be kind, yet the same discussion that asserts and mandates patients and their families be gracious and polite seems to be taboo. Asking for patients to be courteous and recognize the well intentions of a physician seems an audacious and self-righteous request. Where is the sign that says, “We reserve the right to refuse service” in this arena of customer care? The atmosphere has positioned physicians who dedicated their lives to caring to be instead the emotional punching bags of society.<br /><br /> Physicians sustain verbal assaults and take on the weight of disappointments, failings, and the often unstoppable rape of disease and illness. In some insidious way, that reality is becoming acceptable. The ill have claim on physicians. I challenge that such claim to allow abuse and dispense abuse without regard will affect care. Physicians do not want to be judgmental or succumb to the weakness of bruised feeling but how would a human soul not be altered by engaging distasteful personas?<br /><br /> At the moment, the best answer to the patient kindness contrarian is: Even if the evidence in favor of the therapeutic benefits of patients being kind is weak, there is no evidence that refutes the idea that it is easy to care for a kind patient. And too many physicians have stories of how unkindness or the sheer abuse of doctors can be devastating to the patient.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />harutmovsisyan/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 07.02.2017.

222	86	2	Physicians will rise to take back the bedside	In his essay, he claimed the identity of a physician was being “killed” by the reality of practice demands. The essay referenced an image of the essence of doctoring seemingly outdated pictured in a painting “The Doctor” by Sir Luke Fildes. In 1877 Sir Luke Fildes’ first son fell ill, and the doctor who tended to him sat at his bedside anxious and unable to help more than to worry and care. The painter and his wife were touched by this deeply. When commissioned to paint any image of his choosing, Sir Luke Fildes created this image of a doctor “doctoring” his loved one.<br /><br /> Medicine has evolved by advances away from art and thus humanity. Penicillin was discovered in 1928 and was not used medicinally till 1942. Medicine in 70 years evolved and doctors learned procedure and over 4,000 drugs now exist which doctors are asked to know the names, usage, dosage, side effects, and contraindications to. The business of medicine has overshadowed the nature of care and left those with the calling in their hearts confused and disenchanted.<br /><br /> Dr. Walter Lawrence Jr., a 90 year old physician entering medical school in 1944, wrote in a letter addressing medical students in June of 2016 his reflection on the evolution of doctoring saying, “Well, consider that there were no available antibiotics for life-threatening infections before penicillin, which came on the scene around that time; no medicines for the control of high blood pressure, other than sedatives; and very limited medical approaches to failing hearts, kidneys and livers. Operations were both hazardous and limited in scope, and physicians’ care was often limited to providing empathy — as was so well-documented in the old Norman Rockwell paintings showing the kindly doctor at the sick patient’s bedside.”<br /><br /> The change in medicine is felt in the atmosphere of practice and in the deep roots of training. Trainees are catching disenchantment like a virus. An anonymous essay by a medical student published March of 2016, “A star medical student feels like he made a terrible decision,” expressed how the student had realized a terrible mistake had been made in the long hard climb to be a physician. “One might think that at this point in my life, I should feel confident, well-accomplished, and hopeful for the future. In the last month, there’s been a lot of talk about residency and deciding on a specialty. To me, this meant finally looking back onto my life, my experiences, and all that medicine has meant for me. And I can’t help but feel that I have made a terrible, terrible decision,” the student wrote. Nearly 3K shares may speak of a common sentiment.<br /><br /> Society is trying to decipher the value of the old image and definition of doctoring. On August 11, 2016, Dr. Michael Stein wrote an article in the Washington Post asking if “kindness actually helped get us well.” His conclusion is weak for evidence but strong for both a non-inferior perhaps even arguably a moral correctness towards humanity supporting empathy in medicine. “Kindness carries with it a commitment to a certain way of thinking and being rather than a particular pre-defined endpoint,” Dr. Stein contemplated. It is this certain way of thinking that creates the end point for individuals patients.<br /><br /> Despite the heartache, tens of thousands of physicians in practice would choose medicine again. Among the reasons why is the deeply moving connection to the actualization of very delicate and very specific moments at the patient’s bedside that doctoring affords.<br /><br /> What is depicted in the archaic imagery by Sir Luke Fildes is not dead. It remains the very ethos of medicine. Care is the highest commodity of a doctor. It is care coupled with knowledge born of experience and authority that is doctoring.<br /><br /> Intimate stories are happening right now and through their actualizations and sharing physicians can rebuke the current evolution away from the true ethos of medicine and regain the identity of healer.<br /><br /> Physicians should not fight politicians or economists or insurance companies. Physicians should carry on business as usual having and sharing moments of intimacy to remind society what they truly seek in a doctor. Our seat at the table of humanity is not for meager notions but for the delicate survival of humanity.<br /><br /> The doctor is in. The doctor is not dead in you or me. The doctor will not die of this disease of suffocation and smear. We will sit at the bedside because after 70 years we still don’t have all the answers and people still need us there.<br /><br /> If 27K shares say doctoring is dead to ring an alarm, then 100K shares should say physicians will rise to take back the bedside.<br />  <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Abi Skipp/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 23.12.2016.

223	86	2	This story shows the humanity of medicine	“Oh, hello Doctor,” he said with a little relief, a little surprise, a little delight in his voice. “I’m doing OK. I walked the dog today.”<br /><br /> “Mr. Bertsie. Did everything go ok yesterday?” I pressed.<br /><br /> “Oh yes. They were all very nice and got me right in. I am glad to be done with it,” he confessed.<br /><br /> The day before he was an add-on to remove his hemodialysis catheter. They had placed it quickly to start him on dialysis not but four days before but then he suddenly changed his mind and decided against dialysis. I had made a lot of phone calls that day to have the dialysis catheter removed and was glad to hear it was taken out kindly, and he was treated well.<br /><br /> “I wanted to thank you for all you have done, Dr. Robey,” he began. I started to cry. I wanted to stop him because these words were the beginning of the last he would speak to me.<br /><br /> “It’s been my pleasure, sir. I respect your decision, and I know it was hard to know what to do.” I was holding back tears to speak clearly.<br /><br /> “I just think enough is enough and it’s OK really,” he said calmly and casually. “I’ve lived a good life,” he pondered. “Dr. Robey, I mean to ask you. What happens now? What … what exactly happens now? How long do I …”<br /><br /> “I understand, sir,” I interrupted. “You are different than the usual kidney failure patient. You don’t have kidney failure solely or primarily. You have cardiorenal syndrome and with that, it is more a relationship issue between the heart and kidney. Your heart and kidneys fail together. It may take weeks to months but usually within a month, and mostly you will grow more tired, “ I answered. The answers to such questions are so long and winding. I worried I lost him and thought perhaps I should have had his wife on the line too.<br /><br /> Silence presented itself as his mind conceived each grain of sand of dying’s hourglass.<br /><br /> “I want to thank you again,” he said. I felt his entire being press up against mine and my eyes flooded. It was like a hug across the phone line.<br /><br /> “Mr. Bertsie, I want to thank you. You’ve been such a delight to me,” I reached out and held on for a little longer.<br /><br /> My patients were now waiting two at a time, and I was pressed for time. I wanted to take the day off and stare at a wall. I wanted to stop losing friends but had many friends to still engage and travel with properly just down the hall.<br /><br /> Mr. Bertsie said quietly, “Well doc, goodbye.”<br /><br /> “Goodbye, Mr. Bertsie,” I trailed off and hung up. My day went on as planned but I was distracted. I learned long ago to admit to the distraction, so patients knew I did not mean to be rude but only wanted to be allowed to be human.<br /><br /> For weeks I carried a heavy heart and then I heard from his wife. She was driving with her son to look at funeral homes.<br /><br /> “Dr. Robey, thank you for taking this call,” Mrs. Bertsie said on the phone over the rush of street noises.<br /><br /> “Bernard is just at home in bed asleep mostly. He is not eating anything. He is moaning at times. He seems to smile if I touch him.”<br /><br /> “Is he comfortable?” I asked.<br /><br /> “I think so. Do you think Dad is comfortable? “ she turned to ask her son who was driving. “My son says he thinks so. What I wanted to ask you about is well … what to expect and well … when?”<br /><br /> Again the weight of the uncertainty laid on me to rectify and the length of the explanation choked me. That feeling was a strange barrier to crying.<br /><br /> I took a breath and then began as I had with her husband. “Well at this point he isn’t eating or drinking, and the focus is making him comfortable. You can stop the diuretics and pills and only use the sublingual morphine. The time is short, but I can’t tell you exactly when. Maybe the next 12 to 48 hours. What you and your son are doing now is very important. Once that is done, you should just be with him. Contact any family you have and let them come to see him if they want.”<br /><br /> I heard Mrs. Bertsie choke up. My long explanation managed to wrap around her throat and throw her down the precarious edge she was on.<br /><br /> “I see,” she managed.<br /><br /> I had promised them both a year ago when I was late coming in to see them dealing with another sad case that all things come full circle. “One day if you need the time I will be there for you,” I guaranteed.<br /><br /> She referenced this now. “You said you would take the time with us if ever we needed you like you did that day you took with someone else and was a little late coming in. I know you are busy. I won’t keep you. Thank you for all you did for Bernard. He really loved you.”<br /><br /> I lost it.<br /><br /> I hung up with a soft goodbye and left the equinox knowing Mr. Bertsie would soon pass. Grieving like this was hard. I sat back in my office chair. I heard the charts being placed in the exam doors.<br /><br /> I heard the next morning Mr. Bertsie passed that night in his bed at home with his family by his side. I hoped his face was soft, and his skin so bruised by blood thinners and poking stopped weeping and laid against soft satin.<br /><br /> The equinox is a certain place a doctor and a patient or the patient’s family goes. It only invites this relationship in. The deep sadness we feel there shows the light of humanity onto medicine.<br /><br /> Our only reason to embrace grief is to enter the next room and next relationship with heart.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Unsplash/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 28.11.2016.

224	86	2	Welcome to the Medical Profession	You undoubtably were more mature than your peers. You undoubtably sacrificed to develop the persona that one day would impress a high order to accept you. You sacrificed pieces of your life often happily often with a greater goal and delayed gratification. You approached life with determination and a steady anxiety. You felt a pull and pushed through long nights and the stress. You stacked classes and activities and leadership roles into a delicate Jenga. You volunteered. You studied into long hours and said no to frivolous things long before others did. You welcomed over and over being weighed and measured, and you wanted to come up tall and solid. There are constant intervals where you are merely preparing for the next test or next evaluations. This has been going on for years.<br /><br /><br /> We were looking for leaders. People with maturity beyond their years. People capable of composure and alertness under a thick air of fatigue and uncertainty. People with good judgment and critical acumen. We needed members for a tribal counsel and representatives of compassion and humanity. We asked you to be nonjudgmental. To write well. To communicate well. To exercise constraint tolerance and the highest aptitude for memory and cognitive synthesis. We needed thinkers doers and teachers. We wanted innovators. We expected you would sign your name over and over and when asked who will take responsibility you would not cower.<br /> We screened thousands. We denied thousands. The fraternity tries to pass a torch only to those who can hold a war path against illness.<br /><br /><br /> Today we are told we were not so meticulously screened. That we did not perspire or cry. That we somehow just got lucky and are replaceable at the table discussing humanity. We humble ourselves to bear the weight of a broken system. We question each other. We question ourselves. It is in the way they talk to us refer to us and describe what we do in terms of smallness and simpleness.<br /><br /><br /> We were born leaders. We were selected by those that came before us with expectations we could command the orchestra of things that battles illness away. We are not average in ability nor in the kind of courage that gets someone a medical degree.<br /><br /><br /> We remember it took all we had to arrive here.<br /><br /><br /> I know you will get tired and need to refuel. I know you will be ill too or broken one day. That is OK and allowed. We are not gods. We follow normal human needs and wants. But don’t ever forget how hard it was to come this far and how you are stronger than most. This is part why training is the way it is. We are making you more able. We need you to be able to function hungry tired taxed. We need you able to forgive trespasses and absorb insults and try always to do the right thing. We ask of you much, but we know you have it to give till you don’t.<br /><br /><br /> We will support you when you don’t have it.<br /><br /><br /> We have invested in you.<br /><br /><br /> Do not allow the failings of few in our order so widely publicized to strip you of your calling rights and dues. You are truly more able than those around you to help humanity. We saw this potential. We found it of the utmost nobility.

225	87	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	623	m2m
226	90	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

227	90	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

228	90	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

229	91	2	Little girl injured by a land mine	"The mine that injured her was the type ""butterfly"". The girl climbed over the fir cones under fir trees in one of the central areas of Donetsk. Of course, the upholders of the Ukrainian government would say that mine has been planted by ""terrorists."" Another concerned person of this incident is the older brother of the girl - he also got injured by the land mine.<br /><br /> Their mother came to me for a doctor's note for her 14-year-old daughter who took care of her 5-year-old sister in the hospital. The mother had to take care of her one-month-old baby and therefore she could take care of her other daughter in the surgical department.<br /><br /> The Children's Hospital has the most necessary medicine. In pharmacies they have a few drugs that got a lot more expensive. The government of DPR (Donetsk People Republic) began with payments, but these payments do not correspond to the higher prices. However, it is better than no payments from the Ukraine (Ukrainian government stopped all kinds of payments – pension, benefits, salaries in August 2014. How did people survive? Only they know…).<br /><br /> Prices for everything - medicines, food and other goods also got more expensive due to the ongoing Ukrainian blockade of Donetsk. Some supermarket chains closed because of this blockade.<br /><br /> On the photo above this blog entry you can see a house which I pass on my way to work. It is damaged by shelling, some windows are smashed, some windows are sealed with adhesive tape - it saves you from broken glass and people say it even helps to preserve the glass (my windows are also sealed - but with transparent tape). But residents continue to grow flowers on window sills and under the window.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 02.06.2015."	Dr. med. Oksana Zhurbij	2015-05-19 00:00:00	2974	m2m
230	91	2	About the importance of measles vaccination	"A personal acquaintance that had measles completely convinced me of the need for vaccination.<br /><br /> I have a very personal relationship with this infection:<br /> When I was a child measles vaccine was administered at the age of 1 year and 16 years.<br /><br /> I got the vaccination aged 1 year... But the group of silly 16-year-old schoolgirls was scared of injections and refused vaccination.<br /><br /> When my son was 1 year he got his measles vaccine. I was 24, I was a medical intern and we conducted all vaccinations. Exactly a month after his vaccinations I became ill with measles. It was as follows: I was in the theater, listening to ""La Traviata"" and after the spectacle I barely could get home because I was feeling so bad.<br /> The last thing I remember that this night I was trying to take aspirin and dropped the kettle because my hands were shaking. The next 10 days, I do not remember anything.<br /><br /> They said that I was woken up by a fever. I received an injection antipyretic and 15 minutes later I went back to sleep for 2-3 hours until the next temperature rise. Skin rash appeared on me and I had all the symptoms:  Small, flat blotches that blended into one another. My cheeks and forehead were reddened first. Then the rash spread down the arms and trunk, then over the thighs and legs. The rash disappeared in the same order, but pigment spots still remained for a long time - at least a month.<br /><br /> Fortunately, I have not had measles encephalitis. But I did have measles pneumonia. I caught measles from a neighbor who lived on the floor above. My son didn’t fall sick with measles.<br /><br /> Of course, in addition to the rash and fever I had all other measles symptoms – dry cough (very painful), runny nose, sore throat and conjunctivitis. But I do not know if I had Koplik spots - tiny white papules that are on the inner lining of the cheek in the first 1-2 days of the illness.<br /><br /> Commonly, the measles virus incubates without signs for the first 10 to 14 days after a person is infected. Often measles begin like a normal cold and only after 2-3 days the typical rash appears on the skin. Koplik spots often stay unnoticed.<br /><br /> A person with measles spreads the virus for about 8 days – approximately 4 days before the rash appears and 4 days after. Complications of measles may include the following: ear infection, bronchitis, laryngitis, croup, pneumonia, encephalitis, pregnancy problems - pregnancy loss, preterm labor or low birth weight, and thrombocytopenia.<br /><br /> The main risk factor of measles is for unvaccinated persons, especially young children. The measles virus is highly contagious spread by coughing and sneezing.<br /><br /> In order to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks WHO recommends administrating 2 doses of vaccine.<br /><br /> Immunization against measles for one child costs about US $1.Unfortunately, we have no vaccines since July. The war...<br /><br /> Measles - one of the diseases in which the group’s immunity is particularly important. The presence of a pool of vaccinated immune people prevents the spread of the virus.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Maria Bobrova/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 21.04.2015."

231	91	2	Life as a doctor in a shelled area in Ukraine	"It is very, very scary, when you hear the shot and then the packet’s whistle and then – explosion. If an explosion is far - 500 meters is far – you can hear just sharp sounds and you can continue doing your thing. If your windows shakes – you should go to the hallway.<br /><br /> If the whole house shakes – you must run to the hallway, lie on the floor and wish that the next packet will not come to you.<br /><br /> Every day. Every night. At every moment the shell can fly to your home and destroyed it, kill you or your family.<br /><br /> After such a night you go to work. A shell can fly on the bus or to the bus stop. Your husband wishes you won't go to work but you get salary albeit 2 months delayed. Your family needs this money - it is the only income. Ukrainian government refused to pay pensions to people who had been working in Ukraine all their lives.<br /><br /> Ukrainian checkpoints do not miss to control the city trucks with food and medications. Insulin, antibiotics, antipyretics, antihypertensive, anticonvulsants became scarce and very expensive.<br /><br /> After the doctor’s appointments I go on home visits. The air is abuzz with gunfire and explosions. I walk past five-storey buildings in which glass is about to fall out. Scary.<br /><br /> One day, the bus came directly under firing. Between the two explosions I could leap out and fall under the garage wall. Before the next explosion, I managed to go down into the cellar of the nearby house. I stood there, pressed against the wall and could only think of the fact that the shells explode close to where my home is. And that my husband and son were there. As soon as the shelling ended I ran home. We took all our animals (our doggy, two zebra finches, budgie, three chinchillas (one was only a few days) and moved into my mother's place to a more quiet area. More quiet area means that the buildings are not shaking from the explosions there.<br /><br /> We waited for the announced February 15 truce. These two weeks especially the last days before the February 15 were very scary. The city was trembling from explosions. The factory where my son works as veterinary doctor (in the factory zoo) was shelled. My son has outlasted shelling in the cellar and then bandaged the wounded at the entrance of the factory. At the same time, in the morning,  a bus station was shelled, two drivers and several passengers were killed.<br /><br /> Finally, we have lived to silence. Sometimes the shellings begin again but they are weaker.<br /><br /> Products are very grew and they became less. Medications are still scarce. Ukraine blocks Donetsk and we often remember the blockade of Leningrad. Ukrainians tell us that we deserved shelling and blockade because we voted at a referendum and expressed our opinion. All this is happening in the 21st century, in a country that calls itself democratic and whose leaders claim that they are Europeans.<br /><br /> According to the UN about 5,000 civilians were killed during the war in the Donbass. In fact, that number is 10 times more.<br /><br />The President of Ukraine said about the inhabitants of Donetsk: ""Their children will sit in cellars."" The Ukrainian government is trying to implement a program of their President.<br /><br /> Earth, Europe, Ukraine, Donbass, 21st Century.<br />Article last time updated on 09.03.2015."	Dr. med.

232	91	2	Unusual rash	It was a very unusual rash. There were small (up to 5 mm long) blisters at the edges of both palms and soles of my little patient. It could not be chicken pox since the patient had that a year ago.<br /> Maybe it was an allergic reaction, but to what allergen? What changed in the girl's environment or diet?<br /> The mother mentioned that new sand was brought to the kindergarten's sandboxes the day before they consulted me. However, I asked myself why her daughter’s throat was red while doing a home visit and examining the girl (in our medical culture, home visits are standard for routine complaints).<br /> The mother's main concern was if it was okay to send the girl back to kindergarten tomorrow.<br /> I actually didn’t know. Two days before there was nothing on her skin, then wheals appeared and turned into blisters the next day. She already had chickenpox. Her throat was red. She had no fever, her temperature was normal. The rash did not itch.<br /> I told the mother I didn’t know what it was.  I told her: “Let me examine her again tomorrow and also get CBC tomorrow morning please, so I can see the results in the afternoon.”<br /> CBC was compatible with a viral infection. There were no cells pathognomic for an acutely allergic state.<br /> Then, during the re-exam, I saw new sore spots in her mouth.<br /> A few days later, a 3-year-old boy who lives nearby, developed similar symptoms.<br /> It turned out there were more than 50 of such cases that autumn.<br /> I think that it was the hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which is a mild viral exanthem. It is usually young children that are affected. It is considered to be caused by a coxsackievirus.<br /> This virus spreads orally by airborne contamination, by contact with nasal secretions, saliva, weeping blisters, droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or a sneeze, or by stool particles because young children often put their fingers in their mouth. Sometimes, adults are infected without symptoms and pass the virus to others.<br /> There is no specific treatment for hand-foot-and-mouth disease since it is self-limited. Intervention is necessary only if the child has difficulties eating because of oral lesions or when the child's condition gets worse and complications show.<br /> For preventing hand-foot-and-mouth disease good hygiene is effective.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kmrep/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 20.01.2015.

233	91	2	One of my working days	"Some patient voices:<br /><br />Patient: ""May I come in?""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Welcome, come in, what happened to you?""<br /><br />Patient: ""I want you to put my child on record. We moved here.""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Okay. Let's get his medical records. Where are you from?""<br /><br />Patient: ""Kremlin Avenue.  (Settlement October mine*).""<br /><br /><br /> Patients come from everywhere: Petrovka*, Spartac*, Putilovka*, again Putilovka*, Gornyak (Miner)*, Azotniy*, Putilovka*, Petrovka*, Krasnogorovka*, Avdeevka*.<br /> In the early summer many people were from Mar’inka* - and they all remained here, in my district.<br /> Their voices are ringing from tears:<br /><br />  ""Our house is intact yet, my mother’s house down the street was demolished.""<br /><br />  ""Blown.""<br /><br />  ""Today I went after things - again, barely managed to escape.""<br /><br />  ""When a house next door blew off the roof, I decided to leave.""<br /><br />  ""Our house burned down. (Mother and her five-year-old daughter are laughing). The main thing is that we are safe and rescued the cat."" (A clever mother, well done. Her daughter hasn’t got post-traumatic neurosis)<br /><br />  ""We were shelled every day, I cannot stand it any longer.<br /><br />  <br /><br />""I'm afraid even to send him (the son) to school.""<br /><br />  ""Don't be afraid, it's quiet here. Not a single shell splinter fell.""<br /><br />""All the same, I'm afraid, I'm afraid of any noise.""<br /><br />  <br /><br />  Patient: ""We do not have the medical records, will you take us?""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Don't worry, I'll take you. We’ll make new records, get the paperwork to the school and kindergarten. Everything will be solved.""<br /><br />  <br /><br />  Other patient: ""We have moved, will you take us?""<br /><br /> I don't send them to the chief, as I should. I just type them in the census, take the records if they have one and make new records for those who haven't.<br /> In my opinion, they are already more than those who left early in the summer.<br /> Today: another shelling. Nothing special. This is a routine district doctor’s work in a city which is shelled on a daily basis.<br /> The area where my doctor's district is located is one of the few without shelling. I go to work with the sounds of cannon fire. The Government of Ukraine said that they won't pay our salaries. This means 150€ per month and less for me.<br /> Maybe, I should explain you something regarding the features of ukranian medical care.<br /> Our government started the reform of medical care. Most therapists and pediatricians were retrained to family physicians. But most of us are trying to work in their specialty – and our bosses are trying to help us in this (if they are smart bosses), because it is very difficult to change the speciality after 23 years of work.<br /> District pediatrician should observe at least 800 children. Family doctors – 1,400 adults and children. We had enough doctors before but some doctors left the city because of the war, so I am working on three districts - for three doctors. I should observe, do routine exams (monthly children under one year and annually up to 18 years), vaccinate, diagnose and treat 2,400 children (in fact they are a little less - about 2,000). And I have to go to the call and patronage (four times in first month of life, twice – doctor and twice - nurse) to their home.<br /> And of course I should write a lot of records and reports - at least 5 per examination of the patient and 5 monthly.<br /> * - names of villages, towns and urban areas, which are shelled on a daily basis.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2014."

234	91	2	Low-grade fever as beginning of duodenal ulcer	Her mother has been taking her to many doctors. The girl was seen by an endocrinologist, an otolaryngologist, a neurologist- in short, by all possible medical specialties whom the mother found, who had remained in the city under siege at that time (most of the physicians fled the bombings). Why so many specialists? Because our patients are accustomed to running for a specialist. They apparently think that any generalist – a pediatrician, an internist, a family physician – is like a low-level medical manager, a gate-keeper, that he or she is good for requesting tests and consults, especially where free medicine is concerned - if invalids, pensioners and their relatives will request it and persist.<br /><br /> But let us get back to my patient.<br /><br /> She had endured a lot of testing – all results were nonrevealing, normal. The specialists, one and all, zoomed in on the most “fashionable” diagnosis of exclusion - autonomic dysfunction. However, each of the physicians prescribed some medication or other just in case – iodine, sedatives, vitamins, supplements, immunostimulants and homeopathy. The girl’s mother bought them all and gave them to the child - whose condition did not improve.<br /><br /> After a long interview I found out that the girl is experiencing nausea every morning. She also complained of stomach ache – without any connection to food intake.<br /><br /> Pain in epigastric and paraumbilical regions was elicited on palpation.<br /><br /> I offered the treatment of gastritis without H.pylori therapy, and gastric imaging by endoscopy - however, the family refused the latter.<br /><br /> The girl did well with treatment, however her symptoms were still occasionally recurring.<br /><br /> In a couple of weeks, I persuaded them to do FGDS. It was indeed a duodenal bulb ulcer. This time I prescribed eradication.<br /><br /> The girl is doing well, but continues to have occasional low-grade fevers. What is it? The ulcer not entirely healed? An infection? Thermoneurosis, an enteric dysregulation?<br /><br /> I cannot evaluate this, because the only children's hospital with relevant clinic capabilities was damaged during the shelling, and cannot be used.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />hemeroskopion/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 06.11.2014.

235	91	2	Routine district doctor's work in a shelled city	"The child's  mother tried to find a pediatrician, but  she said, “There is a lock on the clinic door, and there is no one”, in a war-riddled town.  So she gave the girl  an antipyretic, and blamed teething for the fevers. <br /><br /> The  mother talked about this to her friend – an older and a more experienced woman - and this friend found me through Facebook.<br /><br /> I am a pediatrician and a family physician, I work in another clinic,  in a different medical district. <br /><br /> I should not have taken on this child's case,  according to the rules of our healthcare system, crossing the borders of regional providers. Yet,  we really did not have enough doctors in the area,  because of the war-related closing of most clinics. <br /><br /> The baby's general exam was within normal - she was an active, cheerful child. Her gums were pink, not swollen - so the ""teething"" hypothesis was not confirmed.  The nasopharyngeal exam was normal as well. This child had no evidence of an upper respiratory infection.  I have ordered urine and blood screening tests.<br /><br /> The mother returned from the laboratory discouraged:  the technicians told her that they did not have the chemicals needed to do the panel I ordered, they could only do ""the minimal three"" - the leukocyte count, hemoglobin, and ESR.<br /><br /> - Whatever I can get, - I thought...<br /><br /> Hemoglobin was normal, WBC - 11 , ESR – 15, both elevated. <br /><br /> Urinalysis revealed  proteinuria, leukocyturia, multiple squamous epithelial cells.<br /><br /> “A kidney infection?” – I thought.<br /><br /> After that I hit upon the idea to ask the mother about the living conditions at her home. She told me that for the last month they had been living in a basement - it was used as a bomb shelter. They live next to the recently bombed City Youth Center, with daily shellings nearby.  In the basement it was cold and damp.<br /><br /> This connected the dots for me: despite all the efforts of the mother, the baby was in a chilly and damp area, possibly on a cold floor -  and kidney infection in infants may be asymptomatic, except for fever, in this case.<br /><br /> Appropriate treatment  was effected, and it helped -  in 10 days there was no fever, and the urinalysis normalized. <br /><br /> Nothing special. This is a routine district doctor’s work in a city which is shelled on a daily basis.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />John Kelly/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 06.10.2014."	Dr. med.

236	92	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	623	m2m
237	95	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

238	95	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

239	95	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

241	97	2	Episode 3: The Prior Authorization Games: Where the Odds are Never in Your Favor	"In this episode, I chronicle some of my latest and most flabbergasting interactions with the insurance companies when requesting “prior authorization” for necessary medical care for my patients.<br />  <br /><br /> First, a quick explanation of the title of this post series (be sure to read Episode 1 and Episode 2, if you missed them):<br /><br /> Just like in The Hunger Games, in The Prior Authorization Games, doctors are pitted in unwilling (verbal) battle against their peers.  Our arena?  The insurance company.  Extreme analogy, you say?  While we are not battling to the death (at least, not yet), we are fighting for the lives of our patients.  And this is not fiction, it is reality.  A few case examples will follow:<br /><br /> Case #1*:<br /><br /> My patient is a woman in her mid-forties with stage IV cancer, who is stable on chemotherapy. She has had stage IV cancer for several years.  With chemotherapy, her disease is in control, and she lives an active life, raising kids and continuing to work a job outside the home as well.  She required a procedure that necessitated a pause in the currently effective chemotherapy for 2 months.  Once she recovered from the procedure, we scheduled the re-start of her chemotherapy.  But her insurance company notified us that they would no longer cover the chemotherapy. I needed to do a “peer-to-peer” phone call with a physician at the insurance company.<br /><br /> This should be easy, I thought.  It was probably a matter of the initial approval date expiring.  Surely they’re not denying a currently effective therapy.  I could demonstrate that the patient was on a chemotherapy that was working against her cancer, and it should be straightforward to get it re-authorized.  It was the usual hassle of scheduling the phone call (at the convenience of the insurance company physician, not taking into account my schedule) and interrupting my time with other patients, but once on the phone I thought this one would be a slam-dunk.  I should have known better.  I should have remembered the clinician’s dogma of experience with prior authorizations:  where the odds are never in your favor.<br /><br /> As the physician on the phone said no repeatedly, I requested to know his specialty.<br /><br /> To my surprise, he said he was also a board-certified medical oncologist.<br /><br /> “Well, thank goodness!”  I said.  “This is the first time I’ve done a peer-to-peer call and actually been able to speak with a fellow oncologist.”  I went into a level of detail about the patient’s treatment that could only be appreciated by another medical oncologist.  But as I continued, he interrupted me.<br /><br /> “How did you get this chemo approved in the first place?”  he demanded.  Wait — what?  This led us to a debate about the NCCN guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) and the role of this particular chemo.<br /><br /> I finally had to interrupt.  “I think you’re missing the point – whether or not you agree academically with my choice of this chemotherapy – it is working – we have radiographic proof of response.”<br /><br /> He hemmed and hawed some more and finally, finally!, agreed to re-approve a therapeutic treatment that was working.  His last words stuck in my mind.  He ultimately decided he “could live with” my choice for the patient’s chemotherapy.  At that point, I bit my tongue, because he was finally giving me an approval number, which was what I needed for my patient’s care.  Ego had no place here.  But in my head, I thought, “Oh, well, of course, that’s what’s really important here.  I’m so glad you can live with it.  Because my patient actually needs this medication to live.”<br /><br /> The recent news that a former medical director at Aetna admitted under oath that he did not look at the medical records when denying authorizations, came as no surprise to any physician in the U.S. in current practice, anywhere.<br /><br /> As I argue in Episode 1, why is the process of board certification not enough? Why does the U.S. healthcare insurance system not trust that board-certified specialists who order tests and treatments are doing so in the best interests of our patients and according to standards of care?  Why have a board certification process at all, if the ultimate decision on the approval of a test lies with a physician, often in an unrelated specialty, employed by the insurance company?<br /><br /> In both prior posts, Episode 1 and Episode 2, I give some further examples of cases, and of strategies that worked, in addition to helpful links to other posts by physicians on dealing with insurance company prior authorizations.<br /><br /> Case 2:<br /><br /> Along that line, next I want to share an excerpt from a letter that succeeded in obtaining approval for a PET scan that had been denied.  I hope this example might be helpful to my peers.  As other physicians have recommended (see again links above), citing evidence and guidelines, and pointing out the patient harm that will result from the denial by the insurance company, is often a successful strategy.<br /><br /> In this particular case*, myself and my staff had appealed on behalf of the patient for over 1 month.<br /><br /> It was imperative that we obtain a repeat PET scan to determine if the treatment was working or not.  For unknown reasons, this company would not allow a peer-to-peer call.  (That’s right — when we asked to speak to the medical director, we were refused).  They did finally say I could write a letter.  Here is an excerpt of what I wrote:<br /><br /> ""Treatment decisions for my patient hinge on whether there is interval change by PET/CT scan.<br /><br /> As per the NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2017, Invasive Breast Cancer, with NCCN Evidence Blocks, PET/CT scan is a validated measure of disease progression.  To directly quote the NCCN guidelines, “The most accurate assessments of disease activity typically occur when previously abnormal studies are repeated on a serial and regular basis.  Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time.”<br /><br /> (https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/breast_blocks.pdf)<br /><br />Your denial of the PET/CT scan, in direct contraindication of the NCCN guidelines, is hindering the care of my patient.  Already we will have to delay a treatment decision because the PET/CT scan we had scheduled for her had to be cancelled when it did not receive a prior authorization.”<br /><br /> A few days later, my staff were on the phone still trying to schedule the peer-to-peer review call for me, when, lo and behold, they were told a call would not be necessary —  the PET/CT scan was approved.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Case 3:<br /><br /> One final case example for this post.*  I was on the phone, doing yet another peer-to-peer call (does it seem like I spend a lot of time doing this?  I do!  As do all my colleagues…).  The reason for this call was to obtain prior authorization for an MRI scan for a patient with a new diagnosis of lung cancer.  It is an oncologic standard of care (and in the NCCN guidelines), to obtain an MRI of the brain at the time of diagnosis, even if the patient has no particular symptoms related to the brain.  The conversation was going around and around, as the physician I was speaking to could not seem to accept this.<br /><br /> Remembering my experience in case 1 above, I politely asked what the physician’s specialty was.<br /><br /> Cardiology, she told me.  I took a deep breath and (again, politely) explained the NCCN guidelines and rationale for staging MRI of the brain.  It was clear she did not want to approve it, but it also must have been clear to her that I was not getting off the phone without the approval.  “Fine!”  she ultimately said (angrily), and gave me the approval number.  “But I have never heard of this,” she insisted.  “Why don’t you just get a PET scan!?”**<br /><br />Thunk. <br /><br /> (sound of my forehead hitting desk).<br /><br /> *details in all cases changed to protect patient privacy<br /><br /> ** the patient did have a PET scan.  PET scans are not sufficient to stage the brain.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Posted first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br />Article last time updated on 12.03.2018."

242	97	2	Cancer survivorship: 8 key updates from the 2018 ASCO/AAFP/ACP Cancer Survivorship Symposium	"In my first year of oncology fellowship, our program director asked us a question:  what percentage of people with cancer survived 5 years or more?<br /><br /> At that time, in 2003, the answer was 60%.  I was appalled that fewer than half of us fellows, physicians embarking on a subspecialty training program to devote our careers to treating people with cancer, got the answer correct, with estimates of cancer survivorship ranging as low as 30%.  That was 2 years before the 2005 landmark Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, ""From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition.""<br /><br /> 70% of people diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. today will live 5 years or more, and that number is only expected to increase with the advent of newer therapies.<br /><br /> In the welcoming Lecture for Advancement of Cancer Survivorship Care, Dr. Patricia Ganz, recipient of the Ellen L. Stovall Award, spoke eloquently on Cancer Survivorship and Quality of Care:  A Thirty Year Journey.<br /><br /> From the founding of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (NCCS) in 1986, the advocacy-led movement that insisted we stop calling people cancer ""victims,"" but instead cancer survivors; to the 2005 IOM Lost in Transition report; to the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Oncology Care Model, Dr. Ganz outlined the challenges and opportunities in delivering high-quality survivorship care in a cancer care system in crisis.  She also delivered a moving tribute to the memory of Ellen Stovall, who she called the ""leading light and champion"" of survivorship care, and reminded us that cancer survivorship is a condition of its own.<br /><br /> As of January 2018, there are over 16 million cancer survivors in the U.S.  A cancer survivor is defined as anyone with cancer from the time of diagnosis for the balance of their life, and includes family, friends, and caregivers.<br /><br />Here are 8 takeaway updates from the Symposium:<br /><br /> 1. Survivorship matters.<br /><br /> 1.6 million people per year are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S.   By 2022, there will be at least 18 million people in the U.S. who are cancer survivors.  Yet cancer treatment usually occurs in isolation from primary health care delivery, as Dr. Ganz pointed out in her lecture.  Historically this has led to ad hoc follow up care plans, and oncologists' focus on surveillance for cancer recurrence, instead of a focus on health promotion.  Yet many (if not most) of people being diagnosed with cancer in the U.S will die of something other than cancer: with that #1 ""something other"" being heart disease.<br /><br />Dr. Julia Rowland, discussant in Oral Abstract Session B, outlined these trends, putting in context that in 1971, when Nixon declared the ""War on Cancer,"" there were only 3 million cancer survivors in the U.S., and < 50% would be expected to live 5 years or more.  Contrast that with our current 16 million survivors and 70% expected survivor rate.  As she put it, ""health promotion after cancer matters.""<br /><br /> 2.  Financial toxicity of cancer treatments causes significant morbidity.<br /><br /> A paradox of cancer survivorship care is that the increase in the number of cancer survivors coincides with the rapid rise in cancer treatment costs since the 1990s.  Healthcare trends affecting financial hardship include an increase in high deductible plans, an increase in patient cost-sharing (among insured patients), an increase in the uninsured, and an increase in ""specialty tier"" medications (for example, a 30% out-of-pocket cost for a specialty tier cancer medication costing $100,000 per year means a $30,000 per year out-of-pocket cost solely for cancer medication.  A $400,000/year cancer medication (yes, that is a real-world number) would translate to $120,000/year out-of-pocket cost).<br /><br /> The Affordable Care Act (ACA) benefited cancer survivors in many ways, including providing out-of-pocket caps, allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until the age of 26 (dependent coverage expansion), elimination of annual and lifetime coverage limits, elimination of pre-existing condition denials, and increased coverage of clinical trial participation.<br /><br /> Speakers in General Session 1:  The Economic Impact on Survivors and Caregivers, outlined these issues and gave numerous examples of the negative effects of financial toxicity:<br /><br />  Cancer survivors who file for bankruptcy have an increased mortality rate.<br /><br />  Those with financial hardship are more likely to either delay, or not fill, prescriptions.<br /><br />  Increased financial hardship has been associated with increased disparities in cancer outcomes.<br /><br />  Financial hardship is not only material, but behavioral, which in essence means people limit their care because of cost.<br /><br /> Some proposed solutions included the creation of ""financial navigators,"" more up-front discussions and disclosures to people about their realistic abilities to work during treatment and after, and the need for the workplace to ""meet people halfway"".<br /><br /> Here are some resources for patients and caregivers:<br /><br />thesamfund.org<br /><br />cancercare.org<br /><br />cancercare.org/helpinghand<br /><br />needymeds.org<br /><br />cancerandcareers.org<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 3. The number of geriatric cancer survivors is increasing exponentially.<br /><br /> By 2025, the number of cancer survivors is anticipated to outweigh the supply of oncologists.  The incidence of cancer in those over age 65 has risen by 67%.  Yet patients over age 65 represent only roughly 10% of people in clinical trials.  We cannot afford to not better study this segment of the population.  In the Keynote Lecture, Dr. Arti Hurria spoke on Survivorship Care for the Aging Population, and the need to better understand how cancer therapies might lead to a premature aging syndrome that significantly affects quality of life in the elderly treated for cancer.<br /><br /> 4. New cancer therapies are leading to new kinds of survivors.<br /><br /> The advent of newer cancer therapies such as the immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as oral targeted agents, has led to a new kind of cancer survivor, the ""on-treatment responders.""  These therapies may lead to remission, but ongoing chronic treatments.  These survivors and their families are facing a long-term unknown.<br /><br /> Oncologists are reminded to remember to include pre-treatment fertility counseling for this group of patients.<br /><br /> 5.  Psychosocial toxicities of cancer treatments remain an unmet need.<br /><br /> In 2008, the IOM report ""Cancer Care for the Whole Patient"" outlined the standard of care for psychosocial health for people with cancer.  From the depression and cognitive effects of cancer therapies, to fear of cancer recurrence, to risk of suicide, speakers at the symposium reminded us that there is an unmet need for better integrating mental health care into medical survivorship care.<br /><br /> While cancer is the #2 cause of death in the U.S., suicide remains the #10 cause of death.  Cancer increases the risk of suicide overall by 50%, with increased rates in men over women, and the highest incidences of suicide in cancer seen in pancreatic cancer, and head and neck cancers.  A struggle with functionality post-cancer treatment is another risk factor, and was identified as an unmet pyschosocial need in cancer survivors.<br /><br /> 6.  Eat less, exercise more.  And quit smoking!<br /><br /> Yes, these are all still true, and more important than ever for cancer survivors.<br /><br /> The best treatment for cancer fatigue is exercise.  Exercise leads to a decrease in symptoms of toxicity, increase in quality of life, as well as a decrease in cancer recurrence, and decrease in mortality.<br /><br /> The best diet for weight loss is still calorie restricted, for men an approximate target is 1500-1800 calories per day, and for women, 1200-1500 calories per day.  There is still no evidence for dietary supplements, and the best evidence still shows that it is best to meet vitamin and mineral needs through diet, not supplements.  What works:  a brisk walk 1 hour per day, and decreasing screen time.  The elderly should aim to increase protein to avoid loss of muscle while losing weight.  Digital health tools can help (i.e. FitBit, apps to track calories and exercise, etc).<br /><br /> Those who are diagnosed with cancer while being smokers should not have a nihilistic attitude about smoking, because smoking cessation improves outcome of cancer therapies. <br /><br /> Dr. Graham Warren, in General Session 3: Health Promotion After Cancer --  How to Move the Needle, reminded us of the cost of those who do not quit and thus fail first-line cancer treatment due to ongoing tobacco smoking:  3.4 billion dollars per year in the U.S..<br /><br /> 7. The Survivorship Care Plan is not just a piece of paper.<br /><br /> In the 2005 IOM ""Lost in Transition"" report, recommendation #2 was for a ""Survivorship Care Plan"" (SCP).<br /><br /> The basics of an SCP include 2 parts: (1)  a treatment summary, and (2) a follow-up care plan.<br /><br /> However, many barriers exist to adopting SCP's, including limitations on provider time, resources, and reimbursement.<br /><br /> Furthermore, a review of 13 randomized-control trials on the implementation of SCP's failed to show an impact on survivors quality of life.  Does this mean we should give up on SCP's?<br /><br /> The bottom line, according to the Commission on Cancer (COC) chairman, Dr. Lawrence Shulman, is that the ""SCP doesn't mean anything if it's not connected to a survivorship care program.""  In other words, it's not just about the piece of paper.<br /><br /> Dr. Shulman (and other speakers) reminded the audience that from the time of the 2005 IOM report and recommendation, nothing was happening to move the needle for survivorship care, until the 2016 COC standards (version 3.3) mandated the SCP as part of COC accreditation.  However, he acknowledged that in some circumstances the focus seems to have been lost -- that the SCP is a tool to address unmet needs of survivors about survivorship care, and that SCPs do not replace that conversation.  He stood by the COC requirement for a written SCP, because the COC standard is ""the only action that has gotten survivorship care on the radar.""<br /><br /> However, he stated there is clearly a need to link the SCP to an infrastructure to deliver survivorship care.  To address this, effective 1/1/19, the COC will add a requirement for a survivorship care coordinator.<br /><br /> 8.  To be successful, we must foster more cooperation and communication between oncologists and primary care providers.<br /><br /> Not all patients can, nor should, need to see an oncologist forever.  As stated in #3 above, by 2025, the number of cancer survivors is anticipated to outweigh the supply of oncologists. We need a triage model of care, in which low-risk patients can transition survivorship care to their PCP.  This was shown to be successful in one model of breast cancer survivorship care.<br /><br /> The SCP is the tool that is supposed to help transition survivorship care to the PCP.  Yet SCP's have to be accessible, relevant, and functional, in order to be of any use to the primary care provider.  They should be simple and confined to 1 page.  They should be easy to access and view in the EMR, and they should help clarify the role of the PCP in survivorship care.<br /><br /> If we expect our primary care colleagues to help us provide survivorship care to our patients, we need to do a better job on educating PCP's on what survivorship care is, and include this in residency training.  One successful model used a one-time 60-minute workshop on survivorship care for PCP's.<br /><br /> We need smarter follow-up, and to empower our patients.  We need to leverage technology to help achieve this.<br /><br /> By 2040, the U.S. is projected to have 26 million cancer survivors.  We will not succeed in providing adequate, yet alone high-quality, survivorship care, without the help of our Internal Medicine and Family Medicine colleagues.  Now is the time to build these collaborations and workflows.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> As a last takeaway consider this:<br /><br />Dr. Hurria pointed out during her keynote address that there is currently $35 billion in Medicare spending per year for cancer treatment, yet there are no established billing codes for survivorship care.<br /><br /> As compared to my entering oncology fellowship class fifteen years ago, oncologists have come a long way in recognizing and addressing survivorship care.  I was heartened by the number of other providers at the symposium invested in survivorship care -- from allied care providers to internists to family medicine practitioners to social workers, dieticians, physical therapists, and others.  As we move forward, let's hope the systems of care do as well, so that we are provided with the resources that will be needed for success.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Did you attend the Symposium?  Add your comments below.<br /><br />  <br /><br />published first at thehopefulcancerdoc.com<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 20.02.2018."

243	97	2	Why you might need chemotherapy after surgery: the basics of adjuvant chemotherapy.	"What is adjuvant therapy?<br /><br /> One of the most common questions I hear at an initial visit, as a medical oncologist, is:<br /><br /> “My surgeon told me she got all the cancer.  So why am I here?”<br /><br /> One of the jobs of the medical oncologist is to teach our patients that cancer is a systemic disease.<br /><br /> That means even though it started in one part of the body, there can be cancer cells in other places of the body.  That can go undetected for months or even years before they cause a problem.<br /><br /> There are therapies that we can offer, called adjuvant therapies, that can decrease the chance that those cells can grow into new tumors months, and yes, even years, later, what is called metastatic disease.<br /><br /> First, some definitions.<br /><br />“Adjuvant” = any therapy given after surgery to increase the chance of being cured after surgery.  This can include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, endocrine (hormonal) therapy, and immunotherapy.<br /><br />“Cure” = living out the rest of one’s life cancer-free and dying of something other than cancer.  (You will note that this definition means we cannot say whether one is “cured” at any timepoint prior to death from another cause.  Rather, we can estimate the likelihood one is cured.)<br /><br />“Metastases” = sites of cancer that have grown outside of the initial origin of the cancer.  This can be confusing.  I like to explain to my patients that cancer is always “named” for the site of origin.  One example is breast cancer.  If breast cancer metastasizes, (or travels, spreads), to the bone, it is not “bone cancer.”  It is breast cancer, metastatic to bone.  How do we know this?  Because if we did a biopsy, and the pathologist identifies the cells under the microscope, they are breast cancer cells, not bone cancer cells.<br /><br />“Cancer-free” = the assumption that there is no remaining or active cancer in the body.<br /><br />“Remission” = the best evidence suggests no evidence of remaining or active cancer in the body.<br /><br />Confused yet?  Let’s use a (hypothetical) example to try to make it more clear.<br /><br /> Ms. Smith is a 55 year old woman who went in for her yearly mammogram and an abnormality was found in her left breast.  Fortunately, it was small, but a biopsy showed it was cancerous.  She was referred to a surgeon who sat down with her and explained her two options for surgery, mastectomy (removal of the entire breast tissue), or breast-conserving surgery, also called “lumpectomy” (removal of only the tumor and a small portion of the breast surrounding it).  Mrs. Smith would like to preserve her breast, but she is afraid that if she does not have mastectomy, she will have a lesser chance of cure.<br /><br /> Her surgeon explains that if she chooses lumpectomy, it will be recommended to have adjuvant radiation therapy afterward, and that if she completes this, she has the same chance of cure as someone in the same situation who chooses mastectomy.  Huh?  Ms. Smith is confused.  Let’s break it down to explain why:<br /><br />  Over several decades, it was proven that more and more aggressive, extensive, and disfiguring breast surgeries, did not impact the long-term cure rates for breast cancer.  i.e., even women who had extensive removal of tissue under and around the breast, including muscle --“radical” mastectomy -- still had metastatic recurrences of breast cancer months to years later, to the surgeons’ dismay.  Ultimately, surgeons realized that breast cancer is not just a disease of the breast. If breast cancer cells have metastasized, or ‘escaped’, into the body, BEFORE the surgery, it does not matter how extensive the mastectomy is, the cancer can recur months to years later, because those cells can hide in other tissues (such as bone, bone marrow, liver), and grow new tumors months to years later.  (For an elegant in-depth discussion of the history and evolution of breast cancer surgeries, I highly recommend the book ""The Emperor of All Maladies,” by Siddhartha Mukherjee.  Don’t be put off by the size of the book, it is highly readable.  It was also made into a documentary series by PBS).<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Once this reality gained widespread acceptance, surgeons instead turned to doing SMALLER surgeries. To summarize many decades of research, the current standard of care is that a lumpectomy need only remove enough tissue to show (to the pathologist, under the microscope), that there are no cancer cells at the margin (the edge of the tissue that has been removed), and that if then paired with adjuvant radiation therapy, will have equal long-term survival rates as mastectomy.  Please note, this is key, PAIRED WITH RADIATION.  I sometimes meet patients who choose a lumpectomy, but then tell me afterward they are not going to choose the radiation.  Unfortunately, that is not how it works.  I tell my patients, IF YOU CHOOSE LUMPECTOMY, THAT MEANS YOU ARE CHOOSING ADJUVANT RADIATION.  They go together, we do not consider it optional.  (one possible exception would be a woman over age 70 with a small tumor with no high-risk features, but again that is a discussion that needs to happen between the woman and her surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist).<br /><br />   <br /><br />Whether Mrs. Smith chooses mastectomy, or lumpectomy with radiation, she will need to meet with a medical oncologist after surgery, to review her risk of future recurrence, and whether she needs adjuvant medical therapies. Let’s continue the story to illustrate this better:<br /><br /> Ms. Smith is relieved by the information and chooses lumpectomy with adjuvant radiation therapy.  (As an aside, I should mention that not all breast cancer qualifies for lumpectomy – this should always be a discussion between a woman and her surgeon – but some factors that can disqualify a woman from being a candidate from lumpectomy can include (and are not limited to) a very large tumor and/or more than one tumor in the breast).<br /><br /> She does well with surgery, and at her post-op visit, her surgeon explains that she ""got it all"" and the ""lymph nodes are clear.""  Ms. Smith is relieved and prepares herself for the next step of her post-lumpectomy radiation, but then she is alarmed and confused when her surgeon recommends, and sets up a consultation with, a medical oncologist.<br /><br />The first thing she says to the medical oncologist is, ""My surgeon said she got it all, so I don't even know why I'm here.""<br /><br /> Here's what I tell my patients:<br /><br /> Breast cancer, like most all cancers, is tricky.  It can be sneaky.  Even small tumors, not in the lymph nodes, (stage I), have a small risk of recurrence over time.  For hormonally sensitive breast cancer (often referred to as ""ER - positive"", ER = estrogen receptor), this risk persists for life.  (A recent NEJM meta-analysis of over 60,000 women with breast cancer sheds more evidence on this).  I tell my patients that I do not tell them this to frighten them, but to empower them to make the best medical decisions for themselves.<br /><br /> I would explain to Ms. Smith that taking a pill medication with overall low rate of side effects once per day for the next 5 years would lower her risk of the breast cancer coming back by about 50%, and lower the risk of dying from breast cancer by 30%.  I would also explain that it is not a guarantee; unfortunately a small number of women could still relapse, and even die from breast cancer, despite taking the anti-estrogen pill.  Our job as medical oncologists is to advise our patients when they are in a high enough risk group of that happening, that taking several months of chemotherapy after surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy) would be ""worth it"" to lower their risk. (i.e. the potential life-saving benefits outweigh the potential risks of treatment).<br /><br /> Historically, the main predictors of risk of relapse and metastases were anatomic - the size of the tumor and whether or not there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes.  More and more however we are learning that the risk is not always tied to anatomic features - sometimes cancers can be small in size, but aggressive in behaviour - and again, it is our job as medical oncologists to analyze and interpret the findings of the pathology report to advise our patients.<br /><br /> Ms. Smith is relieved to learn her risk of recurrence is overall low, but upset to hear that the risk is not zero.  She wants to know why there isn't a scan or blood test that could be done to determine if she needs chemotherapy.<br /><br /> This is a great question, and there is quite a bit of research working on a blood test, but that is likely still years away.  In the meantime we do have some risk-stratifying tests that can be run on the tumor tissue (beyond the scope of this post - I think I'll have to devote another post just to this topic), and we, as medical oncologists, will advise our patients when we think those tests should be done.<br /><br /> But as for scans, they will not help us, as we are talking about treating microscopic cancer cells -- not possible to see on CT scans or PET scans. (or MRI, or ultrasound, or any other imaging test).<br /><br /> So to conclude the story:  Ms. Smith and her medical oncologist decide together that her breast cancer is in a low enough risk group that she would not necessarily benefit from chemotherapy.  She proceeds to her radiation therapy treatments, and when they are completed, she will return to her medical oncologist to start her endocrine adjuvant therapy (the anti-estrogen pill).<br /><br /> While this example focused on breast cancer, we have these same discussions every day with patients with almost all other types of cancer after surgery.  For each person, we use all the available clinical data to make a risk assessment, but we also take into account each person's age, health, level of function, living situation, goals, and support system, before making a recommendation.  This is what we mean when we say we individualize the cancer care.  Expect this visit to last 45-60 minutes (or even longer), and believe that your oncologist has spent already that same amount of time, or more, analyzing your case, and talking with your surgeon.<br /><br /> If you are reticent to meet with a medical oncologist, I hope this article will help change your mind.  At the least, try to go into the appointment with an open mind.  Even if it is not the news you want to hear, if your medical oncologist recommends adjuvant treatments, they are doing so with your best long-term interests in mind, which is to give you the best chance of cure.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  This is by no means an exhaustive coverage of this topic (which would be impossible to do in under1800 words), nor is this meant in any way to be used as medical advice.  Please see full site disclaimers on the about me page.<br /><br />Published first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br /><br /> Image Copyright (outer article): Anna_Sunny/pixabay/CC0<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />The Hopeful Cancer Doc <br />Article last time updated on 08.02.2018."

244	97	2	My Mom is a Doctor, My Dad is a Dad.	“My dad usually stays home and cleans up, and takes care of the pets.”<br /><br /> I thought for a moment. “That’s very good, honey, but do you think you could write something else about Dad?” I suggested. “He does other stuff too, add some more nice things.”<br /><br /> “Ok, how about … ‘And he takes care of us, because my mom works all the time.’”<br /><br /> Ugh, not exactly what I was going for. I tried not to show any hurt feelings on my face. “Honey, I don’t work all the time, do I?”<br /><br /> He thought hard and then responded, “Oh, I know, I know! How about this — ‘He takes care of us because our mom works most of the time.’” His face was beaming with pride at his adaptation of the sentence.<br /><br /> And so that is how it reads in the final draft he turned in to his teacher. I can’t wait to see it up in the hallway at parent-teacher conference night.<br /><br /> I have been thinking a lot lately about the parenting role-reversal that exists when the woman is the full-time bread-winner and the man is the stay-at-home-parent.The following are a few examples from our lives.<br /><br /><br /> One of my favorites is from about 10 years ago, when our oldest was in preschool. It was a weekend and we were both home. The phone rang and my husband answered. (yes, back then we used an actual landline). It was the preschool teacher calling to tell us about a change in schedule. A few moments later he handed the phone to me with a frustrated look on his face. “She insists to talk to ‘my wife.’”<br /><br /> I took the phone and listened as she went into detail about the schedule change. After the call I relayed the information back to my husband, who was the one who really needed to know it, as he brought our child to and from the preschool.<br /><br /> “Strange, she absolutely insisted to talk to you,” my husband said.<br /><br /> We then burst out laughing as we realized it was because the teacher held to the stereotype that the father wouldn’t be involved in school schedules, and couldn’t possibly be trusted with the new information. With us, she had definitely gotten it backwards. Although we laughed about it, I could tell my husband was irked.<br /><br /> That was approximately 2007. Around 2009, during the time of the financial crisis, I started to notice that my husband was no longer the only stay-at-home dad in our children’s schools. An interesting thing happened — with the economic slow-down, many couples with children were making the choice for the woman to keep her job while the man stayed at home. It was a welcome change to no longer be the only ones we knew in this situation.<br /><br /> As our three children have advanced in school, and society seems to have adapted a bit more over the past 10 years, a situation like above with the teacher hasn’t repeated itself. Now he gets all the texts from teachers and coaches, and I rely on him 100% to keep track of our kids’ schedules. To be honest, at times I am downright envious to be the parent least in touch with the classrooms.<br /><br /> I have been subjected countless times to the comment, from both teachers and other parents, “So, you’re the mom!” As in, “so, you really do exist.” They say it with a grin but I don’t understand why, as it is not funny, it is hurtful, and, dare I say, sexist. I don’t think working fathers are subjected to this type of commentary when they come to a parent-teacher conference, even if it is the first time the teacher has ever met them. But for a working mother, others can’t seem to wait to rub the salt in the wounds of guilt.<br /><br /><br /> Similarly, I don’t think it is likely that a mother has ever been told by a teacher on the phone, “I can’t talk to you — let me talk to your husband so I can tell him about the school schedule change.”<br />  <br /><br /> Another example of being stereotyped by other parents: some years ago, in picking my daughter up from kindergarten, the only one day a week I could do this with my schedule, another parent eventually admitted to me that she and the other moms had thought for the whole first quarter that I was the nanny, since they hadn’t seen me at any other activities. Outwardly I laughed along, but inside my heart was bleeding. Ouch.<br /><br /> My husband and I never sat down and planned that he would become a stay-at-home-dad, it just evolved as our family grew. We realized life was a teeny bit less chaotic, and we could keep up with all the homework and extracurricular activities better, with one parent at home full-time. I am very grateful that I have a job and career that can support my family on a one-parent income. I know many women who work not because it’s a choice, but because their families would not survive without dual income.<br /><br /> Do I sometimes wish the stay-at-home parent was me? Absolutely. Do my children seem to mind that they have their dad instead of their mom as the stay-at-home parent? Absolutely not. As my son concluded in his essay, “My parents are of course just parents.”<br /><br />posted first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Image copyright (outer article): martieda/pixabay/CC0<br />Article last time updated on 24.10.2017.

245	97	2	Guilt and the Physician Mom: Doing Enough; not Perfection	Recently I was enjoying a “mom day” running errands with the kids, you know, the usual essentials -- groceries, school supplies, and espresso coffee drive-through. At this last stop, the barista made small talk and, seeing the kids in the back seat,  joked about school starting soon and how I must be looking forward to that -- “You’ll get your Mom time back!” To which I laughed and relished the rare moment of just being a Mom. Until one of my kids yelled up, “But, Mom, you work all the time!” <br /><br /> The previous week, sitting around the dinner table, this same child decided he wanted to give his take on what everyone did that day. We were enjoying his version of how everyone spent the day – my husband -- “mowed the lawn and did Dad stuff;” his siblings – “played with the dog, played with the iPad;” until it was my turn – he pointed an accusatory finger at me and yelled “Work, work, work!”  Not destined to be one of my cherished family memories.<br /><br />These episodes, and others, make me wonder how my kids are going to view me, and their childhood, when they are grown. In the best moments, I envision them grateful for two progressive parents who defied conventions and stereotypes by Mom working full-time as the bread-winner, and Dad staying at home full-time to make sure they were cared for, supported in school, and kept from actually building that zipline they drew that would take them from the top floor window to the bus stop across the street.<br /> In my worst moments, I envision them remembering me as that caffeine-addicted woman always at work, always in a rush, and too busy to notice that zipline under construction.<br /><br /> I know from discussions with colleagues I am not alone. Whether we have a spouse that stays at-home, a nanny, an au-pair, grandparents that watch the kids, utilize day-care, or some combination of the above, we constantly question our parenting decisions and life choices.  Are we doing the right thing?<br /><br />As Erma Bombeck wrote, “Guilt: the gift that keeps on giving.” <br /><br /> I don’t necessarily have any answers, but I do have another moment to share that helped make up for the others, and gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, my kids will one day view me more along the lines of option #1 above.<br /><br /> The same child who made the comments above has decided he, too, will grow up to be a doctor. “But, Mom,” he said, “I might feel kind of lonely.” I braced myself for what he was going to say next -- and to get hit with the next load of guilt.<br /><br /> He went on to say, “Because I might be the only boy – you know, since doctors are mostly all girls.”<br /><br /> So to my fellow physician-moms-in-guilt, I write: maybe we aren't perfect, but maybe, just maybe, we are doing enough right after all.<br /><br />posted first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />J.

246	97	2	The Invisible Burden of the Oncologist	The tension that years ago took up permanent residence in my shoulders had faded away without my noticing, so that when I awoke to its sudden return, I realized that for one wonderful week I had almost become used to its absence. Almost...<br /><br />  <br /><br />Why do I do this again? I asked myself.<br /><br /> As I contemplated this question, it was as if the burden of our profession sat quietly next to me on the floor, waiting patiently for me to pick it up.<br /><br />But I didn’t mean to actually put you down, I told it.<br /><br />I know, it seemed to reply in its silence.<br /><br />But really, I didn’t want to put you all the way down. You’re too hard to pick up again. I just meant to put you down a little bit.<br /><br /> No reply.<br /><br />What if I just don’t pick you up again?<br /><br /> Reproachful silence.<br /><br />Fine. Stay there while I go take a shower and think about whether I’m coming back to get you.<br /><br /> My thoughts wandered back in time to a backpacking trip in AK some two decades ago. I had gone with several friends who were somewhat more physically conditioned than me. We were doing an overnight backcountry camping trip. As I shouldered the pack, with sleeping bag and supplies, and fell in line behind my friends, it didn’t take long before I worried about how I was going to keep up with them while carrying my load. My ego prevented me from asking them to slow the pace, so I looked down at the trail and concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other.<br /><br /> When they finally stopped for a break, I gratefully set my pack down. But realized when we started up again, it felt twice as heavy having set it down for the brief rest. What did I get myself into? I wondered, as I staggered along at the rear of the group.<br /><br /> But later that night, when we finally made camp, in wilderness undisturbed by roads, accessible only to those who were willing to make the trek, in the land of the midnight sun, I looked around in awe and appreciation. The burden had been worth carrying.<br /><br /> I finished dressing for work and brought my mind back to focus on the present. I thought about the patients on my schedule. I glanced down at the burden of our profession, still patiently waiting.<br /><br />Well, come on then, I told it, what are you waiting for?  <br /><br /> published first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Image copyright (outer article): Skitterphoto/pixabay/CC0<br />Article last time updated on 26.09.2017.

247	97	2	Finding grace: an oncology patient's impact on her doctor.	At our first visit together, she grilled me without mercy. Her questions were insightful, and her demeanor was tough; I liked her immediately. I must have passed her test because she returned to see me again.<br /><br /> One hour was never enough time in the clinic. Her questions always had a twist I never thought of. I enjoyed our high-level conversations. She challenged me, but in a way that somehow never was unpleasant or difficult.<br /><br /> Yet each conversation would end in the same way; her fear would become more and more visible as she realized there was no question she could ask me that would change the answer I had to give to her ultimate question: there was yet no known cure. She would then change the subject, put on a bright air, give me a hug, and tell me she was ready to head back to the infusion room.<br /><br /> When she admitted to refractory nausea for over 1 month, with no correlation to her chemotherapy, my heart sank. I knew we had to repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain immediately. I prayed for my clinical gut instinct to be wrong, but when my radiology colleague called me with the news, I was not surprised. Just as the answers to her questions were always the same no matter how she phrased them, the cancer was acting out its biology in her body relentlessly, no matter how much I wanted to stop it.<br /><br /> Of all the things I thought she might say, she caught me off guard by expressing that she was sorry I was in the position to have to tell her the bad news. Several members of our team were in tears, but she was not. We went through the options. She decided she would try whole-brain radiation therapy.<br /><br /> The next day the flowers arrived. I was at once awed and humbled by this gesture of grace.<br /><br /> There is no surprise ending to this story. Her performance status declined rapidly. It became all too clear there would be no more chances for chemotherapy. When I went to see her in the hospital, she was curled in the fetal position. I crouched down so I could be on eye level with her, and she grasped my hands. She smiled at me and told me she loved me. Once again, she caught me off my guard. I could not speak; I didn’t want to break down in front of her and her husband. I tried to smile back.<br /><br /> Once she was home, an unprecedented invitation was received in the clinic. She wanted to have a gathering to say goodbye. We were all invited. She wanted it to be a celebration.<br /><br /> I personally find the moment of goodbye with a patient, whether it be in the clinic or hospital, to be one of internal struggle. Perhaps there was a day in fellowship that I missed when this was taught. Whether the patient and their loved ones are ready for hospice and welcoming of the transition, or whether they are resistant and we reach the decision together only after many conversations, there comes the moment when the decision is made, the conversation is over, and it is time to leave the room. Often I feel awkward, as I am uncertain whether my patient realizes this is the last time we will see each other. I try to convey warmth and sincerity as well as some sort of human contact before leaving the room, whether a handshake, a hug, or a hand on the shoulder. There are other times when I can see that my patient does indeed realize we are saying our final goodbyes.<br /><br /> Recently, a very frail man insisted on standing from his wheelchair to shake my hand, look me in the eye, give me a hug, and express his thanks, despite having failed all chemotherapy we had tried for palliation. I found myself lacking any words I thought could possibly match the solemnity of the moment. I mumbled something about how it was always my privilege to be his doctor. When his wife leaned over to hug him, I took the moment to leave the room. I typically have thought that as important a role as we think we may have as someone’s oncologist, once we step away, we fade quickly from the picture.<br /><br /> But the invitation from Nell, as with all my interactions with her, challenged my way of thinking yet again. I will admit that I was afraid to go. I was afraid to step past the barrier of the end of treatment and enter the home realm—the barrier our systems have created that separates us from the home palliative care and hospice team. When I looked at the calendar, I felt both guilt and relief when I saw that I would be out of town on a prearranged family trip. I asked one of our nurses, who was in close touch with her husband, to let them know. I wrote a letter and asked the nurse to give it to her.<br /><br /> Not long after the gathering, her husband was in touch with the clinic. She was declining rapidly, he e-mailed. He was appreciative of the hospice team. He wrote about all the many places they had visited over the past several years, exotic places around the world, how grateful he was for all that they had been able to do.<br /><br /> She died late at night. We found out from the hospice nurse the next day. The following day, her husband e-mailed another message. He described her taking a final sigh of relief. He described his relief that her pain was gone and that she was no longer suffering.<br /><br /> My nurse told me that she was not fully cognizant on the day of the goodbye celebration. I do not know if she read the letter, or if her husband read it to her or he chose not to. A part of me worried that he might have been offended by the letter (should doctors directly write to patients about impending death?) and perhaps decided not to read it to her at all.<br /><br />I wonder how many of my colleagues struggle with this—saying goodbye to a patient. Maybe some have figured out a way to express both the professional and spiritual aspects that no doubt we would all like to do in such moments. I do know that writing the letter helped provide some closure for me, which is typically missing. We are always moving on quickly to the next room, the next patient.<br /><br /> A palliative care physician colleague of mine, Dr. Erik Fromme, and I shared some e-mail correspondence recently about the remarkable people who, despite terrible illnesses and prognoses, exhibit a state of mind that manages to make those around them feel better. A person like Nell, who worries about her doctor’s feelings over her own, even when faced with catastrophic illness.<br /><br /> I have kept the card from the flowers on a shelf in my office. The hardest thing about those flowers was the feeling that I so little deserved them. I puzzled for a long time over what she felt when she sent them. She must have felt anger, fear, sadness—all normal reactions accompanying a devastating complication of cancer.<br /><br /> I eventually realized the flowers were a symbol. I think that she wanted to let me know that the news about the brain metastases had not taken away her inner grace, had not changed who she was. Although grace is a word that can have religious connotations, it also can mean a state of decency, honor, beauty, forgiveness. A gift of unmerited favor; the flowers were a gift of grace. A gift that I realize now I did not have to earn but could accept simply as she intended it.<br /><br /> In oncology, we encounter myriads of moments of grace in our practices every day, and they don’t leave us unchanged. I struggled with an ending to this narrative until I came across this passage by author Anne Lamott:<br /><br /> “I do not at all understand the mystery of grace—only that it meets us where we are but does not leave us where it found us.”1 <br /><br />  <br /><br />Reference<br /><br /> 1.

248	97	2	On bearing witness: an oncologist's role at end of life.	In order for me to examine him, she first stood in front of him, and then hoisted him up matter-of-factly under the shoulders. She smoothly turned to help him pivot onto the exam table.  The ease with which they accomplished this showed the number of times they had done it before.<br /><br /> When the exam was over she hefted him again, and he transitioned back into the wheelchair. Their eyes held laughter as they gazed into each other’s eyes. “Good thing you’ve always been so sturdy,” he said to her, and they both laughed. “Good thing I’ve never been skinny!” she joked back to him. I stood to the side, witnessing a love that surpassed the physical.<br /><br /> I have never forgotten the grace of this man who, in leaning completely on the woman he loved, and who loved him, seemed not weaker, but somehow stronger. And his wife, who put her own grief aside, in order to deal with the physical changes and challenges that the cancer had wrought, in ways that would not make him feel pitied.  Because she knew that was the one thing he could never bear.<br /><br /> Whatever private moments of bitterness they each may have had, they never showed it in the clinic.  Every visit I bore witness to a deep quiet strength.<br /><br /> There came a time where I saw that in the face of his illness, he knew that his time was near. I felt again my role was only to bear witness - he had already made his decision.<br />  <br /><br /> He asked her to be accepting of his death. I could see how she hated it with all her being, but she trusted him, because she knew how much he trusted her. She knew that he was trusting her to let him go in the way he was asking, while he still had his grace.<br /><br /> Another time, another patient, another moment<br />  <br /><br /> An older woman I was meeting for the first time. I took the history - she was pleasant and not at all anxious, and answered all my questions. It came time for the exam and I asked her if she could move onto the exam table. Her daughter, middle-aged, stood in front of her to help her up. They stood toe-to-toe, with their arms around each other. Then they shuffled around in a narrow circle, feet moving together in tiny sideways steps, a dance of sorts.<br /><br /> The moment seemed to stretch for many minutes yet to take no time at all. I might have held my breath so little did I feel I belonged in their moment. During their shuffle-dance, I saw them looking into each other’s eyes the entire time. “Isn’t this funny?” their eyes said to each other. “I am the mother and you are the daughter, yet now I need your help - isn’t it funny how things have changed?” In their eyes in that brief exchange I saw a window that was open between them, and I saw laughter, and love, and acceptance, and memories, and understanding that this is what happens in life, that things change, that children grow up, that the child becomes the parent, that we do not control our fates, but we can still live, and love, and take it one moment at a time, because this is what it means to be human.<br /><br />This post appeared first on The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Image copyright (outer article): Engin_Akyurt/pixabay/CC0<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />J.

249	97	2	In cancer, there is no place for blame.	I recently read a post by oncologist Dr. Stephanie Graff on the experience of blame, from self and others, that people with cancer are subjected to.<br /><br /> Her post, The only perfect cancer statistic is an imperfect one, is a great resource for any of our patients who have experienced or are struggling with this.<br /><br /> Another type of blame we can see in oncology practice is when our patients' families worry that they somehow did not do enough to save their loved one.  They blame themselves for not going to more or different doctors or a different hospital or cancer center.  They second-guess a decision to accept hospice care.<br /><br /> With the inundation of media advertisements and news stories on new cancer treatments, there is a misconception that there is a treatment success for every cancer and situation.  I hope one day that is the reality, but it is not yet.<br /><br /> Some time ago I wrote a metaphorical letter about cancer and hospice to someone, in the hope to find a way to reassure him that he, his family, and his loved one's doctors, had truly done everything possible.  He told me it was helpful to him and so I thought I would use it as part of this post, in case it can be also helpful to others.  Here it is below (slightly altered from the original letter to protect privacy):<br /><br /> Dear Friend,<br /><br /> We raise our swords and drive the dragon back for as long as we can, but too often, even from the onset of the battle, we know we will not win, and ultimately it is the dragon which will be victorious.<br /><br /> Most of the time, we do not know when or why the dragon attacks, or how it chooses its victim.  We have limited weapons to battle the dragon.  Sometimes, our weapons succeed at first to drive the dragon back, and the dragon may even retreat fully from view.  But with no warning, it can return.  And when it does, to our dismay, it has evolved, so that the initial weapons that seemed successful now fall useless to the wayside.   <br /><br /> We grab in desperation for another weapon.  A cadre of our knights toil steadily to invent and make new weapons.  We learn that different dragons have different vulnerabilities.  We stock our arsenals.  There are some dragons who are easily weakened, and we can drive them back with each new weapon.  But with one eye we watch the ever shrinking arsenal, as we are aware with each weapon used, we get closer to the day when the arsenal will be depleted.  The dragon is ruthless, and cares not who its victims are.<br /><br /> It is at this point where the knight must drop his or her sword.  If the dragon cannot be stopped, what can be done to shore up the village?<br /><br /> It means that we know from our experience that this kind of dragon is too powerful.  We have learned from our past battles, and those of our mentors before us, that no human power can turn it back.  Hospice is the shield we place over the village.<br /><br /> So why go to battle at all, one might ask?  Perhaps because sometimes, we find something unexpected, a chink in the dragon’s scales; a weapon that did not work before suddenly weakens the next dragon.  It gives us hope.  We study the dragons.  We learn that some dragons have features that make them especially vulnerable to certain weapons, but not others.  We start saving more villages.  Villages everywhere feel more secure.  But even so, certain types of dragons remain immensely powerful.  Our weapons bounce off their scales like harmless droplets of rain.  There is no rhyme or reason as to why one kind of dragon visits one village, and a different one goes elsewhere.<br /><br /> This cancer was one of those worst-of-all dragons.  I think your loved one, and all of you, were exceptionally brave and you had the best knights fighting on your side.  I want you to know that there was nothing overlooked -- no better knight or secret weapon somewhere else that might have changed things.<br /><br /> We are but mortal.<br /><br /> (as Atul Gawande has written about in Being Mortal)<br /><br />  <br /><br />This post appeared first at The Hopeful Cancer Doc.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />J.

250	97	2	The Prior Authorization Games: Where the Odds are Never in Your Favor	"The nonsensical denials would almost cause one to laugh, if not for the reality that each denial represents potential delay in care for the patient and redundant work for the physician -- work that expands exponentially from the initial time taken to submit a carefully-worded request (in the futile hope that one might receive an approval on the first try). The incredulous laughter at the absurdity of the denials turns quickly to lamentation as my inbox fills each week with more and more denials of prior authorization for reimbursement, which must be appealed.<br /><br /> Case #1.<br /><br /> I requested an MRI of the brain for a patient with a history of malignancy, now with new concerning neurological symptoms. The insurance company approved the MRI, but only WITHOUT gadolinium contrast. I had requested the MRI to be done WITH gadolinium contrast. Some nameless, faceless, person at the insurance company, who has never met my patient, and I am certain does not have a medical degree, dictated what kind of MRI that I could order. It seemed they were willing to concede the patient needed the MRI, but they wouldn’t approve it the way I, the physician, a board-certified medical oncologist, had ordered it. This degree of attempt at micromanagement of my medical care of my patient was jaw-dropping.<br /><br /> The letter indicated I could appeal the decision in writing. I was so upset at the ridiculous nature of the denial that I wrote a more forceful letter than is my typical approach. Here is an excerpt:<br /><br />""… I have ordered an MRI of the brain WITH contrast in order to evaluate the brain and meninges for any evidence of malignant involvement of the CNS. This is according to current standards of practice in oncology. For reasons that are entirely unclear and inexplicable to me, your company has approved only an MRI WITHOUT contrast. Without the use of contrast, the radiologist cannot adequately evaluate the brain and meninges. Please approve the MRI of brain WITH contrast ASAP so that we can properly take care of our patient.""<br /><br /> Less than 24 hours after I faxed the appeal letter, a response letter of approval was on my desk; for MRI -- WITH contrast.<br /><br /> While I was grateful for the patient’s sake that the approval turned around so quickly (not always the case -- sometimes these appeals drag on for weeks), I couldn’t help but reflect on the situation, that what it really comes down to is a deep lack of trust. The insurance company does not trust that I, as a physician board-certified in my specialty, know the best test to order for my patient. Why is that?<br /><br />Taking it one step further, if insurance companies can dictate what kinds of tests that we, as physicians, can order, why do we have a board-certification process to begin with?<br /><br /> I re-certified for both medical oncology and hematology within the past 1 year. It was a good opportunity to review changes in practice and provided the reassurance that I was up-to-date in my fields of specialty, and I have the certificates again to prove it (at least for the next 10 years). It was also a lot of work, expense, and time away from my practice. And for what? What good is being board certified in one’s specialty if someone without a medical degree is deciding what kind of tests will be reimbursed by insurance? If insurance companies trusted the board certification system (for medical specialties, the ABIM -- American Board of Internal Medicine), they wouldn’t second-guess our every radiology order, and make us submit “proof” of why we are ordering them on our patients. Isn't the ""proof"" in our medical degree, and our board certification? The only conclusion that can be drawn is that insurance companies do not trust that being licensed and board-certified in one’s specialty means a physician knows what s/he is doing.<br /><br /> The irony is, I try to put the information I know they will ask for in the original order and the clinic note that accompanies the order. I don’t think anyone with any medical knowledge reads it. The result being that I have to double my work and write a letter with the same information and submit an appeal to finally reach someone, we presume, with some medical knowledge, to “authorize” the test that the board-certified physician has already determined to be indicated. Like every physician I know, I am not given extra time in my clinic day to take care of these administrative tasks, so I am often doing them after clinic hours, on my “own” time.<br /><br /> Case #2<br /><br /> A patient with an upper extremity DVT (deep venous thrombosis) associated with an implanted portacath had completed a course of definitive chemotherapy, and we thus wanted to allow the surgeon to remove the portacath. I recommended a repeat ultrasound to make sure the anticoagulation (blood thinner) treatment had been effective against the blood clot, before the surgeon removed the portacath.<br /><br /> We received a notification of denial of prior authorization. The reason: this insurance company only authorizes repeat ultrasounds for lower extremity DVT for ONLY the following 2 criteria: (1) one week after diagnosis of the DVT, or (2) up to three times in the first 2 weeks if a DVT in the calf is not being treated.<br /><br /> My immediate thoughts on this as a board-certified hematologist were:<br /><br />  These criteria make no clinical sense for any DVT patient<br /><br />  They don’t even apply to my patient as the DVT is not even in his calf.<br /><br /> So again, I wrote the obligatory appeal letter. I explained in great detail where the blood clot was, what a portacath is, and the potential dangers of the surgeon removing the portacath if there was still a large blood clot at the tip of it. Based on the above success, I decided to take again a direct and forceful approach. Here is an excerpt:<br /><br />""…it would be most prudent to repeat the ultrasound BEFORE we remove the portacath, so that we make sure the DVT is resolved (so that we do not risk dislodging a piece of blood clot that could go to the lungs). Your company, however, has decided to deny coverage of a repeat ultrasound. I would ask that you please reconsider this most expeditiously.""<br /><br /> And reconsider it most expeditiously they did. Again, within 24 hours, I had a letter of approval on my desk. It seems that pointing out that their denial of the test could result in a potentially life-threatening consequence worked wonders in getting approval from the insurance company.<br /><br /> But again, I wished I didn’t have to go through this ludicrous process to get a clinically justifiable test approved.<br /><br /> Case #3<br /><br /> A tumor removed at surgery turned out to be a much higher stage than the preoperative testing had indicated. I recommended adjuvant chemotherapy.  (Adjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy given after surgery, to decrease the chance of cancer relapse in the future). However, to make sure we will not be exposing the patient to the risks of intensive chemotherapy inappropriately, I recommend a CT scan to make sure there is not already metastatic disease. (If there is metastatic disease, the chemotherapy cannot change that, and we would instead recommend chemotherapy treatments with less risk of toxicities, to palliate the metastatic disease, but balance side effects with quality of life).<br /><br /> The surgeon had ordered a CT scan prior to the surgery, but the insurance company had denied it. We re-ordered the scan urgently, with the hope to have results quickly, and scheduled the start of chemotherapy in one week.<br /><br /> We received a denial of reimbursement for the CT scan. This particular insurance company told us that they subcontracted this patient’s care to a subsidiary company. We contacted that company. They told us that, no, the parent insurance company is responsible for the decision on authorization. After one week of repeated calls to both companies, we still did not have an answer. We had to delay the start of chemotherapy. After 2 more days, we finally received an authorization.<br /><br /> If I did not have a medical assistant whose primary responsibility is to help obtain these prior authorizations, I would never have been able to take care of the numerous back and forth phone calls that were necessary to finally obtain the approval. No physician could do it alone. (note to self – remember to bring coffee tomorrow for my prior authorization specialist MA).<br /><br /> Is there any hope for the future?<br /><br /> I think so. I think physicians are starting to be heard. A workgroup led by the AMA recently released a statement of Prior Authorization and Utilization Management Reform Principles. I found an excellent summary on this blog post on medaxiom.com.<br /><br />On their website, the AMA states:<br /><br />""The AMA believes that prior authorization is overused and that existing processes are too difficult. … the AMA believes that prior authorization is a challenge that needs to be addressed through a multifaceted approach to reduce burdens on physicians and patients.""<br /><br /> Here are some more blog posts that I found to be good reads:<br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/opinion/adventures-in-prior-authorization.html<br /><br />http://gomerblog.com/2017/02/prior-authorization-eternity/<br /><br />http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/physicians-frustration-prior-authorizations-only-grows<br /><br />http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/content/tags/insurance-companies/prior-authorization-predicament?page=0,0<br /><br />http://www.physicianspractice.com/blog/obtaining-prior-authorization-three-success-strategies<br /><br />http://drmintz.blogspot.com/2012/05/prior-authorizations-suck.html<br /><br /> Epilogue:<br /><br /> Case #1: No CNS metastases<br /><br /> Case #2: Portacath removed successfully<br /><br /> Case #3: Patient able to start chemotherapy<br /><br /> These are just 3 examples of the 50+ patients I see in a week.

251	98	2	Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Cancer: What Are The Odds?	What are the odds of winning the lottery?<br /><br /> Driving along the streets of your town or city, or down the major or minor highways throughout America, you will eventually encounter a billboard encouraging you to buy a lottery ticket to win the fantastic sum of money invariably displayed on the sign. Billboards are not sufficient; radio and television advertising is commonly employed to solicit participation in state or national lotteries.  Once or twice a year the total in the lottery reaches hundreds of millions of dollars, and has even occasionally surpassed one billion dollars.  Amounts this large lead to local and sometimes national news broadcast reports to comment on the feeding frenzy of ticket purchases throughout the nation.<br /><br /> Apparently I am inured to the entreaties from outdoor advertising and other media outlets because I do not buy lottery tickets. I have nothing against lottery tickets; it is not a personal issue.  I am also not opposed to other individuals buying a lottery ticket.  I have occasionally seen a recent lottery winner on the local news holding a check the size of a door displaying a value of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.  I have never seen a single individual who won the lottery frowning, in fact they usually have a huge “I can’t believe this happened” grin on their face.<br /><br /> I don’t buy lottery tickets because I never think to buy one. When I fill my car with gasoline, like many people I pay at the pump so I don’t go into the ever present mini market associated with the gas station.  At grocery stores I am a man on a mission.  I like to make a list for the week, grab a cart on my way through the double sliding doors, and begin my trip up and down the rows of produce, bakery products, drinks, and food items deemed necessary for my family’s weekly dining needs.  Unless I start writing “buy a lottery ticket” on the weekly grocery list, I will not purchase a ticket because it is not on my radar.<br /><br /> What are the odds of winning one of the national big dollar lottery tickets? It is possible to calculate the odds and probabilities of winning hundreds of millions of dollars when intentionally choosing six specific numbers, which are no different from the odds if you allow the computer to pick the six numbers for you.  The odds range from approximately 1 in 100,000,000 to 1 in 280,000,000 to win.  In other words, if every man, woman, and child in the United States bought a lottery ticket twice a week, the odds suggest there should be one winner for each drawing based on our current population.  Obviously, not everybody buys lottery tickets, but some people do make up for those of us who are miscreants by buying more than one set of numbers.  I have a friend who admitted to me last year that he has been buying a lottery ticket every week for the last three years.  He explained, “If you don’t buy one, you won’t win.”  This is clearly a valid and correct statement, but not sufficient to influence me to begin buying tickets.  When I pressed him to explain his sudden interest in high stakes, low probability gambling, he reported a winning ticket would cause him to retire immediately from his job and live out his life playing golf, visiting his children, and traveling the world with his wife.<br /><br /> He is still working every day.<br /><br /> You never know, however. One day it may be his grinning face I see holding a door-sized check for outrageously large amounts of money.<br /><br />What are the odds of getting fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer?<br /><br /> As usual, I am contemplating seemingly tangential topics because I am thinking about a specific patient of mine. Once or twice a year I meet a young patient with a rare form of liver cancer.  This unusual liver malignancy is called fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer.  The fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular cancer is very rare.  There are only about 200 new cases of this type of cancer diagnosed worldwide every year.  If we estimate there are currently approximately 7.5 billion people in the world, this equates to 1 in 3,750,000 chance of being diagnosed with this unusual cancer.<br /><br /> The more common form of hepatocellular cancer is a significant public health problem worldwide. There are roughly one million new cases of hepatocellular cancer diagnosed annually around the world.  Unfortunately, the long-term survival probability in patients diagnosed with the common type of hepatocellular carcinoma is not good.  Less than 5% of patients diagnosed this year with hepatocellular cancer will still be alive five years from now.  The majority of patients with hepatocellular cancer have cirrhosis or some type of liver damage from chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection, alcohol abuse, exposure to substances toxic to the liver, or from genetic syndromes causing metabolic disorders leading to liver damage.  Patients with the common variant of hepatocellular cancer are usually diagnosed in their 50s, 60s, or 70s.<br /><br /> The fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular cancer is odd. Unlike garden variety hepatocellular cancer, almost all patients with this liver malignancy have normal, undamaged livers.  They rarely show any evidence of hepatitis B or C virus infection, and the average age of patients diagnosed with fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer is mid-20s.  I have seen patients as young as 13 years old, and the oldest patient I have personally seen after being diagnosed with this variant was 38 years old.  Patients with fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer often have large tumors recognized after they produce unexplained upper abdominal pain, or when the patient palpates a mass in their upper abdomen.  The majority of patients with the more common, aggressive form of hepatocellular cancer have elevation in a serum tumor marker called alpha fetoprotein, or AFP.  In contrast, fibrolamellar patients rarely have elevated blood levels of AFP.<br /><br /> The treatment offering the best chance for long-term survival in all types of hepatocellular cancer is complete surgical removal. Unfortunately, a very small percentage of patients with the common variety of hepatocellular cancer are candidates for surgical treatment because they have severely damaged liver that do not heal or regenerate normally after a partial liver resection.  Patients with early stage disease may be candidates for a liver transplant, but very few patients qualify for this option.  There is a marked paucity of organs available for transplant, so sadly many patients die while waiting on the list.  Patients with common hepatocellular cancer who have metastases to lymph nodes near the liver have a poor prognosis, and very few survive more than one or two years.  In contrast, regional lymph node metastases from the fibrolamellar type of liver cancer is not a contraindication to aggressive surgical treatment.  There are fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer patients who may survive for many years despite positive nodes, not dissimilar to the situation with other cancers like colon or breast cancer where lymph node metastasis can be treated successfully.<br /><br />The diagnosis<br /><br /> The patient on my mind was in her late 20s when she was diagnosed with fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer. She was living what she described as a happy life with her husband in a small town at a latitude far higher than the sub-tropical climate of southeast Texas, and was an active and energetic young woman.  She developed some difficulty eating and occasional pain after meals and noticed she was feeling less energetic than usual for her.  Not long after, she noticed a firm bulge in her upper abdomen.  She quickly made an appointment with her local physician who palpated a mass almost to the level of her umbilicus (belly button) and recognized this was likely associated with her liver.  Blood tests were obtained and her liver enzymes were elevated, and a subsequent CT scan revealed a tumor involving the entire left lobe of her liver and extending to the gallbladder in the right lobe of her liver.  This tumor was about the size of an extra-large Texas grapefruit.  The scan also revealed numerous enlarged lymph nodes behind the stomach and along the blood vessels leading to her liver.  A needle biopsy of the easily palpable liver mass was obtained revealing fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer.<br /><br /> As usual for patients with this disease, this young lady had no risk factors for liver cancer. Her serum AFP level was normal.  Scans of the lungs and all other areas showed no evidence of metastatic tumors beyond those in the lymph nodes near the liver.  She was referred to one of my medical oncology colleagues.<br /><br /> The patient’s information, CT scans, and biopsy material were reviewed at a multidisciplinary liver cancer conference. The large tumor was occluding some of the blood vessels going to the left lobe of the liver, causing obstruction of bile ducts on the left side of the liver, and was abutting the blood vessels and bile ducts to the right lobe of the liver.  It was decided surgical removal was not possible because of the location of the tumor.  My medical oncology colleague initiated an aggressive regimen of chemotherapy drugs over the next three months.  I met the patient and her family at the beginning of her chemotherapy treatments to introduce myself and to assure her I would follow her closely to consider surgical treatment if she showed reduction in the size of her liver tumor.<br />  <br /><br />“I know this is a big deal, but what other chance do I have?”<br /><br /> When I saw her after her three months of treatment, I was initially stunned. Chemotherapy had caused her to lose all of her hair, including her eyebrows and eyelashes.  She was wan, listless, and had dark circles under her eyes.  Chemotherapy had knocked her down and left her weakened.  Based on her appearance, I was concerned when I pulled up her new CT images I would be in for bad news and progression of her cancer.<br /><br /> My prediction based on her clinical appearance was incorrect. Her liver tumor was dramatically smaller and her tumor-bearing lymph nodes, which had been as large as 3-4 cm in diameter, were reduced to 2 cm in size.  The liver tumor was still impinging on the bile ducts and blood vessels to the left lobe of the liver and was near the right lobe blood vessels and ducts, but I judged we had an opportunity to remove the tumor with a negative margin.<br /><br /> I had a long conversation with the patient, her husband, and parents. When I mentioned surgery was possible, her father launched himself out of the seat and nearly knocked me off of the rolling stool in the examination room with an embrace.  There were cheers and tears in the room, and it took a few moments to restore some semblance of order to have a serious conversation describing the implications and impact of an operation for this young woman.  I explained the operation would require removal of the entire left lobe and a portion of the right lobe of her liver.  I would also remove all of the lymph nodes around the blood vessels going to her stomach and liver and these would be sent to our pathologists to evaluate.  I told them honestly the presence of lymph node metastases in fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer meant she had a lower probability of long-term survival and cure, but unlike other forms of liver cancer, this did not mean we had no chance of long-term success.<br /><br /> I ended the conversation with a ten minute diatribe regarding what I considered to be a mandatory accomplishment for me to perform an operation safely. The patient was already a slightly built young woman, and she had lost weight from nausea and malaise induced by her chemotherapy treatments.  Her nutritional and energy status was poor.  I had one of our nutritionists come into the room with me and we outlined techniques to increase her protein and calorie intake and to push herself with a daily walking program to overcome some of the chemotherapy-induced fatigue and malnutrition.<br /><br /> Three weeks later the patient reappeared the day before her scheduled operation. She was transformed.  She had gained almost seven pounds, she was downright peppy, and her smile was dazzling.  She informed me she had been eating like a proverbial horse and felt like she could be turned out to run with the horses in the field.  We had the perfunctory and required conversation about the expectations of an operation along with the potential risks and complications.  She listened intently to all I had to say, nodded once and said, “I know this is a big deal, but what other chance do I have?”<br /><br /> Playing the odds. The odds of her developing this cancer were unbelievably small, but here we were planning a major operation.  The next day I began what I predicted would be an approximately four hour long operation.  Instead it proved to be a six hour long operation.  The intraoperative ultrasound I performed revealed there was a tongue of tumor extending from the large mass in the left liver into the left portal vein and extending slightly into the right portal vein.  The operation included complete removal of the left lobe and part of the right liver where the gallbladder lies, and a reconstruction of the right portal vein where I extracted the tumor.  Tumor was also near the right bile duct so a portion of this was also removed to assure complete removal of the liver tumor.  The right bile duct was also reconstructed and a tube was placed into the duct.  All of the enlarged lymph nodes were removed and at the end of the operation, a frozen section analysis by our pathologist indicated all detectable tumor had been removed with negative margins.<br /><br />Life after surgery<br /><br /> Young patients often bounce back quickly from an operation and this lady was no exception. She was motivated and up walking the next day.  However, by the third day after her operation, it was clear she had developed jaundice with a yellow color to her eyes and skin.  Her blood tests revealed that her serum bilirubin level had risen.  The value continued to rise for two more days and then leveled off.  Notably, her pathology results came back showing significant killing of the tumor both in the lymph nodes and in the liver by her chemotherapy regimen, but the chemotherapy had also induced significant damage to the normal liver and had caused stasis, or precipitation and blockage, of bile in the microscopic bile ducts within the liver.  We performed scans and other tests and confirmed her bile duct to the right lobe of the liver was open and there was normal blood flow to the liver, but she had high levels of bilirubin in her blood.  She was walking, eating, and feeling well; she just had a yellow tint to her eyes and skin.<br /><br /> After I worried about this abnormal blood test for several more days, she insisted I discharge her because she was “bored.” I couldn’t argue with her as I was performing no active interventions on her and her liver function blood tests, including the bilirubin, had stabilized, albeit at an abnormal level.  I didn’t realize it then, but this was to be her new set point.  When I saw this young lady back in the office a week later, the blood levels of bilirubin had not changed.  She was eating and feeling well and had decided she was not going to take any additional chemotherapy because of the severe toxicities she had endured with the initial treatment.  I was concerned about her abnormal liver blood tests results, so I asked her to get blood work drawn by her physician in her home town every two weeks and send those results to me.<br /><br /> She dutifully complied and results arrived on my fax machine every other Friday. No change in the results, no improvement and no worsening.  I saw her back three months after she was discharged from the hospital and a CT scan revealed her liver had regenerated nicely and there was no evidence of recurrent cancer in the liver, lymph nodes, or other sites.  She felt well, had returned to normal activities, and simply looked like she had too much spray on bronzing agent applied.  We discussed this at length and decided to watch.  A few months later the patient developed a fever.  She traveled south and we saw her in the office.  Her liver blood tests were no different but her white blood cell count was elevated, indicating a possible infection.  A CT scan was obtained which demonstrated a new collection of fluid adjacent to the blood vessels and bile duct at the base of her liver.  I arranged for one of our interventional radiologists to put a tube into this fluid and the result was drainage of an infected collection of bile.  We placed her on appropriate antibiotics and her fever and infection cleared rapidly.  I wondered if placement of this tube might lead to a change in her serum bilirubin levels, but this was not to be.  We also followed closely to check for any recurrence of cancer.  We could find none based on the CT scans.  Our radiologist did a study through the drain and realized there was a small bile duct along the edge of the liver that was open and her main right bile duct was scarred, but open.  We decided to leave the drain in until bile leak from the liver resolved.  Unfortunately, that never happened.<br /><br /> I continued to see this lady every three months for the next several years and slowly increased the intervals to every four and then every six months. During the first five years after her extensive liver operation, her skin and eye color never changed.  She did occasionally develop occlusion of the small drain tube exiting from her abdominal wall, and this problem was always resolved by exchanging the clogged tube for a new one.  She was happy when she reached the five-year survival mark after removal of her fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer because she had been told by her medical oncologists the presence of the lymph node metastasis portended a five-year survival probability of less than forty percent.<br /><br /> I always looked forward to visits by this lady and her family. I quickly learned to walk into the room and immediately announce there were no changes on her scans and no evidence of recurrent cancer.  The entire entourage would collectively breathe a sigh of relief, and we would spend the next fifteen minutes talking about events, family trips, or other important life happenings.  Despite her medical issues and a chronic external biliary drainage tube, this young lady was always involved in helping other people in her community and church, and always asked about me and my family.  She was thoughtful, considerate, and as many of the trainees who worked with me over the years observed, “A really nice person.”<br />  <br /><br />Stroke of fate #2<br /><br /> This routine went on for almost a decade. Unfortunately, we reached a tipping point.  She began to develop problems with anemia, low platelet counts, and intermittent bleeding from her intestinal tract.  CT scans revealed large dilated blood vessels around her entire upper abdomen, a situation called varices.  This indicated the pressure in her liver was high, portal hypertension, and a manifestation of this high venous pressure was dilated blood vessels throughout her abdominal cavity and intestinal system.  Her spleen was enlarged and platelets were being consumed, she was anemic from chronic blood loss from the dilated veins in her stomach and intestines.  As this situation evolved, she began requiring transfusions of blood or platelets.  Slowly, her liver function worsened.  Her serum bilirubin levels, which had been stable for years in the high single digit range rose into the teens and into the low twenties.  Her skin turned from a bronze color to pumpkin and finally a bright yellow hue.  She had survived for over eight years after a diagnosis of advanced fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer, but her liver was failing.  At no point could I detect any evidence of recurrent or metastatic cancer; the combination of the toxic effects from the chemotherapy drugs she received combined with a major liver operation conspired to cause slow but progressive damage to her liver.<br /><br /> She was in her early 40s and otherwise healthy and apparently cancer-free, so I referred her to my colleagues in the liver transplant program. They performed an extensive evaluation and agreed she was an excellent candidate for a transplant.  She went through the exhaustive pre-transplant testing and was placed onto the waiting list.<br /><br /> Eventually the day came when she and her family got the call a suitable donor liver had been found. She came into the hospital and I saw her, her husband, and her family in the surgical holding area.  She was appropriately anxious.  I wished her well, and promised to visit her daily during her hospitalization.<br /><br /> That was the final conversation I had with her. A few hours later my transplant surgery colleagues called me from the operating room.  They had encountered an absolute viper’s nest of massively dilated, high pressure veins in and around the liver.  She was bleeding vigorously from numerous areas and control of the active bleeding was difficult to maintain.  The transplant team finally decided to pack her with sterile gauze pads to hold pressure in an attempt to stabilize her in the intensive care unit.  Unfortunately, over the course of the next several hours her liver, kidney, heart, and lung function deteriorated rapidly.  I had long conversation with the patient’s husband and parents and informed them she had developed multiple organ failure.  This patient had very direct conversations and understanding with her family about end of life issues.  She had told them in no uncertain terms she did not wish to be maintained on medications and machines, and it was clear that was the situation we found ourselves in.  It is an appalling and painful conversation to have with a patient or their family members, but we discussed her wishes.  Everyone agreed she did not want to be on the numerous high dose medications and a ventilator to maintain her blood pressure, heart, and lung function, and she would certainly not want kidney dialysis or other extraordinary means at this point.  The decision was made not to withdraw any care, and to maintain her on high doses of pain medication to assure she was comfortable, but we did not escalate, and over the next few hours she quietly and peacefully slipped away.<br /><br /> I don’t like attending funerals, but I was at hers. Some can be morbid events.  Hers was not.  It was sad, but it was also a celebration of her spirit and the joy she exhibited in her life.  I watched this lady over a dozen years bravely manage and enjoy a busy life despite toxic effects of chemotherapy and a major surgical operation.  She lived with a plastic tube extruding from her abdominal wall.  She was not a victim, she was a victor.  She embraced and loved her family and her life, and was always ready and willing to help others.  She epitomized unselfish, giving behavior by providing care for others heedless of her needs.  She walked the walk.<br /><br /> She was a young patient vexed by an extremely rare cancer which we don’t understand and which she did nothing to cause. The lottery of life odds of her getting this cancer were incomprehensibly low, but she never demonstrated a, “Why me?” attitude.  She had a happy soul who went out of her way to be helpful and kind to other people.  I admire the positive spirit she and other cancer patients and family members exhibit every day as they survive and deal with the emotional and physical effects of the disease and our treatments.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Hermann/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 20.02.2018.

252	98	2	Side Effects Related To Cancer Therapies	Personalized cancer therapy – What’s all the buzz about?<br /><br /> We live in a remarkable time of advances in science and medicine. The human genome has been sequenced and mapped. Materials and drugs on a nanoscale are being designed and developed to treat cancer, infectious diseases, and other human medical conditions. The usually numerous genetic abnormalities present in the cancer from any given patient can now be measured and described, and at times, even acted upon if a specific genetic or cellular pathway abnormality is present matching a drug known to improve killing of cancer cells with that specific mutation or aberration. <br /><br /> Until recently, biopsies of tumors were a process involving surgery or needles placed under ultrasound or some other type of radiologic guidance; we are now entering an era of “liquid biopsies”. Cancer cells shed from solid tumors at a variety of locations in the body can be detected in the blood, collected, and studied. Snippets of DNA circulating in the blood released from cancer cells can also be measured, and may serve as easier and more rapid ways to make a diagnosis of a specific type of cancer, to determine appropriate treatments, and to follow patients who have completed treatment to monitor for recurrence of malignant disease.<br /><br /> Personalized (also called precision) cancer therapy is currently a popular buzz phrase in the oncology community. Unfortunately, personalized therapy has not been adequately characterized or defined.  Most patients want this phrase to imply they will receive a truly unique treatment for their particular malignant disease. This represents disreality and sometimes, disinformation. The average cancer, despite the organ of origin, contains dozens of mutations, deletions, or alterations in the genes. This does not account for the many other variations occurring in epigenetics, which are changes caused by modifications in expression or activity in other genes rather than abnormalities in the genes themselves. Cancer represents a cascade of genetic and molecular events that conspire to produce an autonomous collection of cells, out of control and able to reproduce and spread to other areas.<br /><br /> If you take one hundred patients with a given specific cancer diagnosis, say stage III colon adenocarcinoma, meaning a malignant tumor in the colon spread to lymph nodes near the tumor, the majority will get identical treatment involving surgical removal of the affected section of colon including the regional lymph nodes, followed by six months of standard adjuvant chemotherapy. Certainly, major advances have been made in understanding whether or not a colon cancer has a finding called microsatellite instability or not, and it is possible to perform other basic studies which may be useful in predicting response to chemotherapy drugs or prognosis. Some patients may have a “targeted” agent added to the chemotherapy agents based on the presence or absence of a few specific genetic findings. These targeted agents are stunningly expensive and are not without risks or side effects. Nonetheless, here we are almost twenty years into the new millennium and most patients are not candidates for novel or targeted approaches to treat their cancer.<br /><br />Grade III and IV toxicities<br /><br /> I do not bemoan the state of modern multidisciplinary cancer therapy. I am exhilarated by the potential over the next several decades to move finally toward more individualized treatment options. We are simply not there yet. For the time being we still perform a logical series of investigative steps for new drugs leading to the holy grail of the academic investigator; the randomized controlled clinical trial. This produces so called level I evidence indicating a new drug or combination of drugs improves the survival probability of patients by some usually small, single digit percentage. Home runs, represented by a major (20% or more) improvement in long-term survival probability of patients receiving a novel therapeutic approach are rare. A multitude of cancer drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration when clinical trials of hundreds or thousands of patients demonstrated an only 2-5% increase in survival probability. Usually at a cost of short- and long-term side effects, and occasionally even a few patient deaths caused by the treatment itself.<br /><br /> I am disturbed when I attend oncology meetings and hear physicians speaking dispassionately about the grade III or IV toxicity rates associated with a particular study drug. Grade III and IV toxicities are troubling, potentially dangerous, and more severe side effects with significant impact on patients’ daily quality of life. I was at a multidisciplinary oncology meeting recently where three consecutive speakers spoke about novel cytotoxic or immunotherapies which produced grade III or IV toxicities in “only” about 20% of patients treated. They were seemingly pleased with what they considered to be a low rate of severe problems, and quickly moved to point out the drugs increased survival time by almost six months. I wonder how the one out of every five patients who suffered those temporary or permanent life-altering side effects felt about the “low toxicity rate”?  We are all intent on ridding the patient of their malignant disease and pulling out all the stops to extend survival, but I fear we not infrequently forget the impact of our therapies.<br /><br />Return of a former patient<br /><br /> I saw a patient in clinic last month who is an interesting and strange combination of a cancer treatment success story but also a cautionary tale. I recognized the name when I saw it on my clinic list, but couldn’t immediately place a face or a story to him. He was coming to see me as a new patient. He was referred to me with a diagnosis simply stated as “liver cancer”. I walked into the examination room, and a slightly built, thin gentleman in his late 60s rose slowly from the chair. He smiled and greeted me, asking, “Do you remember me, Doc?” He certainly looked familiar and as I swept the dusty corridors of my memory files, I suddenly realized I did know this man. However, he had aged markedly since I had last seen him. I grasped his shoulder with my left hand and enthusiastically pumped his right hand. I asked him to take a seat and I opened with a very general question, “What is going on?”<br /><br /> He spoke for the next ten minutes and laid out the amazing and harrowing medical journey he had traveled since I last saw him. My history with this gentleman began over twenty-five years ago when he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the right side of his colon. I removed the tumor-bearing section of colon and because it had spread to two of the lymph nodes near the primary cancer, he received six months of the standard adjuvant chemotherapy at the time; two drugs called 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Leucovorin. This man worked in machine shops and around oil drilling rigs throughout Texas and offshore in the Gulf Coast so he was outdoors in the sun frequently. He developed significant blistering of his exposed skin from enhanced sun sensitivity related to the 5-FU treatments. Nonetheless, he endured the treatments and returned to his normal life and duties.<br /><br /> I lost track of him after the colon operation until 2001. He didn’t want to take time off from work to travel to the big city. He had gone almost nine years without any evidence of cancer until his medical oncologist noted a slight rise in a serum tumor blood test; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). A perfunctory CT scan revealed a solitary metastasis at the edge of the right lobe of the liver. He was referred to return back to see me for surgical treatment. After we completed a thorough diagnostic evaluation, I performed a segmental resection to remove the single tumor which required removing less than 10% of his normal liver volume. At the time I noted his liver was quite normal in appearance. This gentleman was a smoker, admitting he smoked at least two packs of cigarettes a day while on the job, but he was not a heavy drinker. As he put it to me, he enjoyed an occasional glass of wine when he took his wife out for dinner or a beer at a ball game. He certainly had no evidence of any liver damage or abnormalities other than the single liver metastasis.<br /><br />“I’m still around, Doc!”<br /><br /> This gentleman returned to his hometown in central West Texas and received an additional six months of chemotherapy with his local medical oncologist. This included a drug relatively new at the time. We have subsequently learned this drug can produce damage to the liver by inducing a condition called steatohepatitis, literally fatty inflammation of the liver. Any drug or agent causing damage and inflammation to the liver can produce cirrhosis of the liver. Excess alcohol intake inflames the liver leading to cirrhosis, certain chemicals can cause liver damage, and worldwide chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus causes liver inflammation, damage, cirrhosis, and an increased risk to develop primary hepatocellular cancer.<br /><br /> I am foreshadowing here. This gentleman had never returned to see me after his operation in 2001. He explained when he returned recently he was too busy working rigs offshore and throughout different areas of Texas. I had not seen him in over fifteen years. He had aged dramatically during those years and was diagnosed with three new different cancers. First, in 2004 he developed a cough and a chest X-ray revealed a tumor in his upper right lung. A biopsy confirmed primary lung cancer so he underwent surgical removal of the upper lobe followed by six months of another chemotherapy cocktail. Sadly, despite developing a cigarette-induced cancer, he did not stop smoking. In 2010 his wife, also a smoker, developed an aggressive lung cancer and rapidly succumbed. Before she passed away, she mentioned to him, “Your voice is hoarse and scratchy, what is wrong with you?”<br /><br /> After burying his wife, he went to see his oncologist who referred him to a head and neck surgical specialist. A squamous cancer of the vocal cords was diagnosed. He underwent more chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When I saw him last month he had a voice that sounded like Joe Cocker after smoking several packs of cigarettes. This was his new normal. He reported his mouth was constantly dry from radiation therapy. He had difficulty swallowing and he always had the worst case of “cotton mouth” he could imagine. I recalled he was always a wiry gentleman, but he was now emaciated related to his difficulties with dry mouth and swallowing.<br /><br /> Dutifully, this gentleman went to see his medical oncologist and he performed various screening studies. One of these included measurement of tumor marker for prostate cancer called a prostate specific antigen, or PSA.  In 2014 this blood value was significantly elevated.  Further diagnostics studies and biopsies revealed prostate cancer. The patient underwent more radiation therapy to the prostate gland and the serum PSA value returned to normal. However, as a side effect of the radiation therapy he developed significant radiation proctitis, meaning inflammation of the lining of the rectum, manifest as frequent bleeding with bowel movements and severe pain upon defecation.<br /><br /> As he recounted all of these events and interventions, I sat quietly, occasionally shaking my head in disbelief and incredulity at what he had endured. I tried to put a positive spin on things when I told him, “You are a remarkable guy. Here you are alive and kicking over 25 years after your original cancer diagnosis.”<br /><br /> He rapidly and quietly deflated my congratulatory attempt when he stated, “You guys keep trying to poison me with drugs and radiation, but I’m still around, Doc.”<br /><br />Can chemotherapy drugs cause liver damage?<br /><br /> A clear understanding was reached without further comment from either of us. He is alive, but he paid a high price because of his personal choices and addiction to cigarettes causing lung and vocal cord cancer, and because of the numerous cancer treatments to control and eradicate his malignant tumors while damaging normal tissues and organs. I proceeded to ask about his current situation. He reported he developed right upper abdominal pain just before the new year and his oncologist had obtained a CT scan. Two new tumors were present in his liver, and his oncologist was surprised to discover he had clear evidence of cirrhosis of the liver. The patient’s liver was shrunken in size and had a crenelated appearance consistent with the usual cobblestone scarring of a damaged liver. He also had dilated venous blood vessels, called varices, denoting increased pressure in the portal venous system of the liver. A biopsy of one of the tumors revealed hepatocellular cancer. This gentleman had no evidence of hepatitis of B or C virus infection on additional blood tests, and was not a heavy alcohol drinker. When I pressed him for additional information, he readily admitted he worked around numerous types of toxic chemicals during his long career, but he asked an incisive question, “Could the chemotherapy drugs have caused damage to my liver?”<br /><br /> A reasonable question for which I had no definitive answer, but I did inform him it was possible. The liver is the organ that breaks down or metabolizes all drugs and medications we deliver to patients either as tablets or through intravenous drips. Chemotherapy drugs by definition are toxic compounds and injury and inflammation to the liver is a potential outcome. This man had also spent a career working with industrial solvents and chemicals known to produce liver damage.  The liver damage leading to cirrhosis in my patient was not from the common causes of hepatitis B or C virus infection or alcohol abuse, but was likely multifactorial in nature. Chemotherapy drugs are one of those factors.<br /><br />Microwave thermal ablation<br /><br /> The malignant tumors in this man were in the right lobe of his liver. Based on location within the right lobe, I knew it would require removal of over 65% of his liver. I was aware such a significant resection of volume in this man with relatively advanced cirrhosis would produce lethal liver failure. Fortunately, a complete workup to detect any evidence of metastasis of the liver cancer to other areas in the body was negative. Therefore, I performed a less invasive operation using two small incisions each 1cm in size. Through one incision just above the belly button I placed an operating laparoscope which provides magnified images of all of the organs in the peritoneal cavity. Through the second incision I placed a laparoscopic ultrasound probe to identify and locate the malignant tumors. I was then able to pierce the skin with a microwave ablation needle and use the ultrasound probe to guide placement of the needle into each tumor. The microwave equipment was activated and at the completion of this treatment, both tumors and a surrounding zone of the liver had been destroyed. He tolerated this operation without any complications or difficulty and was discharged home two days later.<br /><br /> One of his tumors was at the surface of the far right lobe stretching the liver capsule. This was likely the cause of his initial pain and discomfort leading him to seek attention with his local physician. Happily, after the microwave thermal ablation, the pain related to the liver tumor abated within a few days.<br /><br /> I saw this man back in my clinic recently for his first post-operative checkup. When I asked him how he was feeling, he replied with a smile and a wink, “I feel all stretched out.” Prior to the operation I had described the technique of a laparoscopic surgical procedure, which includes distending the abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide gas to permit better visualization of all of the organs and structures. It does stretch the abdominal wall a bit, and most patients have some soreness of their abdominal wall for a few days. This man entered dangerous territory when he looked at the female medical assistant with me in the room and told her, “Now I know what pregnancy feels like.”<br /><br /> The medical assistant has been through two pregnancies and full term deliveries of healthy babies. With what can only be described as a sneer and a look of pure disgust, she retorted, “I don’t think so.” I quickly suggested to my patient he refrain from comparing a brief laparoscopic operation to a nine-month pregnancy or be faced with open derision and possible physical harm. He laughed, the medical assistant shook her head, rolled her eyes, and uttered a single word, “Men!”<br /><br />More effective and less toxic therapies<br /><br /> Over a quarter of a century this man has developed, and so far survived, five different distinct types of cancer. He has now lived over fifteen years after being diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. He developed colon cancer at a relatively young age, and with his panoply of cancers he deserves a thorough genetic evaluation. He is directly responsible for at least two of his cancers, lung and the vocal cord, thanks to decades of smoking cigarettes. All of his cancers may be related to environmental factors and exposure to potentially toxic substances. I cannot exclude chemotherapy as at least a partial cause of his liver injury and resultant cirrhosis. Hepatocellular cancer can be very aggressive and has a high rate of recurrence. This man has survived four previous cancers, only time will tell how he does following treatment of the fifth. Importantly, this patient accepts full responsibility for behaviors causing some of his malignant disease, but he is openly disheartened and adversely impacted by chronic side effects related to his cancer therapies. He has chemotherapy-induced hearing loss requiring high decibel conversations and numbness in his hands and feet that prevent him from doing the woodworking he once loved as a hobby. He has dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, rectal pain, and bleeding because of damage caused by ionizing radiation treatments. He looks much older than his chronologic age, and he walks stooped and slowly like someone worn out by a hard life.<br /><br /> There are many chronic medical disorders that cause pain and disability in patients. Cancer patients are no different; however, at times our treatments incite chronic symptoms that affect our patients negatively. We must all be committed to finding more effective and less toxic therapies for patients diagnosed with cancer, and we must emphasize and support research to prevent the development of malignant disease. It is a noble and always worthwhile mission.<br /><br /> If we are not willing to make some tough decisions personally and publicly and do the right things to promote healthier lifestyles, we will falter in our battles with cancer. The consequences to individuals who develop cancer, and to all of us as a society, are too great and too dire to ignore and deflect any longer.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />leesean/flickr/CC BY-SA <br />Article last time updated on 30.01.2018.

253	98	2	I’ll Play This Hand	Meet the cowboy<br /><br /> He had read the look of consternation in my eyes. Not a difficult task; I am not adept at forcing an emotionless facial facade. I sat down on the rolling stool in the room, and the cowboy sat down between his two sons. “Get ready boys, the Doc has some news for us.”<br /><br /> The cowboy is in his early eighties. He is the real deal. He has worked on ranches throughout Texas, the western United States, and Alberta, Canada for over sixty years. When he stood to greet me, he was wearing a pair of faded blue dungarees, a long sleeve patterned western shirt, lizard cowboy boots, and a sweat-stained black cowboy hat with the front and back brim pulled down low. The hat featured a turquoise-encrusted leather hatband with a large feather protruding jauntily from the right side. The feather is a turkey feather. I asked him about the feather when I first met him eighteen months ago. He explained his nickname since he was a teenager is “Turkey.” The cowboy is six feet four inches tall and weighs about 160 pounds. He has a long neck and protruding Adam’s apple. He earned his nickname as a young man riding in rodeos when other cowboys would tease him telling him he looked like a turkey astride a horse. The cowboy had chuckled and informed me the nickname got him into plenty of fist fights as a young man, but he had finally decided it was more gracious and easier on his knuckles to accept the sobriquet and celebrate it. The finishing piece of the cowboy’s apparel was an engraved leather belt with a large silver and gold buckle denoting one of his many wins in rodeos in years gone by.<br /><br /> When I first met the cowboy a year and half ago, I noticed the buckle he wore that day (the buckle changed at every subsequent visit), and asked him about his rodeo experience. He nonchalantly informed me he had won hundreds of buckles, saddles, hats, and “occasionally a little money” in rodeos throughout the western United States and Canada. He had competed in almost every rodeo event including bulldogging (also known as steer wrestling), calf roping (as both a header and heeler), bull riding, but his specialty was bronco busting. He called it “bronc bustin’.” He had also ridden cutting horses, shot from the saddle at targets, and had worked plenty of arenas as a pick up rider. He had told me briefly about his rodeo days in a calm and non-boasting fashion. When he finished, his two sons, who were present every time he came to see me, proudly informed me their father was one of the best bucking horse riders of his era.<br /><br /> The cowboy’s response was to wink at me and say, “Hell, Doc, it was no big deal.”<br /><br />From chronic hepatitis C virus infection to cirrhosis<br /><br /> The cowboy’s primary care physician referred him to me to treat a primary liver cancer. The doctor from a small town in central Texas had followed the cowboy for a hepatitis C virus infection that was diagnosed over a decade ago when some routine liver blood tests were abnormal. The cowboy has a variety of black ink tattoos on both of his arms and across his back and chest. He had obtained these over a period of many years in various towns and cities across the country. He had never used drugs of any type, but did admit to “a fair amount of hard drinking” in bars and honky-tonks throughout the west. He also admitted to spending a few nights in county lock ups after “brawlin’, bustin’ up some chairs, and breakin’ a few noses” in bar fights. He had suffered numerous injuries working as a cowboy, but never required a blood transfusion. The cowboy probably acquired his chronic hepatitis C virus infection from an unclean needle used during one of his tattoo sessions, but it is impossible to know exactly how long he had carried the asymptomatic infection.<br /><br /> As it frequently does, the chronic hepatitis C virus infection had ultimately produced damage to his liver. A decade ago he was diagnosed with early stage cirrhosis. When the hepatitis C virus was diagnosed, the cowboy went through a year of treatment with interfon, a medication injected several times weekly to eradicate the virus. The treatment is not uniformly effective, and is associated with significant side effects. He suffered through the year of treatment silently and stoically, but confessed to me that one of the happiest days of his life was the day he received his last interfon injection. Fortunately, the drug had done its work and the virus disappeared from his blood. But the damage to his liver was already done, so his local doctor had dutifully been following him with annual visits and blood tests. Cirrhosis is an insidious disease and can worsen over time, and cirrhosis related to chronic hepatics B or C virus infection increases the risk to develop hepatocellular cancer (HCC).<br /><br />“Hell Doc, just cut the damn thing out.”<br /><br /> The local physician measured the cowboy’s serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) yearly. Eighteen months ago the AFP level was elevated for the first time. The doctor ordered a computed tomography (CT) scan which revealed a tumor in the left liver with the classic radiographic appearance of HCC. The family medicine physician consulted with an oncologist in the region who instructed him to refer the cowboy to me.<br /><br /> When I first met the cowboy, he was wearing the same hat. As a sign of respect, he doffed the hat revealing a full head of long, wavy silver hair to match his lamb chop side burns and bushy mustache. This was also the first of several bruising handshakes I received from this lean, strong man. When I met with him and his sons, we reviewed his CT images. He had a 3 cm tumor in the lateral aspect of the left lobe of his liver. The CT scans also revealed an irregular, shrunken, and cobbled contour of his liver consistent with his known cirrhosis. However, his liver function blood tests were normal and he had never had any of the serious clinical sequela associated with cirrhosis, including bleeding from dilated veins in the intestinal tract (varices), encephalopathy (severe mental confusion), or ascites (build up of fluid in the belly cavity). The CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no evidence of metastatic disease from his primary liver cancer, so we discussed surgical removal of the tumor. I discussed other HCC therapeutic options including chemotherapy, injection of mixtures of chemotherapy drugs and particles into the blood vessels going into the liver tumor to block, or “embolize” the blood vessels to starve the tumor of nutrients and oxygen, injection of radioactive particles into the tumor, and even liver transplant. Patients with early stage HCC confined to the liver may be considered for liver transplant if the tumor is not growing into major blood vessels. A liver transplant is a major undertaking, and being over eighty years old the cowboy was not interested in this option, and frankly would probably not have been a candidate. After patiently listening to me list treatment options, he made a quick conversation-ending decision when he stated, “Hell Doc, just cut the damn thing out.”<br /><br /> Clear direction was provided. Two weeks after I met the cowboy, he underwent a straightforward operation to remove a small section of the liver bearing the malignant tumor. In patients with cirrhosis, hepatobiliary surgeons must be cautious about the amount of liver we resect because the risk of post-operative liver failure is much higher. Fortunately, it was possible to remove less than 20% of this man’s liver, and he recovered uneventfully and without complication.<br /><br />Return of the tumor<br /><br /> I followed the cowboy in our clinic every three months after the operation. I had informed him and his sons the pathology results from his HCC revealed growth of malignant cells into microscopic blood vessels around the cancer, indicating a higher risk to have subclinical, undetectable metastasis somewhere in his body. He faithfully returned every three months for follow up blood tests and a CT scan. When I saw him a few weeks ago, I was immediately concerned when I noticed his serum AFP level, which had returned to a normal value after the liver resection, was again elevated. I opened his CT images on the computer and quickly learned why the AFP was abnormal. The cowboy had four or five sub-centimeter tumor nodules in each lung, and a new tumor in both adrenal glands, none of which were present on the CT three months prior.<br /><br /> As he sat between his two sons at our most recent visit, I explained the findings on his CT images. I reported his AFP blood test was again elevated, indicating HCC had metastasized to his lungs and adrenal glands. He inquired about the normal role of the adrenal glands, which I explained in terms he found acceptable. He slowly turned his head and wordlessly nodded to each of his sons, and then turned back to me. Making direct eye contact he stated, “I’ve had a helluva life Doc. I think I’m just gonna play this hand out.“<br /><br /> I understood his meaning. After his liver operation we again discussed chemotherapy and its side effects, and he responded by making a sour face. I informed the cowboy I would be happy to see him at regular intervals if he desired. He was taken aback and asked why I would do that since I would not be operating on him again. I indicated that oncology physicians follow their patients even during end of life periods in order to provide assistance, medication, or other support for symptoms or problems that may arise. He thoughtfully stroked his mustache, stood up, and offered a final handshake. “Thank you, Doc.  I’ll call you if I need you.”<br /><br />Enjoy the rest of your life, cowboy!<br /><br /> I respect the cowboy’s decision. He lived a rough and tumble life in the outdoors and is a happy and content man. I always enjoyed clinic days when I saw he was on my schedule because I was assured twenty minutes or so of tales about life in the saddle in rodeos and on ranches. I will miss those stories. But, I stand ready to assist the cowboy and any other patient I care for regardless of their status, even if all of our treatments have failed to halt the recurrence and progression of their cancer. I also understand and accept those who eschew surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or other treatments producing side effects and risks.<br /><br /> I ushered the cowboy out of the exam room and he walked steadily down the hall and out the clinic exit door. One of his sons followed, and one intentionally lingered. As father and son walked through the door, he turned, smiled, shook my hand, and thanked me for my care. He informed me he would call me when his father’s time on earth had passed, and also assured me he would call if his father had any symptoms or problems requiring my intervention. He turned and walked out the door.<br /><br /> Enjoy your remaining time in the saddle cowboy. None of us knows for certain when we’re going to be bucked off for the last time.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Free-Photos/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 28.11.2017.

254	98	2	The Snap Of A Glove	Humans engage in numerous types of repetitive, rote, and semi-conscious activities every day. Some may teeter close to the edge of the subliminal if the activity has been repeated so often it does not register in your conscious thoughts. I can think of many examples. For instance, when driving your automobile on a multiple lane road or highway, well-trained drivers reflexly flick their left or right turn signal to indicate an intention to change lanes. The exception to this unconscious signal occurs regularly in Texas when drivers of large extended-cab or “Duelie” (two back wheels on each side) pickup trucks switch rapidly across one or more traffic lanes without a turn signal indicating their intent. Apparently, pickup trucks and their drivers are exempt from this common sense and common courtesy maneuver. I apologize, I digress into editorializing. I warrant if any of us were to make a concerted effort to pay attention to every automatic task we perform during a given day, we would be surprised at the number of episodes that don’t register in our stream of consciousness.<br /><br />About awareness and habits<br /><br /> A specific event led me down the trail thinking about repetitive activities. Every time I perform a surgical operation, I wash my hands for several minutes at a scrub sink outside the operating room. After rinsing the soapsuds off my arms, I enter the operating suite and the scrub nurse or tech hands me a sterile towel to dry my hands and arms. They then hold out a sterile surgical gown and I place my arms through the two holes while the circulating nurse ties the back of the gown. The scrub nurse offers a sterile surgical glove for my right hand with the opening stretched wide. I slide my hand into the glove, and with a snap he or she releases the glove to clamp down over my surgical gown. I grasp the edge of the left glove with my gloved right hand, and the second glove is extended up my arm and snapped in place. Because I double glove, I’m guaranteed four snaps of the glove every time I scrub into an operation. For reasons I cannot ascertain, three weeks ago, for the first time in over two decades, the snap of the glove entered into my sentient mind.<br /><br /> A dangerous situation, this led to musings about awareness and habits. After pondering for a few minutes, I realized the snap of a glove in the operating room for me is akin to the starter’s pistol for a runner or swimmer. The snap brings me into total focus on the task at hand, the operation to be performed. I am locked, loaded, and prepared to engage the malignant disease affecting my patient. I had become so accustomed to the snap of the gloves the significance was relegated to a subconscious, yet still important place.<br /><br /> Including my general surgery residency, surgical oncology fellowship, and years as a faculty surgical oncologist, I have performed over 8,000 operations. That is more than 16,000 glove snaps over the course of my career.  Actually, it is a few thousand more because I routinely “break scrub” (move away from the sterile surgical field and remove my sterile gown and gloves) during the case to stroll with the surgical specimen to the frozen section laboratory to look through a microscope at slides of the resected tumor with a pathologist. We check to assure the resection margins are free of tumor to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in the surgical bed. After confirming that complete resection of the malignant tumor has been achieved, I scrub my hands again and return to the operating room to repeat the gowning and the double gloving procedure. The operation must be completed!<br /><br />The origin of surgical gloves<br /><br /> Thoughtfully, I realize the snap of the glove is a reassuring sound I have heard thousands of times. It is a poignant moment indicating the surgical and anesthesia teams are ready, the patient is prepped and ready to be draped with sterile towels, and the planned operation is to begin imminently. The wearing of sterile surgical gowns and gloves, along with caps and masks to cover our hair and face is a tradition based on the recognition over a hundred years ago of the importance of sterile technique, including sterile instruments, used by the surgical team. Surgical gloves have an interesting back story, being first requested by the famous Johns Hopkins surgeon William Stewart Halstead for his scrub nurse, Caroline Hampton. He asked the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to produce thin, flexible, rubber gloves to protect her hands chafed by the carbolic acid and mercuric chloride used to disinfect the skin of patients. It turns out his scrub nurse was also his girlfriend, and eventually his wife, so his act was both thoughtful and chivalrous. Halstead’s laconic description regarding the origin of surgical gloves is a famous piece of modern surgical history:<br /><br /> In the winter of 1889 and 1890—I cannot recall the month—the nurse in charge of my operating-room complained that the solutions of mercuric chloride produced a dermatitis of her arms and hands. As she was an unusually efficient woman, I gave the matter my consideration and one day in New York requested the Goodyear Rubber Company to make as an experiment two pair of thin rubber gloves with gauntlets. On trial these proved to be so satisfactory that additional gloves were ordered. In the autumn, on my return to town, an assistant who passed the instruments and threaded the needles was also provided with rubber gloves to wear at the operations. At first the operator wore them only when exploratory incisions into joints were made. After a time the assistants became so accustomed to working in gloves that they also wore them as operators and would remark that they seemed to be less expert with the bare hands than with the gloved hands.<br /><br /> The sterile gloves have a two-way function; they avoid exposing a patient to potentially pathogenic micro-organisms on the surgeon’s or surgical teams’ hands, but gloves also protect the surgical team from infectious agents sometimes harbored within the patients’ blood or body cavities.<br /><br />Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule<br /><br /> The snap of a glove also made me think about Malcom Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule. When Gladwell first proposed this principle, he suggested that 10,000 hours of “deliberate practice” is required to become world-class in any field. After suddenly and unexpectedly having the snap of a glove move from my unconscious to conscious mind, I began thinking about how many hours I had spent in the practice of surgery. First, it is interesting that in all medical specialties we use the term “practice.” Practice implies ongoing training, education, innovation, experimentation, and elucidation of new medical and scientific understanding is required for continuous improvement in the physician’s craft. I began thinking about my own career and decided to make some gross, conservative, but rational estimates. I have been performing surgical procedures for 35 years. I estimate I am engaged in surgical operations on patients about 30 hours a week. I chose 40 weeks a year performing surgical procedures. I know this is an underestimate, but I did it intentionally to count vacation or time spent away at academic meetings or giving lectures at institutions around the world. I multiplied 30 hours a week for 40 weeks a year for 35 years to reckon 42,000 hours spent in the operating room.<br /><br /> That figure far surpasses Gladwell’s proposed 10,000 hours of focused practice to become an expert in a field of endeavor. This 10,000-hour rule has been debunked in several studies recently.  In my opinion, 10,000 hours of practice are not adequate to become a master in the field of surgery. I never believed this number was valid for those of us drawn to a career as surgeons. We all know, whether consciously or subliminally, operations can have unexpected occurrences to derail our plans for a straightforward and successful procedure. New technologies, new equipment, scientific and engineering advances, minimally invasive and robotic platforms, and new combinations of medications and treatments conspire to keep the surgeon learning new material constantly. I know from personal experience if I relax or think I’ve got a specific operation or technique down pat, inevitably it seems some event occurs, including an equipment malfunction, an unusual variation in anatomy, additional tumor nodules or malignant disease extending into adjacent organs not detected on pre-operative imaging studies, or an unanticipated drug reaction. Unpredictable incidents remind me to be constantly vigilant, aware, and humble.<br /><br />Prepared for variations?!<br /><br /> As an example, I have done hundreds of operations for patients with bile duct cancer, also called cholangiocarcinoma or a Klatskin’s tumor, at the base of the liver. This is a challenging and arduous operation, requiring dissection of critical blood vessels and structures, removal of part of the liver, and reconstruction of the bile duct and intestine. I like this operation. Last year I was thrown a hard-breaking curve ball when a patient with complete situs inversus was referred to me after being diagnosed with this cancer. All of his organs are reversed; the liver is on the left side, the spleen on the right, heart on the right…everything is 180 degrees opposite of “normal” anatomy. So, despite performing hundreds of these operations, I proceeded cautiously and mindfully because everything was a mirror image of what I’m accustomed to seeing. I was exhausted at the conclusion of the successful operation. How do you anticipate or practice for that?<br /><br /> Once a pilot has learned to fly a specific plane, he or she becomes expert understanding the cockpit environment. The controls, indicators, and gauges are always in the same place. We don’t have that luxury in our human patients. Variations in anatomy, different pathologic conditions, effects of medications, body size, tissue strength, and concomitant medical conditions combine to make each operation a little different. But like pilots, as surgeons we frequently train in simulated environments to hone our skills and prepare for unexpected situations.<br /><br /> Despite the length of our surgical careers, we go on practicing, learning, and exploring every day. This is a critical core value for surgeons and other physicians. We must be ever watchful for variations or circumstances confounding a well-planned operation. Lately, I made a conscious decision to celebrate the snap of the glove as the moment to focus and prepare to lead the surgical team to manage every operation with expertise, excellence, and calmness. The snap of a glove has moved from my subconscious to conscious mind. I believe we should respect and honor these well-founded surgical traditions, all created to reduce the risk for patients and staff alike. The snap of the glove is now like the home plate umpire shouting, “Play ball!”. The operation begins, and while we have practiced and rehearsed our techniques and maneuvers over thousands of hours, we must be prepared for hits, errors, and great plays. For me, the surgical game begins with the snap of a glove.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />deborabalves/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 21.11.2017.

255	98	2	Crowded Abdominal Cavity	I completed medical school more than 30 years ago. Medical education, like most aspects of life, has changed drastically in the past several decades with the advent of the Internet and electronic education programs and modules. I come from the pre-cellular telephone and personal computer era when dinosaurs like me carried loads of textbooks and sat dutifully through hours of classroom lectures taking copious notes.  Frighteningly, I even recall college chemistry and physics classes where we were required to use a slide rule for mathematical calculations. Oh, the humanity!<br /><br /> At the time I was a medical student, most medical school curricula required you to spend your first two years in lectures and in laboratories learning anatomy, normal body functions, biochemistry, disease pathophysiology, pharmacology, diagnostic studies, and treatment options. All of us were excited and nervous in the summer of our third year because we were beginning our clinical rotations. The third year was comprised of three months of internal medicine, three months of surgery, and two months each of pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry. The fourth year of medical school had few required rotations and provided an opportunity to take electives specific or helpful in whichever career field a student had chosen. I enjoyed all of my third year rotations, despite realizing by fall of my third year that surgery was the career path making the most sense for me.<br /><br /> In the spring of my third year of medical school, I did a four-week rotation on a busy obstetrics service. It was great fun because the obstetrics faculty and residents allowed us to assist during normal deliveries, and then actually allowed students to deliver a few babies. The experience was certain to cause some tachycardia in the medical students, but after delivering the baby, clamping and cutting the umbilical cord, and handing the child to the mother, a sense of great accomplishment was assured.  It was exhilarating and satisfying.  I was glad I had played lots of sports like baseball, basketball, and football growing up; you need a sure set of hands as those new babies are slippery.<br /><br /> Over three decades later, I had not thought about delivering babies or anything to do with obstetrics. I am a surgical oncologist. The malignant or benign tumors I remove are a source of pain, angst, aggravation, and fear for my patients.  After providing care for thousands of patients over the course of my career it is rare to encounter something that startles me. But I can still be surprised and I enjoy a good practical joke, even when played on me.<br /><br />A giant cavernous hemangioma<br /><br /> Several years ago a young woman not yet 30 years old was referred to me with a very large liver tumor. The patient had seen her local physician and reported she felt bloated and unable to eat a normal size meal. The referring physician examined her and was astonished to palpate a large abdominal mass. When I first walked in to the examination room to meet her and her husband, when she stood I wondered if she was pregnant. She had an obviously protuberant belly and I had not yet seen her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.<br /><br /> We spoke for ten or fifteen minutes and then I performed an abdominal examination. With her lying supine on the examination room table, it was possible to palpate a mass originating in her upper abdomen and extending well below her umbilicus. The mass was not tender but was firm. After completing the evaluation, I walked out and loaded the disk with her MRI scans onto my computer workstation. When I opened the abdominal images, I let out a low whistle. Quickly, every physician, resident, nurse, and student in clinic was clustered around the computer screen. A couple of representative images explaining their interest and excitement are seen in the two images below.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> Almost the entire right lobe and the medial segment of the left lobe of her liver was occupied by an enormous tumor. There were areas of necrosis, or dead tissue, and other regions demonstrating recent hemorrhage, or bleeding into this tumor. The characteristics and MRI appearance were all consistent with a benign type of liver tumor called a giant cavernous hemangioma. The term giant was an understatement in this young lady. Hemangiomas are abnormal, but not malignant, spongy collections of blood vessels which can occur in many solid organs in the body. A familiar type of hemangioma is one arising in the skin (which is a large solid organ), known by the common vernacular name as a port wine stain.<br /><br /> This tumor was massive and clearly causing symptoms, so even though benign, I recommended surgical removal. I knew the operation would be a hepatobiliary surgery tour de force because the right and middle hepatic veins were compressed and the tumor abutted and bowed the main, left, and right portal veins.<br /><br />Carefully dissecting through the liver<br /><br /> Liver surgeons use a variety of specialized pieces of equipment to dissect through the liver and expose blood vessels and bile ducts that can be clipped, tied, or stapled to prevent bleeding or bile leakage. I was forced to make a larger abdominal wall incision than usual in this young woman once I recognized it would be necessary simply to remove the impressive tumor. The resident and I were able to mobilize the right side of the liver and take down its attachments to the tissue behind the liver and to the diaphragm. We used a special dissecting instrument with a rapidly vibrating tip to push aside the soft liver tissue while leaving blood vessels and bile ducts intact. The visualized vessels and ducts were then ligated, clipped, or if tiny, cauterized. We slowly and meticulously dissected through the liver and began the tedious process of dissecting the tumor free from the main and left portal veins, hepatic artery branches, and bile duct. We had to maintain normal blood supply to the remaining left liver and intact bile ducts to drain bile from the liver into the intestine. The numerous blood vessel branches running into the tumor were clipped or tied and divided. Once we had preserved the left sided blood vessels and bile ducts, I was able to staple and divide the blood vessels and the bile duct to the tumor-bearing right liver. We continued the careful dissection through the liver until we identified both the middle and right hepatic veins, and again it was possible to staple and divide these vessels. In a moment reminding me of some of the caesarean sections I had witnessed as a medical student, the resident and I gently wrestled the tumor mass out of the abdominal cavity, but, unlike the gentle swaddling of a newborn infant into a warm blanket, we indecorously plopped it into a very large basin we requested just for this purpose.<br /><br /> Returning our attention to the patient and the remaining portion of the left liver, we confirmed there was no bleeding or bile leak from the cut edge of the liver. Our blood loss for the operation was minimal. We checked the blood flow into and out of the liver using color flow ultrasonography. The liver was re-suspended to the diaphragm and the abdominal wall at the falciform ligament with a couple of sutures, and a drain was placed along the liver edge into the large empty space now present in the upper abdomen once occupied by a relatively gargantuan tumor. The patient recovered rapidly and without problems after her operation. She was young and in excellent health so she was walking the day after surgery and quickly developed a ravenous appetite.  Nothing like having a large tumor compressing your stomach and intestine removed to improve your interest in food again. The patient was discharged from the hospital four days after the operation. Her drain tube was removed prior to discharge, and at her first post-operative visit she was recovering well and doing her best to ingest enough protein to permit liver regeneration. She succeeded well, and now has a large hypertrophied left lateral liver occupying her upper abdomen (see the representative image below).<br /><br /><br /><br />Trading tumor for fetus<br /><br /> On final pathology the patient did have a giant cavernous hemangioma, but the pathologist noted a few areas were worrisome for possible deterioration into a sarcoma-like situation. Her pathology slides were sent to multiple institutions and nobody was convinced she had an actual malignant tumor, but enough concern was raised I decided to follow her routinely for a few years to be certain no new tumors developed in the liver or at other sites. I saw her at six-month intervals with repeat MRI scans which confirmed there was no evidence of recurrent tumor. After about three years, I told her I was comfortable seeing her back on an annual basis. We did an annual visit and scans and blood tests were again completely normal. I had a social chat with the patient and her husband and learned she was involved in several new hobbies and activities. We ended the conversation with a pleasant goodbye and made plans for a visit a year later.<br /><br /> Seven months later I received an email from the patient requesting an urgent follow up appointment. Immediately alarmed and worried, I called my clinic staff to contact her for an appointment a few days later.  When she arrived, I entered the examination room and was met by a somber-faced patient and her husband. She looked well but told me she was there to inform me of a new tumor. I asked if she was having symptoms to suggest the tumor had regrown. She solemnly shook her head no. I inquired if she had a disk with MRI scans for me to see. Another shake of the head no, and then she said, “All I have is this.”  She handed me a black and white ultrasound image.<br /><br /> I’ve been a surgical oncologist for a long time, but thankfully my physical and mental facilities have not slowed yet. I studied the image for a few seconds, and by the time I looked up both my patient and her husband were grinning widely, and then openly laughing. She gleefully exclaimed, “I got you, didn’t I?”<br /><br /> Yes, yes you did. The ultrasound image revealed a normal human fetus of fourteen weeks gestation.  I’ve performed thousands of ultrasounds of the liver, pancreas, and other upper abdominal organs or structures, but even though I’m not an obstetrician, I was quickly able to recognize the image of a human fetus.  After the laughter and general hilarity waned and I congratulated them for playing the scene (and me) perfectly, we had an excited discussion about the elation and tribulations of parenthood.  I shared stories from the time when my own children were small. I was thrilled for this young couple and this was not a conversation I had previously experienced in my practice. We agreed we would push the date of her next MRI scan to slightly longer than the originally planned one-year visit to allow her to complete her pregnancy.<br /><br />It’s a boy!<br /><br /> Some time later I noticed the patient’s name on my clinic schedule. I opened her MRI images and saw her enlarged left liver and no evidence of tumor recurrence. The scan also included the pelvic region and I noted a normal, non-pregnant uterus. I knocked once on the door, entered the room, and was immediately introduced to her new son. I have delivered lots of tumors out of patients’ bodies over the course of my career, but this remarkable, alert, healthy delivery brought a smile of pure happiness to my face. Removing malignant tumors from patients is rewarding, challenging, and often provides the best chance for a patient to be cured of this dread disease. I derive great satisfaction from the blessing of helping cancer patients, but holding this infant was a feeling of deep gratification surpassed only by the times years ago when I was embracing my own children.  I hugged my patient and her husband and quickly reported everything was fine with her blood tests and scans. We spent the next twenty minutes watching her newborn son while talking about the fatigue, sleeplessness, and fulfillment associated with an infant. She was tired, but triumphant. As she left, she waved goodbye and stated, “I could have never had him with that huge tumor inside me.”<br /><br /> It certainly would have been crowded in her abdominal cavity with both a giant liver tumor and a full term infant present. I’m glad the removal of the liver tumor went so well and she is fully living and enjoying life. And more importantly, she has now created new life and will experience all of the joy, pleasure, fatigue, frustration, and induction of gray hair associated with this phenomenon.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />tookapic/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 07.02.2018.

256	98	2	Character: Facing An Unresectable Tumor	I slowly opened the door to a patient room on the surgical floor and quietly walked up to my patient’s bedside one day a couple of months ago. It was late afternoon on the day I had operated on this lady. The patient’s husband and sister sat nearby, heads down and silent. They knew what I was going to say.<br /><br /> I asked an inane question, “How are you feeling?” What answer could I expect? I had just performed a surgical procedure leaving a 6 inch midline wound on her abdominal wall. The patient’s eyes fluttered opened, and she whispered, “I am hurting.” Ask an obvious question; get an obvious answer.<br /><br /> I reminded my patient she had a button to push to self-administer a dose of intravenous narcotic using a pain pump. I pushed the button for her, and a low volume beep emitted to confirm a dose was delivered.  She gave an affirmative nod and admitted she had not been pushing the button.  She then asked the question I knew would come, “How did the operation go?” I spent the next 10 minutes describing the surgical findings and the emotionally painful reality her tumor was unresectable.<br /><br />A retroperitoneal tumor <br /><br /> This patient had been referred to me by a medical oncologist who had seen her and told her she had a surgical, not a medical problem.The patient had first presented to her primary care physician approximately a month earlier complaining of weight loss, pain upon eating, and for a week prior to her visit, nausea and vomiting after every meal. The physician examined her and found nothing abnormal, but ordered a CT scan. The CT scan demonstrated a retroperitoneal tumor involving the posterior (backside) of the second portion of her duodenum and the head of the pancreas. There was no evidence of any additional tumors or metastatic spread of disease.<br /><br /> A gastroenterologist performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy including an endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy. The biopsy returned fibrous and spindle cells consistent with a sarcoma. The patient was referred to a medical oncologist, who just as quickly referred her to me.<br /><br /> During her first clinic visit we reviewed her CT images, which were only two weeks old, and it appeared the tumor was resectable with a pancreoticoduodenectomy because the inferior vena cava, portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, and superior mesenteric artery were well clear of the tumor. I explained the operation at length to the patient and her husband. She was having difficulty eating because of pressure of this tumor applied to the first portion of her small intestine, the duodenum, so an operation was scheduled three days later.<br /><br /> Modern imaging studies are remarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), color flow ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography (PET) have markedly improved our ability to stage cancer patients before an operation and to indicate if a tumor is likely to be resectable. However, these technologies are imperfect and don’t always detect the full extent of disease. Cancer can be like an aging baseball pitcher; it may no longer throw a great fastball or sharp curveball, but it can serve up a knuckleball which breaks and moves unpredictably.<br /><br />Unresectable<br /><br /> The chief resident and I opened the patient’s abdominal cavity with a skin incision and then continued down through the layers of the abdominal wall and opened the translucent peritoneum. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, there was no visual evidence of tumor spread, and initial cursory inspection indicated the small and large intestine and stomach appeared normal. Everything changed when I lifted the omentum, the fatty apron of tissue hanging down from the transverse colon over the small intestine, because I found tumor growing directly through the transverse mesocolon and attaching to a loop of small intestine. The tumor was clearly encasing the middle colic artery and vein, the blood supply to the transverse colon. The resident and I mobilized the right colon and the duodenum to get a better look at the retroperitoneal tumor. Fortunately, it was not growing into the inferior vena cava, but as we explored further we recognized the tumor had spread like an advancing wave on the beach to flow around the portal vein and superior mesenteric artery. The latter blood vessel is a crucial artery, supplying all blood flow to the small intestine and over half of the colon. I performed a detailed ultrasound of the pancreas and the liver, finding no additional sites of tumor except for the monster invading key blood vessels.<br /><br /> Recognizing we would not be able to remove this tumor completely, safely, and with negative margins, I performed additional tumor biopsies for advanced genetic and pathology testing. It was clear this patient would need chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy. Knowing radiation treatments would be an important potential option, we placed a series of small metal clips around the tumor, including those regions not seen on the pre-operative imaging studies. We removed the short segment of intestine where the tumor had invaded directly into it, and then anastomosed, or reconnected, the small intestine to itself.  Finally, we brought a limb of jejunum (first part of the small intestine after the duodenum) up to the stomach and opened part of the stomach wall and the jejunum and sewed them together to create a new route for food to exit from the stomach into the intestine.  We had to assure she was able to eat while receiving other treatments.<br /><br /> After the operation was complete, I went out and had a difficult and detailed conversation with the patient’s husband and sister. Thus, they were already apprised of the situation when I walked into her room later the same day.  I took my time explaining the situation to the patient, knowing she was still drowsy from the general anesthetic and from the intravenous narcotic pain medication. I stopped several times and answered questions, or repeated previous statements if she seemed uncertain about what I was saying to her. She eventually voiced full comprehension of her situation and understood potential treatment options in the future.<br /><br />Faith in humanity restored<br /><br /> As I finished, her eyes brimmed with tears. She grasped my left hand with her right, and then shocked me by saying, “I am so sorry you had to tell me that.”<br /><br /> Unbelievable. This lady was demonstrating thoughtfulness, concern, and compassion for me during a moment of extreme duress for her. Despite me just telling her she has a locally advanced, rare, and aggressive cancer. She told me she was worried about me and how delivering this information would ruin my day. I bent down and gave her a gentle hug and thanked her for genuine care and empathy. I confirmed I was disappointed and sad to be delivering bad news, but my job was to provide treatment and assistance to her and her family. I affirmed I would continue to be available at any time to provide support.<br /><br /> I must admit there are days I feel depressed, distressed, and even disheartened about the state of humanity. This is especially true if I make the mistake of watching news programming describing the latest nefarious, dishonest, or unethical exploits of our polarized politicians, government officials, or malicious, hateful people around the globe.  I’m disgusted by the zealots, the haters, the hurters, the self-serving politicians aligned with special interest groups and lobbies, and the indiscriminate cowardly killers of civilians. Thank God for my patients, particularly ones like this lady, who give me hope and remind me there are decent, good, considerate, and non-egocentric individuals still present in the world.<br /><br /> Blessings come from common people and common events. I remember every day I have much to be thankful for.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ordigital/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 04.10.2017.

257	98	2	The Coach: Battling Cancer On The Field	I have played sports throughout my life. Baseball, football, basketball, tennis, soccer, badminton, table tennis, running, cycling and even a short, and impressively painful, stint as a rugby winger. I would much rather play sports than watch sports. My wife may refute the last comment when she finds I’m watching an American, English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, or Italian Serie A soccer match, or when watching my beloved ESPN top 10 plays from the day before. Overall, however, I am more of a participant than a spectator.<br /><br /> Coaches are important individuals in the life of any athlete. Ideally, they should be good role models teaching the fundamentals and advanced skills necessary to be a successful participant in any given sport, while emphasizing sportsmanship, fair play, and maximizing the athlete’s physical and mental preparation. Coaches are larger than life to many young athletes, and often have a profound impact on their charges, sometimes positive and sometimes negative. I vividly remember all of the coaches who I played for throughout my life, and many of them were loud, profane, almost cartoonish caricatures of a guy wearing a whistle around his neck, commanding and wheedling his players to work harder. I say this because I’ve never had the good fortune of playing for a female coach. I am happy and encouraged to see more women coaching from the youth level to college, and in some sports, at the professional level.<br /><br /> Coaches are people who should mentor, teach, encourage, cajole, and inspire the athletes playing for them. I recall fondly several of the coaches I had over the course of my life, and they are people I still admire, respect, and emulate to this day. Conversely, I also remember the negative experiences of those who were verbally abusive or who denigrated, humiliated, or demeaned the efforts of their players. These are individuals I do not respect, but I did learn from the negative examples they represented, and I always strive to demonstrate the polar opposite of their bad behavior.<br /><br />Meet the coach<br /><br /> I have a patient who epitomizes the positive values of a coach. He is colorful, articulate, bombastic, energetic, excitable, enthusiastic, encouraging, and inspirational. He is an assistant football coach and head track and field coach at a moderate-sized high school in a large city in the Southern United States. He always has a twinkle in his eyes and one corner of his mouth tends to turn upward in a sly grin like he knows he’s about to spring a practical joke on you.<br /><br /> I first met the coach more than a decade ago. I’ll provide a spoiler alert by telling you he is still alive as I write this piece. However, it’s been a long, painful, and dramatic journey in his personal battle with cancer requiring multiple surgical procedures, a variety of chemotherapy cocktails, and radiation therapy. I have personally operated on him five times, and he has undergone two additional operations in his home city for acute problems requiring urgent surgery not allowing him to travel to see me. <br /><br /> The first operation I performed on him was a right hemi-colectomy, meaning I removed the right side of his colon (large intestine) and reattached the small intestine to the transverse colon. This operation was for a colon cancer causing pain and bleeding. It was clear at the time of the operation the cancer had spread to lymph nodes near the tumor and all of these nodes were removed as a standard part of the operation. Once the patient recovered from this operation, he received six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. At a clinic visit with me three months into his adjuvant chemotherapy treatments, he matter-of-factly stated in his slow Southern draw, “I hate these poisons, Doc.” <br /><br /> I understand the sentiment. Nobody is excited about the prospect of receiving cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells present in their body. Temporary or permanent side effects from damage or destruction of normal cells is an inevitable consequence of these treatments. Disregarding the side effects, the coach never missed a beat and continued to prowl the sidelines during football season and the infield during track and field season. His wife told me despite the fatigue and the loss of sensation in his hands and feet during chemotherapy, he remained effervescent and positive as he encouraged his students. <br /><br />“You know you’re messing with my football season, right?”<br /><br /> Things were going great for twenty months after he completed chemotherapy. I was seeing him every four months and checking blood tests and CT scans. The twenty-month mark was not a happy visit because his serum tumor marker test, CEA, was elevated and his CT scan showed two liver metastases in the right liver not present on the scan just four months earlier. I walked into the exam room and he immediately knew something was awry. He let out a protracted sigh, glanced at his wife, and said, ”Go ahead, Doc, lay it on me.”<br /><br /> So I did. I laid out the results calmly, answering questions from the coach and his wife during the conversation. I showed him CT images of the two tumors in his liver and we discussed options. The first option I mentioned was surgical removal of the liver tumors, and as soon as I moved to option two discussing additional chemotherapy he waved his hands and proclaimed, “Stop! Stop! Stop! We aren’t talking more chemotherapy here, Doc. Cut those things out of me.” Fair enough. For completeness sake, I managed to sneak in a few comments regarding chemotherapy, but I appreciated he was not interested in hearing it. I knew we could rejoin the dialogue about more chemotherapy later if needed. Instead, we spent twenty minutes discussing the details of a right liver resection, including the downtime while he recovered, and the fatigue he would experience during rapid regeneration of his liver. He mock glared at me and chirped, “You know you’re messing with my football season, right?”<br /><br /> A week later, I performed a routine right hepatectomy on the coach. The operation went flawlessly. He was up speed walking in the halls the next day, and by day four demanded to be released from the hospital. He was eating a normal diet (normal for the coach since I caught him with a contraband double cheeseburger and French fries sneaked in by his wife) so I had no reason to keep him in the hospital. I saw him in the office two days later. He was healing well and he planned to return home the same day. I admonished him to take it easy for a few weeks and allow himself time to heal.  He shot me a look I interpreted as, “Sure Doc, whatever you say,” and headed out for his drive home.  My suspicions about his compliance with physician’s instructions was confirmed the following week when his wife sent me an email including several pictures of the coach prowling the sideline during the Saturday night football game a few days after I had seen him in the office.<br /><br /> Well then, so much for doctor’s orders.<br /><br />Two new tumors<br /><br /> Despite himself, the coach recovered uneventfully and did well for another year. As the next football season approached, I saw him in clinic for a scheduled visit. To my considerable disappointment, I was forced to walk in and inform him and his wife he had two new tumors in the enlarged (hypertrophied) left lobe of his liver. I have never witnessed a more pure expression of exasperation on another humans face. He kept quickly turning his face from me to his wife and back again until he finally exclaimed, “Well, what are you going to do about it?”<br /><br /> Before I could answer his question he held up his hand like a traffic cop telling an automobile driver to stop and stated emphatically, “Skip the chemotherapy talk, can you take them out?” The two tumors were near the lower edge of the left lobe of the liver, so I responded in the affirmative. It was possible to remove these two tumors with wedge resections.  His response was immediate, “All I need to hear. Let’s do this thing.”<br /><br /> So we did. The next week I performed an operation made slightly more difficult by dense adhesions, or intra-abdominal scar tissue, of his left liver to the abdominal wall and diaphragm, but I successfully removed the two small tumors. An intraoperative ultrasound examination of the liver failed to show any additional tumors. Per his usual post-operative routine, he was up doing laps the night of surgery and was out of the hospital three days after the procedure. I mentioned a few days later at our first post-operative visit he should refrain from full-time coaching duties and, expectedly, he rolled his eyes and stated, “Yeah, right.” I had to try.<br /><br />Starting chemotherapy<br /><br /> Another football season was completed and when I saw him in the winter before track season started, his CT scan revealed a new liver tumor, and also a single right lower lung nodule. This was a relatively rapid recurrence of his malignant disease, so I forced him to sit through a discussion of options, including chemotherapy. To both the coach’s and my surprise, his wife spoke up and remarked calmly, “You know, you really should consider some chemotherapy. This stuff just keeps coming back.”  The look of extreme exasperation returned, but fortunately, this time was directed at his wife. A remarkable staccato conversation took place going something like this (I am paraphrasing because I was laughing too hard to remember it word for word).<br /><br />           “Woman, are you trying to poison me?” <br /><br />The wife, “No, but you are being a stubborn mule!” <br /><br />The coach, “You know I have no time for this chemotherapy crap and feeling down! If I’m a mule, I’ll be doing some kicking!” <br /><br />The wife, “Don’t lay any of your whining on me man. Man up and take it!  And if there’s any kicking, somebody may lose some balls!” (Figuratively or literally? This was not specified).<br /><br />The coach (looking at me), “Doc, are you hearing this? Did you put her up to this?”<br /><br /> I managed to regain my composure and a modicum of professional demeanor, and informed the patient I had not previously conversed or conspired with his wife against him. The surgical fellow and medical student who accompanied me into the patient’s exam room stood by with stunned expressions on their faces. They weren’t sure what to make of this couple or my interaction with them. They did not know them as I did. This couple had been married for over 30 years and had a wonderful bond and harmony. Despite the bad news I had delivered, both the patient and his wife were hopeful. We had a calm and rational discussion of options and the patient agreed to see his medical oncologist at home and initiate systemic chemotherapy.<br /><br /> I called the medical oncologist and explained the situation and we agreed the patient was in excellent shape, active, and would be a candidate for second line chemotherapy used to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The patient initiated treatment the next week. He returned in three months and the liver tumor and lung tumor were both smaller by approximately one third. <br /><br />Fourth round of surgery<br /><br /> When I walked into the room to discuss the findings with him, for the first time in our relationship he looked haggard and beaten down. He shook his head from side to side and told me, “Doc, this stuff is wearing me out.” I get it. His mood brightened when I told him the tumors were smaller and no new tumors had appeared. As usual with this patient, before I could finish discussing all the results, he started asking when I was going to schedule an operation. He had already undergone three cancer operations and I knew he had significant adhesions in his abdominal cavity from previous surgery. Nonetheless, he had two tumors in locations where surgical resection was feasible. I let him recover from the effects of chemotherapy for another month and then performed a somewhat unusual operation. I made an incision at the site of the scar under the ribs on his abdomen, and after entering the peritoneal cavity I began to dissect through the heavy scar tissue.  After about an hour of work his liver was completely exposed. I performed a standard intraoperative liver ultrasound and confirmed I could detect only a solitary tumor at the top of the left lobe. Once again, it was possible to perform a wedge resection to remove this tumor and take only a small amount of normal liver. Then I did something unusual. I had discussed this with my thoracic surgical oncology associates before the operation, and they agreed, while unorthodox, opening the right side of his diaphragm and removing the small tumor at the surface of the right lower lobe of the lung would spare him a chest incision.  Opening the muscle of the right diaphragm readily exposed the lung tumor, which was removed without difficulty. We left a temporary chest tube in to make sure there was no air leak from the lung and to drain any fluid accumulating in the right chest cavity. <br /><br /> The patient was a little slower to recover after this fourth round of surgery. The chemotherapy had weakened him yet he was walking as usual on day one, but at a slow and measured pace.  Nonetheless, he was out of the hospital four days after the operation. At his first clinic visit, I felt compelled to discuss completing another three months of chemotherapy, knowing he would have no interest in complying with the suggestion. The mere mention of chemotherapy earned me a third look of exasperation from the patient, and plenty of eye rolling from his wife who said, “Good luck convincing him to do that.”<br /><br /> So we returned to a follow up routine. Six months later I received a call from a surgeon in his home city who informed me the patient had come in to the hospital with a complete small bowel obstruction. The patient had a fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and an elevated serum white blood cell count, so the surgeon appropriately took him to the operating room and found a short segment of small bowel was twisted, cutting off its blood supply. The surgeon removed this section of nonviable small intestine and anastomosed, or reconnected, the two ends of small bowel. <br /><br />Surgical removal of para-aortic lymph nodes<br /><br /> Fortunately, we had a period of over two years before lurking cancer cells reappeared in lymph nodes along his aorta. I found out about this during a follow up visit when the patient mentioned his medical oncologist had noted his serum CEA level was elevated and had obtained a PET scan. This scan showed three lymph nodes near his aorta were highly active, suggesting they contained malignant cells.  The medical oncologist then treated this area with a combination of low dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In checking the CT scan we obtained, I could see one enlarged lymph node. It was not clear if this still harbored cancer cells because his CEA blood test was normal, so we opted to watch. A few months later his medical oncologist called me and asked if I would consider removing the one lymph node because it was still active on a repeat PET scan and had increased in size. Surgical removal of para-aortic lymph nodes for colorectal cancer is an unusual approach, but this man had already survived many years with stage IV disease, and the solitary lymph node was the only evident site of active cancer. The patient and his wife returned and we discussed a surgical approach. In his usual glib and cavalier style, he instructed me to proceed at flank speed.<br /><br /> A couple of weeks later I performed an operation that was as difficult as I anticipated because of dense scar tissue throughout the belly cavity. Once I moved all of the small intestine out of the way, it was possible to palpate the abnormal lymph node easily. I removed the enlarged, cancer-bearing lymph node and several lymph nodes in the area. It turned out to be a good decision because one of the lymph nodes adjacent to the obviously abnormal lymph node bore a microscopic nest of viable cancer cells. This operation took almost four hours to complete because of the extensive adhesions. As a result, for the first time the coach was in the hospital for a full week recovering from the slow return of normal contractions and activity of his bowel. <br /><br /> I didn’t even bother discussing chemotherapy with the patient during his hospitalization knowing his opposition. His medical oncologist adopted the same approach. The coach and I agreed to a follow up visit three months after his latest operation. <br /><br />Surprise field trip to the cancer center<br /><br /> Two months after his operation, I received an unexpected call from the coach. He called my secretary who paged me and asked me to call my patient, “urgently.”  Anxiously, I called his cell phone fearing I was going to hear his cancer had recurred yet again. When he answered, he said brightly, “Hey Doc! What are you doing and where are you?” This may seem to be a peculiar personal question, but not from this patient. I explained I was just completing inpatient rounds and he said, “Well come on down to the lobby, I want you to meet some people.”  Stammering, I asked dumbly if he was in the building, and he laughed and said, “Duh!” Asking a stupid question, I deserved a “Duh” as a result.<br /><br /> I took the elevator down to the lobby where my grinning patient was surrounded by a flock of about two-dozen high school students. He explained he was teaching a health class at his high school and wanted to impress upon his students the importance of cancer prevention and proper screening for early detection. He decided to load them onto a school bus and take a road trip to a cancer center. No forewarning for me or anybody else, just a spontaneous “Let’s get it done” approach by the coach. He asked if I could spend a few minutes talking to his students. I winked at him and replied, “I can do better than that.” <br /><br /> I spent the next two hours escorting the coach and his students to various areas of the hospital and asking surprised colleagues to explain briefly a bit about what they did in the care and diagnosis of cancer patients. We visited my laboratory and my colleagues showed them some of the interesting research tools we use to study malignant disease. As I escorted the coach and his gaggle of students to the lobby he turned to me beaming and gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The students began laughing and informed me he had a habit of doing that at the school, too. <br /><br />Cancer: A long, tough game<br /><br /> The surgical adventures of the coach were not finished. A little over a year after the surprise high school student visit, he had a new liver tumor appear on CT scan located deep in the remaining lobe of his liver. This time I knew I couldn’t remove it and leave him with a volume of liver adequate to survive. However, radiofrequency ablation to destroy the tumor with heat was feasible. The tumor was near a large blood vessel, the left hepatic vein, draining blood out of the remaining left liver. It was also close enough to the diaphragm my radiology colleagues and I felt it would not be safe to place the needle through the skin using ultrasound or CT guidance. So a surgical approach was indicated. I performed this operation, and after a grueling two hours of dissecting his liver millimeter by millimeter free from scar tissue I was able to locate the two centimeter diameter liver tumor with ultrasonography. I treated it with a radiofrequency needle, destroying it completely. <br /><br /> Four months after this fifth cancer operation, the same surgeon in the patient’s home town called to inform me he had once again performed a long and difficult operation for a bowel obstruction on the coach. Surgical procedures do not come without immediate, acute, or long-term risks. This time the surgeon did not remove any small intestine; the obstruction was caused by a hair pin kink in the bowel where it was stuck to the retroperitoneum.<br /><br /> Cancer is an unpredictable opponent. The coach has been treated with most of the types of therapy we use to manage cancer in our patients. He has never regained normal sensation in his hands or feet as a result of toxicity from some of his chemotherapy treatments. Despite the pain of recovering from numerous operations, the side effects of chemotherapy, and the chronic diarrhea and discomfort he developed after radiation therapy, the coach is cheerful and still leads his teams on the field. His wife has told me in sidebar conversations he is beloved by the students, teachers, and administrators at his school. He is a constant source of inspiration and positive energy. When I saw the coach a few months ago for a routine follow up visit, I was pleased to inform him no evidence of cancer was found based on his imaging studies or blood tests. He nodded, and in a moment of reflection calmly stated, “You know, Doc, this cancer thing has been a long, tough game. The outcome is still uncertain. But one thing is clear. Nobody can say you and I didn’t play our hearts out. We left it all on the field.”<br /><br /> I don’t recall ever hearing a more eloquent or meaningful statement.

258	98	2	Cancer Care In The Future	Multidisciplinary team management of many types of cancer has led to significant improvements in median and overall survival. Unfortunately, there are still other cancers which we have impacted little.  In patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular cancer, we have been able to improve median survival only by a matter of a few months, and at a cost of toxicity associated with the treatments.  From the point of view of a surgical oncologist, I believe there will be rapid advances over the next several decades.<br /><br />Robotic Surgery<br /><br /> There is already one surgery robot system on the market and another will soon be available. The advances in robotics and imaging have allowed for improved 3-dimensional spacial recognition of anatomy, and the range of movement of instruments will continue to improve.  Real-time haptic feedback may soon become possible with enhanced neural network systems.  It is already possible to perform some operations with greater facility, such as very low sphincter-sparing operations for rectal adenocarcinoma in patients who previously would have required a permanent colostomy.  As surgeons’ ability and experience with new robotic equipment becomes greater, the number and types of operation performed will increase and patient recovery time, length of hospital stay, and return to full functional status will improve.  Competition should (and needs to) drive down the exorbitant cost of current equipment.<br /><br />More Cost Effective Screening<br /><br /> The mapping of the human genome was a phenomenal project and achievement. However, we still do not understand the function of all of the genes identified or the complex interactions with other molecules in the nucleus.  We also forget that cancer is a perfect experiment in evolutionary biology.  Once cancer has developed, we begin treatments with cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, targeted agents, immunotherapies, and ionizing radiation.  Many of the treatments are themselves mutagenic, and place selection pressure on cells with beneficial mutations allowing them to evade response or repair damage caused by the treatment, survive, multiply, and metastasize.  In some patients who are seeming success stories, new cancers develop years or decades later, induced by our therapies to treat their initial cancer.  Currently, we place far too little emphasis on screening and prevention of cancer.  Hopefully, in the not too distant future, screening of patients with simple, readily available, and inexpensive blood tests looking at circulating cells and free DNA may allow us to recognize patients at high risk to develop certain malignancies, or to detect cancer at far earlier stages when surgical and other therapies have a higher probability of success.<br /><br />Changing the Mindset<br /><br /> A diagnosis of cancer incites fear and uncertainty in patients and their family members. Many feel they are receiving a certain death sentence.  While we have improved the probability of long-term success with some cancers, there are others where we have simply shifted the survival curve to produce a few more months of survival before the patient succumbs.  We need to adopt strategies that allow us to contain and control malignant disease without necessarily eradicating it.  If a tumor or tumors are in a dormant or senescent state and not causing symptoms or problems, minimally toxic treatments stopping tumor growth and progression allowing the patient to live a normal and productive life would be a success.  Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes are never “cured” of their diabetes, but with proper medical management their disease can be controlled and they can survive and function without any of the negative consequences and sequelae of the disease.  If we can understand genetic signaling and aberrations sufficiently, perhaps we can control cancer for long periods while maintaining a high quality of life for our patients.<br /><br />Taking on Tough Political Issues<br /><br /> I am often asked by patients if I believe there will ever be a “cure” for cancer. I invariably reply it is unlikely if we continue to engage in activities and behaviors which increase the likelihood of developing cancer.  Cigarette smoking, smokeless tobacco use, excess alcohol or food intake, lack of exercise, and pollution of the environment around us produce carcinogens or conditions increasing the risk of cancer development.  Unless we find the courage and strength to limit access or ban substances that are known carcinogens, like cigarettes, and begin as thoughtful citizens of the planet behaving in a more responsible fashion to eliminate air, ground, and water pollution, we will not make a significant impact on the incidence of cancer.  We must also be willing to develop greater and more far reaching population education programs about things as simple as proper ultraviolet light protection during sun exposure, and to recognize tanning beds or excessive, unprotected natural sunlight exposure increases the risk of a particularly difficult and vicious malignancy, melanoma.  Whether we like to admit it or not, humans respond to societal pressures and images displayed or touted by media, marketing firms, or so-called beauty and glamor outlets that may actually be harmful to the health of the populace.  People do and should have a free will, but they should also be given understandable, honest, and rational information on the potential consequences of their choices.  There should also be a higher level of personal accountability and responsibility for negative outcomes based on an individual’s choices.<br /><br />Global Cancer Care<br /><br /> It is estimated that between half and two thirds of the world’s population, particularly in poor or developing countries, have limited or no access to cancer prevention, screening, or care. The improved outcomes we report in medical and surgical journals from advanced countries assume the treatment can be paid for and access is available to all.  Nothing is further from the truth.  Meaningful efforts to rein in the rampant increases in cancer drug costs, reduce the prohibitively long and expensive process to develop and approve a novel treatment, and to provide training and education for practitioners in developing countries must be made.  The disparities even within the United States are great, and it is well known and documented that disadvantage populations are often diagnosed with later stage disease, and generally have reduced chances of long-term success with the treatments available.  We must become inclusive, not exclusive, in our worldview and through outreach and development programs begin to build infrastructure and access to affordable care worldwide.<br /><br />Thinking Outside the Box<br /><br /> Personalized or individualized patient cancer care is a popular buzz phrase these days. In reality, we currently have very few drugs or targeted agents to act upon the numerous genetic or epigenetic abnormalities present in the average cancer.  To search for drugs to new targets or abnormal pathways, we must create a system where there is rapid assessment, cost effectiveness, and streamlined regulatory approval for patients with lethal diseases.  Personalized cancer treatment is not affordable without major changes in policy and practice.  We should recognize malignant tumors have interesting physicochemical and electrical properties different from the normal tissues from which they arise.  Therapy with electromagnetic fields specifically tailored to a given patient’s tumor properties can enhance tumor blood flow and improve delivery of drugs or agents while reducing toxicity and side effects.  Developing approaches that do not produce acute and long-term side effects or an increased risk to develop second malignancies must be a priority.<br /><br /> Science and technology information is being produced at an incomprehensible rate. We need help from specialized colleagues with big data management and recognition of trends and developments which can be quickly disseminated throughout the medical community, and to appropriate patient populations.  All of these measures require commitment and dedication to changing the way we think, reversing priorities based far too much on profitability of treatments rather than availability and affordability of treatment, and we cannot ignore the importance of programs to improve cancer prevention, screening, and early diagnosis.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Foto-Rabe/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 15.08.2017.

259	98	2	That Thing Was Growing Inside Me? (Part 3)	Slightly more than a decade ago, I received a phone call from a panicked primary care physician from a small town in West Texas. The physician rapidly and breathlessly explained a patient came into his office two days before stating he was unable to eat, his waist size had increased from 34 to a 52 inches in only a few months, and the perfunctory CT scan revealed a mass extending all the way from the liver down into the pelvis. <br /><br />An abdomen about to burst<br /><br /> I immediately accepted the patient and told the physician to send him to my office the next day.  This 50 something year old gentleman, who had been previously completely healthy and an active, hard working farmer, was clearly miserable. His abdomen was distended to the point of looking like it was going to burst. The abdominal skin was taut and shiny, and he was breathing over 30 times a minute because he was unable to take a deep breath from the increased pressure upward on his diaphragm and lungs. The muscles of his arms, legs, and face were wasted. He had a typical appearance of cachexia; severe malnutrition with his pleading eyes protruding from sunken sockets.<br /><br /> After speaking with this gentlemen and his family and completing a physical examination, I reviewed the CT images obtained in West Texas. I realized his massive tumor was originating from the edge of the right lower liver, extending down into his pelvis and compressing the stomach, all of the small and large intestine, and even causing compression of the bladder and ureters, the small tubular structures draining urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Despite the relatively immense size of this tumor, it was clear it arose from the lower edge of the liver and was not near any of the major blood vessels flowing into the liver or draining blood out of the liver.<br />  <br /><br /><br /><br />                       Image of a giant peritoneal sarcoma compressing the intestines.<br /><br />  <br /><br />“Bye bye, tumor!”<br /><br /> I scheduled this man for an operation only two days later because of his debilitating symptoms.  I started the operation with a right subcostal incision, a cut in the skin under the ribs on the right side. A quick assessment confirmed the tumor was arising from a small portion of the liver lateral to the gallbladder. Intraoperative ultrasound confirmed there were no major blood vessels involved by the tumor. It was possible to remove a small section of the liver from which the tumor arose, less than 10% of the total liver volume, and then detach the tumor from other abdominal organs. The tumor was so large I had to extend the incision simply to remove it from the abdominal cavity. To my surprise, the tumor had very few attachments to other organs or structures, and once its origin in the liver was divided, I was able to gently deliver the mass out of the peritoneal cavity and clamp and divide the few remaining blood vessels supplying the tumor.<br /><br />“Holy shit, what is that thing?”<br /><br /> This tumor was so large and somewhat gelatinous I was concerned I would drop it or rupture it.  We did not have a basin or container large enough to transport the tumor from the operating room to the pathology suite. Therefore, the circulating nurse brought a wheeled cart into the operating room usually used to transport sterile instruments and supplies from the surgical core area to the operating room. We wrapped the tumor in sterile towels and I pushed it over to the pathology suite. The wide-eyed expressions from the experienced senior pathologist and the surgical pathology staff were hilarious. The pathologist took one glance as I uncovered the tumor and exclaimed, “Holy shit, what is that thing?” Why does everyone keep calling these giant tumors “things”?<br /><br /> I showed the pathologist the origin of the tumor from the edge of the liver and returned to the operating room. The intestine and other structures, which had looked compacted, blue, and pathetic, were already pink and contracting wildly. It reminded me of times when I found myself in a large, relatively immobile crowd of people, and the wonderful feeling of relief once I broke free from the crowd and could move unencumbered. We had plenty of room to spare closing his abdominal wall muscles and the skin.<br /><br /> This gentleman was one of the happiest people I’ve ever seen on the morning of his first post-operative day, despite a long bilateral subcostal incision. He was already wolfing down breakfast of eggs, pancakes, and sausage he had gone to the cafeteria to purchase. We had not yet written an order allowing him to drink even liquids. Absence of a formal medical order permitting him to drink broth and juice or enjoy jell-o in any color he ordered was not going to stop him; he had room for his stomach to distend and his bowel to work and he was not going to wait around for us. He explained he was making up for lost time and was going to eat whatever he wanted. Fortunately, he suffered no ill effects from his rapid self-progression to a regular diet. He was discharged from the hospital four days after the operation. When I saw him back for his first post-operative visit five days later, we discussed the rare hepatic angiosarcoma I had removed. I informed this man and his family I had delivered a 45 cm greatest diameter tumor, almost 18 inches in size. The final weight of the cancer emanating from his liver was 6.5 kilograms, or slightly greater than 14 pounds. The pathologist admitted the total tumor weight was probably greater because when he cut into it a large amount of fluid and old blood drained from the tumor. I estimate after lifting it from the patient’s abdominal cavity to the back table in the operating room it seemed like at least 20 pounds to me.<br /><br />Sarcomas: Numerous operations, recurrent tumors<br /><br /> Sarcomas are unusual and uncommon cancers with a propensity to recur locally or metastasize to the liver and lungs. Individuals who are experts in sarcoma surgery will say sarcoma patients can train new surgeons for many years because of the numerous operations they may require for multiple recurrences. In general, chemotherapy is not particularly effective for types of sarcoma other than GISTs. This gentleman did well for almost four years before he developed recurrent tumors in his peritoneal cavity. I operated and removed these intra-abdominal tumors, and he did well for another two years before he developed a few lung metastases. These pulmonary tumors were removed during two operations over the next year; but the patient ultimately succumbed to multiple new tumors growing in his lungs. Near the end of his life, he declined chemotherapy treatments when he learned the low probability of success in shrinking the tumors and the profoundly toxic side effects. He did achieve over six years of what he proclaimed, “A really great life.” He was upbeat, energetic, ate normally, ran his farm, loved to tell jokes, and travelled extensively with his wife and family. He told me the experience with cancer taught him to enjoy every day he was granted. After the initial huge tumor was removed, he was quickly able to eat and exercise and return to his normal appearance and level of activity.<br /><br />When our senses don’t sense it<br /><br /> Biology is remarkable. The complexity of the human body is difficult to comprehend. There is much we still do not know or fully understand. The development of cancer is an equally complicated process with a mind-boggling interplay of genetics, epigenetics, biochemistry, immunology, and dynamic interactions with the host. The occasional patient we see with massive tumors represents an eye-opening experience for all involved; it is difficult to believe how large a tumor can grow to be in some locations in a human body before causing symptoms leading to detection.<br /><br /> When the inevitable question is asked by patients and family members after I remove a very large tumor, the answer is, “Yes, incredibly enough, that ‘thing’ was really growing inside you.”<br /><br /> And as amazing and wonderful as our primary senses are, I cannot explain why a tumor can grow to a massive size before we sense something is awry.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Keep reading: <br /> That Thing Was Growing Inside Me (Part 1)That Thing Was Growing Inside Me (Part 2)<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Archangel12/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 13.06.2017.

260	98	2	That Thing Was Growing Inside Me? (Part 2)	The liver includes the gallbladder and bile ducts. Occasionally, patients are diagnosed with a massive tumor at some site in their body. Sarcomas arising in the retro-peritoneum, the area behind the gut where the kidneys, aorta, vena cava, and some significant muscles and nerves reside can be larger than a basketball. Patients and family members are astonished a tumor can grow to a relatively huge size before being detected after causing mild discomfort or other subtle symptoms.<br /><br />Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of 20 cm in diameter<br /><br /> A few weeks ago, a new patient came to my office with a giant tumor. She is a patient in her early 70’s who has been healthy and active. She takes a single medication for her mild hypertension, which controls and normalizes her blood pressure. She and her several daughters noticed she was becoming less active and more easily fatigued over the past four or five months. Blood tests obtained during a visit to her family physician one month ago revealed a red blood cell count only about half of normal; she was severely anemic. The patient noted she was not eating well and her abdomen felt “swollen”, so the physician referred her to a gastroenterologist for endoscopy and ordered a CT scan.  The CT scan was obtained before the endoscopy, and a very large tumor of the upper abdomen, greater than 20 cm in diameter, was readily evident. The gastroenterologist performed a colonoscopy, which showed no abnormalities or sources of bleeding, while an upper endoscopy revealed a small area of ulceration along the final third of the stomach. Biopsies were obtained of this area, which ultimately demonstrated a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The patient was then referred to me.<br /><br /> This soft spoken, delightful lady and her daughters agreed to allow several medical students and residents examine and palpate her abdomen. When she lay supine on the examining room table, it appeared she had an approximately full term pregnancy with a mass palpable from the tip of her sternum extending well below the umbilicus (belly button). <br /><br /> The residents, medical students, and I reviewed her CT images. In addition to the large mass arising from the greater curvature of her stomach, there were two 4 cm metastases in her left liver and one similar size lesion in the right liver. GIST frequently metastasizes to the liver. These tumors can be treated with a medication called imatinib, a drug targeted to a specific genetic gain-of-function mutation in a tyrosine kinase receptor called c-KIT. This patient had already been started on oral imatinib, but she was extremely symptomatic with poor appetite, early satiety, and was requiring weekly blood transfusions for persistent bleeding from the ulcerated stomach tumor. I had a long discussion with the patient and her daughters, and after answering all questions and discussing alternatives, they agreed to an operation early the next week to remove the malignant stomach tumor and treat the three large liver metastases.<br /><br />Removal of the giant tumor<br /><br /> A few days before the operation we transfused the patient with two units of packed red blood cells because her hemoglobin level, which should be 12-15 gm/dL, was only 6.5 gm/dL the day I saw her in clinic. We started the operation with an incision from the tip of her sternum, called the xiphoid, to her belly button. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the soccer-ball size mass protruded from the incision. As expected from the endoscopy and CT findings, despite the large size of the tumor, it arose from a short segment along the lower aspect of the stomach. Working with a chief resident, we dissected this sizable tumor free from the surrounding structures adherent to it, including the pancreas, duodenum, and the transverse colon. Once the tumor was dissected free from all of these structures, it was a simple matter of firing a gastrointestinal stapling device twice along the greater curvature of her stomach assuring we were clear of the malignant tumor. The tumor and a small volume of her stomach was removed entirely.<br /><br />  <br /><br /><br /><br />                      Removed gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of 23 cm in diameter.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Earlier in my career, if I wanted a picture of a tumor or a photograph during an operation, I had to arrange for a certified medical photographer to join us in the operating room. One of the joys and advantages (or disadvantages) of modern technology is all surgeons are now their own photographer using their cellular telephones. Patients, including this lady and her daughters, often ask me to take a picture to show them the offending malignancy. I wanted to take the large stomach tumor over to pathology myself, so I removed my surgical gown and gloves and took a couple of quick cell phone photos of the tumor with a sterile measuring tape placed below it to provide a size reference. I never place any patient names or numbers in these photos, and I always delete the images from my phone after sharing them with the patient and their families. Patient privacy and confidentiality must be conserved and respected!<br /><br /> I carried the bucket containing the gastric GIST over to pathology, and our pathologist confirmed the resection margins were tumor-free. I scrubbed my hands again and re-gowned and gloved. We removed the left liver containing the two large tumors. Intraoperative liver ultrasound revealed about a dozen small tumors (3-4 mm) scattered throughout liver. This was not an unexpected finding with a GIST, and I knew treatment with imatinib could successfully control these small tumors for many years.  The larger tumor in the right lobe was deep in the liver, but was easily destroyed completely using ultrasound-guided microwave ablation. At the conclusion of the operation, it was easy to sew close the abdominal wall muscles because there was no longer a large tumor protruding and pressing outward.<br /><br />“Do you have pictures of Mom’s cancer?”  <br /><br /> I walked out to speak with the patient’s daughters and described the findings and results of the operation. I reported their mother was stable and did very well throughout the operation. She required no blood transfusions and was resting comfortably in the recovery room. The eldest daughter finally asked the question I expected, “Do you have pictures of Mom’s cancer?” <br /><br /> I hesitated briefly as a few of the daughters squirmed or grimaced, and then responded, “In fact, I have some on my phone. Be careful what you wish for; are you sure you want to see this?”<br /><br /> After quickly exchanging glances among themselves, all agreed they wanted to see photos revealing the appearance of the large tumor corresponding to the CT images I had shown them in the office. I opened the photos on my phone and was met with common exclamations of disbelief and incredulity. The usual questions ensued, “Oh my God, how can some thing like that grow in our mother?”<br /><br /> “How could she be walking around with that thing in her?”<br /><br /> “You said that thing is 23 cm in diameter. What is a centimeter? How many inches is that?  How on earth can something that big not just kill you outright?”<br /><br /> All good questions ladies. I converted centimeters into inches for them, but still sensing some uncertainty, I finished the conversion for them by saying, “Surgeons like to compare the size of tumors to common objects like food. Your mother had the equivalent of a large canteloupe melon in her belly.”<br /><br /> The whole family was stunned. As more family members arrived, each wanted to see the pictures of the incomprehensibly large GIST. Low whistles, exclamations of amazement, or grunts of distress and disgust emitted from each individual who saw the images.<br /><br />Happy ending<br /><br /> Happily, this delightful lady recovered from her operation quickly and uneventfully. On the evening of surgery she grasped my hand, and eyes brimming with tears, thanked me for removing the large mass. She stated unequivocally she felt better than she had in months, and the sensations of heaviness, pressure, and discomfort had vanished. She had minimal pain from her abdominal incision and was discharged from the hospital four days after the procedure. When I saw the patient and several of her daughters back in the office for her first post-operative visit, they asked for more details about the tumor. I reported, like a pediatrician would do with a newborn baby, the pathologist had weighed her tumor. It came in at a whopping 2.3 kilograms, or just over 5 pounds! Despite the presence of stage IV disease with several remaining small liver metastases, this patient in all probability will live many more years thanks to the availability of the targeted drug imatinib. The patient now has a slightly concave rather than a very protuberant abdomen, and she is able to eat full-sized meals and enjoy her children and grandchildren.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Keep reading:<br /><br />That Thing Was Growing Inside Me?

261	99	2	What All Parents Should Know About IVs	By Heather Michon |<br /><br /><br /><br /> Caitlin King only got to hold her newborn twin girls for a few precious moments before they were whisked off to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). That’s where their journey began. Born at 32 weeks and six days, Abbie May and Gardner Grace weighed just four pounds each.<br /><br /> Caitlin describes the NICU as a whirlwind, filled with fragile little babies attended by a team of nurses. “[They were] the most amazing people I’ve ever experienced,” says Caitlin. “The NICU nurses were everything to us.”<br /><br /> She was awakened in the middle of the night by the news that the medical team was having a hard time finding good veins on the girls’ limbs. The nurse requested permission to insert intravenous (IV) lines into their bellybuttons.<br /><br /> The umbilical vein remains viable for about a week after birth and it is sometimes used to take blood samples. Umbilical vein catheterization (UVC) is recommended when good peripheral veins can’t be found, but it does carry risks. Some of the complications include a potential for infection, bleeding from the umbilical vein, and embolism.<br /><br /> Caitlin gave her consent, but was concerned for her daughters. “After the nurse left, I just lost it. I started crying and it just sounded so scary,” she admits.<br /><br /> The umbilical line worked for Gardner Grace, but not for twin sister Abbie May. Staff finally inserted the catheter into a vein in Abbie May’s scalp.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Scalp vein catheterization is even less common than a UVC and most consider it a last resort. In some ways, it’s an excellent location: there are several veins in a newborn’s skull that are easy to visualize and because a baby tends not to move their head the way they move their limbs, the catheter is less likely to be dislodged. Statistically, it seems to carry no greater risk than a line in the arm or the leg. However, it’s avoided when possible because it’s more upsetting for parents, especially since it often requires the area to be shaved and can leave a scar.<br /><br /><br />  Caitlin had previously worked on a project with a medical research company, giving her some familiarity with IVs.  “Every NICU nurse we had, I told them ‘I don’t know anything about medical stuff except IV infiltration. So you have to make sure that my kids’ IVs don’t infiltrate,’” she laughs.<br /><br />  One day, she looked at Abbie May’s scalp and thought the area around the catheter looked puffy–one of the primary signs of infiltration. She called the nurse over to check it, and the nurse agreed that she was also concerned when she looked at it. Examination showed the catheter had infiltrated and was leaking fluid into the surrounding tissue. It was quickly removed. After 15 days in the NICU, the newborns were discharged from the hospital and finally got to go home.<br /><br /><br /><br />  While Caitlin believes the nurse probably would have discovered the infiltration herself, she’s glad she was able to have an active role in her newborns’ care.<br /><br />  “I was pretty proud that I knew there was something wrong and was able to point out to the nurse that it didn’t look right.”<br /><br />  In a situation where she felt powerless, this was something she had done that helped her babies.<br /><br />  It was a boost of confidence in a stressful time. “If, as a parent, I can be aware and say ‘look, I think something’s wrong here,’ and bring attention to something a doctor or nurse may be missing–because they’re human and sometimes we miss things–then I’ll do it.”<br /><br /><br /><br />  Now the mom of two healthy, active three-year-olds, Caitlin hopes other parents take from her experience the importance of educating themselves when it comes to kids and IVs. “There’s no awareness about IVs, it’s not talked about, and yet it happens every day,” she says. “As a parent, feeling helpless is one of the worst feelings in the world. If there’s something you can do when it comes to knowing what to look for, do it.”<br /><br />  Do you have an IV story to share?

262	99	2	IV Complications: What Can Go Wrong?	https://www.myiv.com/iv-complications/<br /><br /> By: Ryan MacArthur <br /><br />Full story:<br /><br /> The use of intravenous (IV) therapy is more common than ever. While it’s an extremely valuable tool for healthcare professionals, patients and providers must know and understand the risks associated with IV therapy.<br /><br /> Infiltrations<br /><br /> The delivery of fluid and/or medication outside the vein and into the surrounding soft tissue. An infiltration can occur for a number of reasons, such as leakage from the insertion site or catheter dislodgement. Patients will see swelling of the soft tissue surrounding the IV, and the skin will feel cool, firm, and pale. Small amounts of IV fluid aren’t typically life-threatening but some medications, even in small doses, can be very toxic to the surrounding soft tissue.<br /><br /> Extravasations<br /><br /> The infiltration of a blistering agent (also known as a vesicant) into the surrounding IV site as the result of leakage from a vein. Vesicants can cause tissue destruction and result in pain at the IV site and along the vein. Because chemotherapy medications are highly toxic, extravasation is especially dangerous.<br /><br /> Hematoma<br /><br /> The leakage of blood from the vein into the surrounding soft tissue. This can occur when an IV angiocatheter goes through more than one wall of a vein or if pressure is not applied to the IV site when the catheter is removed.<br /><br /> Phlebitis and Thrombophlebitis<br /><br /> Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein, while thrombophlebitis refers to inflammation associated with a blood clot within the vascular system. Both are more common on the backside of the hand than on the upper part of the elbow and may occur in hospitalized patients where an IV has been in place for several days.<br /><br /> Air Embolism<br /><br /> A result of a large volume of air entering the patient’s vein via the IV. When an air bubble enters a vein or artery, it can cause life-threatening blockages. In order to prevent air bubbles from forming, clinicians will keep the IV bag from moving and ensure it is it remains hanging vertically.<br /><br /><br />  References:<br /><br />   Everything you need to know about air bubbles in your patient’s IV line https://thenursepath.blog/2016/12/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-air-bubbles-in-your-patients-iv-line/<br /><br />   Know the Difference Between Infiltration vs. Extravasation https://www.rn.com/nursing-news/know-the-difference-infiltration-vs-extravasation/<br /><br />   Air Embolism http://www.healthline.com/health/air-embolism#overview1<br /><br />   Medical Emergencies and Complications http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/aegd/mod01_mec_ivcomp.html<br /><br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 16.01.2018.

263	101	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care.

264	103	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

265	103	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

266	103	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement.

278	107	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

279	107	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

280	107	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

281	108	2	All You Need to Know about Prescription Opiates	An increase in aging population combined with the rising prevalence of diseases like diabetic neuropathy, arthritis, and cancer has led to the growth of the global pain relief market. Topical analgesics, NSAIDs, and opiates make up a huge segment of this market, and are prescribed by health professionals to treat mild to severe and chronic pain.<br /> While there are some safety issues related to an important class of NSAIDs called Cox-2 inhibitors- which has subsequently led to market withdrawals- , opioid medications are notorious for making a person physically dependent on them. Despite this, opiates are used increasingly to relieve pain, especially in cases where ordinary pain medications have been ineffective or for people who cannot take NSAIDs due to heart, kidney, or liver problems.<br /> Opiate drugs can be effective when prescribed for short-term treatment, considering they are potent pain relievers and also have positive psychological properties. However, the risk of physical dependency and addiction is high when opiates are taken in high doses and for longer periods, and without a prescription.<br /> If you are looking for more information on opiates and their side-effects, and on opiate withdrawal, read on.What Are Opiates and How Do They Work?<br /><br /> Opiates or opioids are a group of natural, synthetic, or partially synthetic drugs that are derived from the poppy plant or synthesized chemically in laboratories. Opiates include legal drugs like morphine, oxycodone, and codeine, as well as illegal drugs like heroin.<br /> Opiates being narcotic medications, target opioid receptors in the brain and the central nervous system, thereby reducing pain. These drugs are commonly prescribed by health professionals to help manage pain. Narcotic elements in medications vary greatly, which is why it is important to follow the advice of a health professional when taking these drugs.What Are the Side-Effects of Opiates?<br /> Like other drugs, using opiates can cause a sense of elation, breathlessness, depressed respiration, fatigue, nausea, and confusion. Taking lethal doses of opioids can also result in death.<br /> Using opioids for longer than prescribed by a health professional can cause the user to develop physical dependence and tolerance. This means that the body adjusts to the presence of opiates over time, and requires a higher quantity of drugs to produce the same effect.<br /> Further, prolonged usage of opioids may damage the brain which can in turn stop the body from producing endorphins- a neurotransmitter that is a natural painkiller. Addiction to opiates can also be accompanied by mental disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, and antisocial personality disorder.What Are the Signs of Opiate Abuse?<br /> Individuals using opiates for longer than prescribed, taking them in larger amounts, or spending a lot of time on obtaining and using drugs are most certainly physically dependent on opiates or addicted to them.<br /> In addition to this, mood or psychological symptoms like psychosis, euphoria, depression, increased self-esteem, lowered motivation, anxiety, and irritability also point to opiate dependence. Physical signs of opiate abuse include improved alertness, increased energy, high blood pressure, low appetite, high sensitivity to sensory stimuli, etc.What Are the Causes of Prescription Opiate Addiction?<br /> While not all individuals become addicted to prescription opiates, the exact reason for a person developing an addiction to these drugs cannot be determined. Opiate addiction can be the result of a number of factors including genetic, psychological, or environmental.<br /> For example, an individual who has a close relative with an addiction disorder might be more likely to develop an addiction. Also, individuals that have an inborn deficit of endorphins or those that have been brought up in a chaotic home environment are more likely to get addicted to opiates.<br /> Moreover, individuals that feel their pain isn’t getting any better or those that feel as good as they do when under medication are likely to self-prescribe opiates and abuse them.What Is Opiate Withdrawal?<br /> Individuals that discontinue or dramatically reduce the intake of opiates after prolonged and heavy use, experience a range of symptoms referred to as opiate withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include restlessness, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, insomnia, excessive sweating, and anxiety.<br /><br /><br /> Prescription opiate addiction needs to be treated with just as much care as any other substance addiction. Using natural remedies and eating healthy can make opiate withdrawal easy. Taking appropriate medications to deal with the uneasiness is recommended.What Are the Global Statistics?<br /> According to reports, prescription drug abuse has risen significantly in the last decade in the US. While the abuse of prescription opiates hasn't reached pandemic levels all over the globe, it certainly is a cause for concern.<br /> As per the 2014 Global Drug Survey (GDS2014) conducted during November-December 2013, which was the biggest survey of its kinds and saw 18 countries participating, an average of 5% respondents had used cannabis in the last year.<br /> Earlier reports have suggested that heroin and other opioids had an estimated 12-21 million global users. Furthermore, the INCB has pointed out that North America consumes 80% of the world's opioids, plus has the highest rate of drug-related deaths in the world. Additionally, it has been noted that men are twice as likely as women to abuse prescription opiates.Conclusion<br /> While opiate drugs are highly effective in the treatment of certain chronic pains, using them for a prolonged time, especially without a doctor’s prescription can prove to be dangerous. Since prescription opiates are broadly marketed, it can be difficult to think of them as harmful, but knowing the dangers involved and using medication wisely is sure to help individuals stay safe and healthy.<br />Article last time updated on 29.01.2016.

282	109	2	What All Parents Should Know About IVs	By Heather Michon |<br /><br /><br /><br /> Caitlin King only got to hold her newborn twin girls for a few precious moments before they were whisked off to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). That’s where their journey began. Born at 32 weeks and six days, Abbie May and Gardner Grace weighed just four pounds each.<br /><br /> Caitlin describes the NICU as a whirlwind, filled with fragile little babies attended by a team of nurses. “[They were] the most amazing people I’ve ever experienced,” says Caitlin. “The NICU nurses were everything to us.”<br /><br /> She was awakened in the middle of the night by the news that the medical team was having a hard time finding good veins on the girls’ limbs. The nurse requested permission to insert intravenous (IV) lines into their bellybuttons.<br /><br /> The umbilical vein remains viable for about a week after birth and it is sometimes used to take blood samples. Umbilical vein catheterization (UVC) is recommended when good peripheral veins can’t be found, but it does carry risks. Some of the complications include a potential for infection, bleeding from the umbilical vein, and embolism.<br /><br /> Caitlin gave her consent, but was concerned for her daughters. “After the nurse left, I just lost it. I started crying and it just sounded so scary,” she admits.<br /><br /> The umbilical line worked for Gardner Grace, but not for twin sister Abbie May. Staff finally inserted the catheter into a vein in Abbie May’s scalp.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Scalp vein catheterization is even less common than a UVC and most consider it a last resort. In some ways, it’s an excellent location: there are several veins in a newborn’s skull that are easy to visualize and because a baby tends not to move their head the way they move their limbs, the catheter is less likely to be dislodged. Statistically, it seems to carry no greater risk than a line in the arm or the leg. However, it’s avoided when possible because it’s more upsetting for parents, especially since it often requires the area to be shaved and can leave a scar.<br /><br /><br />  Caitlin had previously worked on a project with a medical research company, giving her some familiarity with IVs.  “Every NICU nurse we had, I told them ‘I don’t know anything about medical stuff except IV infiltration. So you have to make sure that my kids’ IVs don’t infiltrate,’” she laughs.<br /><br />  One day, she looked at Abbie May’s scalp and thought the area around the catheter looked puffy–one of the primary signs of infiltration. She called the nurse over to check it, and the nurse agreed that she was also concerned when she looked at it. Examination showed the catheter had infiltrated and was leaking fluid into the surrounding tissue. It was quickly removed. After 15 days in the NICU, the newborns were discharged from the hospital and finally got to go home.<br /><br /><br /><br />  While Caitlin believes the nurse probably would have discovered the infiltration herself, she’s glad she was able to have an active role in her newborns’ care.<br /><br />  “I was pretty proud that I knew there was something wrong and was able to point out to the nurse that it didn’t look right.”<br /><br />  In a situation where she felt powerless, this was something she had done that helped her babies.<br /><br />  It was a boost of confidence in a stressful time. “If, as a parent, I can be aware and say ‘look, I think something’s wrong here,’ and bring attention to something a doctor or nurse may be missing–because they’re human and sometimes we miss things–then I’ll do it.”<br /><br /><br /><br />  Now the mom of two healthy, active three-year-olds, Caitlin hopes other parents take from her experience the importance of educating themselves when it comes to kids and IVs. “There’s no awareness about IVs, it’s not talked about, and yet it happens every day,” she says. “As a parent, feeling helpless is one of the worst feelings in the world. If there’s something you can do when it comes to knowing what to look for, do it.”<br /><br />  Do you have an IV story to share?

283	109	2	IV Complications: What Can Go Wrong?	https://www.myiv.com/iv-complications/<br /><br /> By: Ryan MacArthur <br /><br />Full story:<br /><br /> The use of intravenous (IV) therapy is more common than ever. While it’s an extremely valuable tool for healthcare professionals, patients and providers must know and understand the risks associated with IV therapy.<br /><br /> Infiltrations<br /><br /> The delivery of fluid and/or medication outside the vein and into the surrounding soft tissue. An infiltration can occur for a number of reasons, such as leakage from the insertion site or catheter dislodgement. Patients will see swelling of the soft tissue surrounding the IV, and the skin will feel cool, firm, and pale. Small amounts of IV fluid aren’t typically life-threatening but some medications, even in small doses, can be very toxic to the surrounding soft tissue.<br /><br /> Extravasations<br /><br /> The infiltration of a blistering agent (also known as a vesicant) into the surrounding IV site as the result of leakage from a vein. Vesicants can cause tissue destruction and result in pain at the IV site and along the vein. Because chemotherapy medications are highly toxic, extravasation is especially dangerous.<br /><br /> Hematoma<br /><br /> The leakage of blood from the vein into the surrounding soft tissue. This can occur when an IV angiocatheter goes through more than one wall of a vein or if pressure is not applied to the IV site when the catheter is removed.<br /><br /> Phlebitis and Thrombophlebitis<br /><br /> Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein, while thrombophlebitis refers to inflammation associated with a blood clot within the vascular system. Both are more common on the backside of the hand than on the upper part of the elbow and may occur in hospitalized patients where an IV has been in place for several days.<br /><br /> Air Embolism<br /><br /> A result of a large volume of air entering the patient’s vein via the IV. When an air bubble enters a vein or artery, it can cause life-threatening blockages. In order to prevent air bubbles from forming, clinicians will keep the IV bag from moving and ensure it is it remains hanging vertically.<br /><br /><br />  References:<br /><br />   Everything you need to know about air bubbles in your patient’s IV line https://thenursepath.blog/2016/12/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-air-bubbles-in-your-patients-iv-line/<br /><br />   Know the Difference Between Infiltration vs. Extravasation https://www.rn.com/nursing-news/know-the-difference-infiltration-vs-extravasation/<br /><br />   Air Embolism http://www.healthline.com/health/air-embolism#overview1<br /><br />   Medical Emergencies and Complications http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/aegd/mod01_mec_ivcomp.html<br /><br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 16.01.2018.

284	110	2	Emotional Effect on Women That Have an Abortion	In general, we find that abortion is very stressful for women. It is not easy when they decide to terminate a pregnancy. First of all, falling pregnant can already be stressful, especially if it comes with certain medical problems, when it’s unwanted, or even in rape cases.<br /><br /> Furthermore, we find that directly after a woman has had an abortion, she might experience unexpected emotions and reactions. Sometimes it’s also difficult to discuss it due to religious and cultural reasons. Many women might feel emotional distress and guilt caused by religious beliefs that normally creates a stigma concerning abortions.<br /><br /> However, most emotional and psychological responses related to an abortion is normal. Yet, it shouldn’t be severe or persistent enough to affect their daily lifestyle, it typically fades on its own.<br /><br />Some of these feelings naturally can include the following:<br /><br /> Loss of her self-esteem<br /><br /> Stress that can reduce her ability to cope<br /><br /> Regret or remorse<br /><br /> Guilt<br /><br /> Grief due to the sense of loss<br /><br /> Relief or anxiety<br /><br /> Not every woman will experience emotional responses that are negative with an abortion. Those that do shouldn’t have problems concerning their mental health that is lasting. Some might react positive and feel relief without any regrets. This is because they feel confident that their decision was a choice that is right for them. <br /><br /> About depression<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a mental or psychological condition of your health, also known as a mood disorder.<br /><br /> Some symptoms and signs you might experience when you are depressed can include:<br /><br /> Sleep patterns that are disturbed<br /><br /> Losing interest in any activities you used to enjoy<br /><br /> Lose your interest in having intercourse<br /><br /> Tiredness or lack of energy<br /><br /> Irritable feelings<br /><br /> Feeling guilty<br /><br /> Concentration that is poor, plus finds it difficult to make decisions<br /><br /> Your ability to think can be reduced<br /><br /> Experiencing sadness or feeling low<br /><br /> Depression can develop at various severity levels. Women that have a mild condition will be able to perform her activities daily with some ease. However, when depression is severe it can affect her life so dramatically that she won’t be able to work. It may also cause other mental issues that are more serious, like psychosis.<br /><br /> Feelings of self-harm or suicide are symptoms that are very serious and they will need help urgently. Depression may not be a reason for physical changes but sometimes depressed patients can talk very slowly. It might also have other effects such as loss of appetite which could cause loss of weight and even anorexia or bulimia.<br /><br /> Grief or depression due to an abortion<br /><br /> Grief is a reaction that is naturally occurring with the death of a loved one, but it shouldn’t cause depression over a long term.<br /><br /> To experience loss after termination of an unplanned pregnancy can also be natural, like due to an injury or illness. Yet, in this case, because of a spontaneous abortion, the symptoms might not last very long.<br /><br /> Most of the time, even if a woman decides on an abortion to terminate a pregnancy, she will still experience feelings that are natural of regret, guilt, grief, sadness, and loss afterward.<br /><br /> Risk factors for depression<br /><br /> Women with mental disorders prior to unwanted pregnancies who goes for an abortion can experience it differently as what healthy women would. They might be at a higher risk to develop depression after the procedure.<br /><br />These risk factors may include:<br /><br /> If they previously had childbirth that was unwanted<br /><br /> In the case of alcohol or drug use<br /><br /> A history of emotional or violence problems<br /><br /> With poverty<br /><br /> Genetics can also be linked to a very high risk of developing depression after an abortion. This means if any of their relatives also experienced depression as an illness factor, it will be more likely for a woman to experience it herself.<br /><br /> Specific events in life may trigger depressive episodes. These include such as rape or physical abuse and it can trigger depression that is severe after an abortion as it may cause a feeling of loss and separation.<br /><br /> It’s important for any woman making the choice to go for an abortion, no matter what the reason might be, to consult a professional for help before and after the procedure. Doctors have the experience to help you understand what you can expect during the abortion and afterward. and may recommend sessions with professional staff to help you through this emotional time.<br />Article last time updated on 01.01.2018.

286	110	2	Treatments Used in Dental Habit Therapy That Can Help Your Child	It’s possible for anyone to develop bad habits during their life. In some cases, young children may have bad habits that could actually influence the function and development of their mouth, teeth, and jaws. Examples of this can be thumb sucking, mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting that are persistent.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The reflex of sucking can be a natural occurrence among children at an early age, which normally disappears between the ages of two and four years. However, if the problem persists after four years, the pressure on their upper jaw and front teeth may cause teeth to start moving apart. Plus, it can result in the jaw changing its shape. This conditions might impair their speech and also cause an open bite problem.<br /><br /> With mouth breathing, which relates to a pattern of breathing that is not normal, causing their mouths to remain always open. This can pass direct air into the lungs, and cause muscular alteration functions of their face and tongue. The lower and upper jaw may abnormally grow and cause orthodontic conditions that can be serious.<br /><br /> Some issues that will need habit therapy among children<br /><br /> Two issues that are known to be the biggest problem in children concerning bad habits can include finger or thumb sucking, plus tongue thrusting. The thrusting of the tongue can occur if a child pushes his/her tongue forward onto the teeth constantly. Most of the time they will outgrow such a habit at around four years old. Although, if it doesn’t happen, it may cause their teeth to misalign.<br /><br /> Side effects from misalignment might seriously affect how a child’s face looks. It’s important that you consult a professional dentist for correcting the problems since the child at such a young age won’t understand any of the consequences.<br /><br /> Thumb sucking treatment using orthodontic appliances<br /><br /><br /><br /> When your child persistently sucks his/her thumb, consider getting orthodontic treatment early for stopping this behavior, as well as preventing problems from developing. It’s important to help the child understand what problems can be associated with this habit and suggest different ways to stop it.<br /><br /> Different ways to try and stop the habit may include reminding them about the dangers of the habit. Additionally, at night time place a hand puppet, sock or mitten over the hand. Furthermore, consider using an elbow elastic support that might make it difficult for bending his/her elbow to prevent thumb sucking. Sometimes, these habits are an emotional comfort device and scolding can only worsen the situation.<br /><br /> However, when it doesn’t help, your dentist may suggest an orthodontic appliance, known as a tongue crib which painlessly and gently will stop thumb sucking completely. This treatment can physically prevent the habit and typically, your child’s habit should be over within a couple of months if wearing this appliance.<br /><br /> Treatment appliances for tongue thrusting<br /><br /> This habit happens when your child pushes his or her tongue against the teeth in front while they are swallowing or speaking. A parent might feel it’s not a big issue, though, as time goes by the pressure that is exerted through their tongue onto the teeth may relate to orthodontic open bite problems.<br /><br /> An appliance for tongue thrusting will correct such behavior and prevent the child from thrusting his/her tongue against the teeth. Thus, it can allow the teeth to develop as it should.<br /><br /> This appliance can be placed in a comfortable and safe way to correct the child’s habit. It’s a semi-permanent attachment to the teeth very similar to the way braces are fitted. For the duration it is worn, it will guide the child to correct his/her patterns of behavior. Sometimes it might also be recommended for a child to get a speech or exercise therapy together with such a dental appliance.<br /><br /> Sometimes success can be reached after only a couple of days. All the same, the time it takes doesn’t really matter because once the orthodontist can confirm your child is over the habit, they will remove the appliance. It’s very similar to a palatal crib which may typically be used for preventing a child to suck his/her thumb, it only differs from what this crib actually blocks.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

287	110	2	What Platelet Lysate Treatments Do	Normally Platelets found in the body releases in a slow manner some growth factors to promote healing. Granting, at times the doctor might need to contain these growth factors within platelets so that it’s immediately accessible for promoting healing faster. This is used in areas that are affected by disease or damage.<br /><br /> However, in certain areas of your body where doctors use PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, it might cause a lot of inflammation. Therefore, they prefer to create a Platelet Lysate solution. This is done by cracking the Platelets open and allowing all growth factors to promptly be released into your body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a purely concentrated solution of the growth factors found in plasma once platelets were removed and activated. This regenerative solution that doctor’s use has minimal inflammatory reactions and it’s immediately very active. It’s a preferred solution to treat areas of injured nerves, new stem cells, and in your epidural space.<br /><br /> How effective is therapy with Platelet Lysate?<br /><br /> This procedure can provide relief for a variety of conditions, although, it may vary in effectiveness. It helps the body to do what comes naturally, yet, because every patient’s healing process is different, it will reflect those results. This means that some patients might only need a single treatment, where others will require additional treatments.<br /><br /> Additionally, the reaction may depend on the following factors.<br /><br /> Different conditions or health factors that may attribute to slow healing<br /><br /> Activities after the treatment<br /><br /> Your overall health condition<br /><br /> Response and status of your immune system<br /><br /> Degrees of the damage<br /><br /> The specific area that is damaged<br /><br /> A patient’s age<br /><br /> Advantages of this therapy<br /><br /> There are many advantages with such an innovative therapy which can outweigh problems commonly related to different treatments like steroid injections or surgeries.<br /><br /> Advantages of Platelet Lysate therapy may include the following:<br /><br /> It’s related to healing over the long-term<br /><br /> Easy to perform and prepare<br /><br /> Less inflammatory effects<br /><br /> Recovery periods can be short<br /><br /> Natural cell regeneration<br /><br /> Using a person’s own power of healing<br /><br /> Non-invasive procedure<br /><br /> Such a procedure speeds up the process of natural healing due to the fact that growth factors can be available immediately to tissues that are damaged. It will be directly injected into the area that is damaged, immediately starting the process of healing.<br /><br /> It’s possible to apply Platelet Lysate treatment therapy any number of times. This will depend on what your body may need. When experiencing great improvement its fine to slow down or even stop treatments. On the other hand, when the body is in need of extra support, there won’t be a problem to carry on with the treatment.<br /><br /><br /><br /> About advanced PRP and Platelet Lysate procedures<br /><br /> Treatments with injections of PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, as well as Platelet Lysate contains components of healing and growths that is collected from a person’s own blood. This is used to increase the body’s ability of naturally repairing itself.<br /><br /> These procedures can be used to repair muscle, ligament, tendon, and joint injuries. Thus, it has become very popular among professional athletes. The injections are very effective due to the fact that it stimulates stem cells in the area that is targeted. It promotes those cells to work harder on tissue that is damaged for quicker healing. It is generally used for conditions of the spine, injuries of soft tissues, and mild arthritis.<br /><br /> The procedure of Platelet Lysate therapy<br /><br /> This procedure has less pain and fewer complications than what surgery offers. The doctor will discuss your condition and how the therapy can help you. Together a decision might be made whether it may be right for you.<br /><br /> It’s a fairly simple procedure and the following steps can be done:<br /><br /> To re-inject a mixture of Platelet Lysate into tissues that are damaged, cells are removed from a person’s own blood.<br /><br /> A tiny sample of the blood gets collected to separate platelets out of other components of the blood in order to create PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma.<br /><br /> This will then be subjected to a couple of series of freezing and thawing cycles. This carefully breaks the platelets apart to release its growth factors.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The Platelet Lysate results can then be combined together with just a tiny quantity of some anti-inflammatory medication such as Dexamethasone prior to being injected. Once done, it is injected into the area that is damaged using fluoroscopy or ultrasound which is guided techniques.<br /><br /> Once the procedure is done, you need to plan for enough rest, plus restricting activities for at least forty-eight hours. It might take some time before you will realize that the treatment is working. But once your activities or movements increases and you experience less pain you will know. You can decrease or increase treatments depending on how you feel.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-10 00:00:00	349	m2m
288	110	2	Can Perineal Massage Help You Avoid the Episiotomy?	Labor is a very painful and intense ordeal. The duration of this experience depends a lot on the strength of the contractions, the size of the baby, and the anatomy of the birth canal. The perineum is the area of the body between the anus and the vulva. You should rub or knead the muscles in order to relieve muscle tension. Perineal massage consists in rubbing or kneading the perineal muscles of a pregnant woman in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to allow these muscles and the surrounding tissue of the birth canal to stretch and relax prior delivery so an episiotomy can be avoided. When the canal birth is too narrow and when the baby is putting too much pressure on this area during childbirth, an episiotomy is required. An episiotomy is a cutting of the muscular area, commonly known as the perineum in order to help enlarge the vaginal opening during childbirth.<br /><br /> This area is exactly located between the vagina and the anus. It is normally done when the perineum is too rigid and too tight to allow a normal and easy delivery. It is also done to prevent tearing of the perineal wall as the baby tries to pass through the birth canal. It is also performed in order to allow a fast delivery of the baby. An episiotomy is seen as a necessary evil because, despite the practical reasons for doing it, it leads to some extra pain and discomfort after birth.<br /><br /> This can last up to a couple of days or a couple of weeks. It also changes the structure of the perineum permanently, as most of the muscles get replaced by a scar tissue. To reduce the possibility of an episiotomy, or a perineal tear, several practices have been tried over the years, and perineal massage is one of those. Perineal massage has a long and rich history, with the Chukchi Eskimos in Siberia using glass bottles and African tribes using gourds.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to increase the size of the vaginal canal and to increase the elasticity of the perineal area. The beautiful thing about a perineal massage is that it is relatively easy to perform. It does not require any special equipment, and you or your partner can do it in the absence of any medical professional. The massage is preferably done after taking a bath. You will need to take a comfortable position, wash your hands and lubricate your thumb with a water-based lubricant.<br /><br /> You can choose natural lubricants like olive oil or almond oil if you prefer. Once the hands are cleaned and lubricated, you need to place the thumb inside the vagina. The thumb should be inserted until the first knuckle of it is at the same level with the mouth of the vagina. This means that about 1-1.5 inches of your thumb would be inserted into the vagina. With the thumbs still in the vagina, push downwards towards the direction of the anus, and outwards towards the sides.<br /><br /> Keep pushing till you feel a burning and a stretching sensation. Hold your thumbs in place at this point for a minute or two. After that move your thumbs in around the lower half of the vagina by moving in a “U” shape from side to side for about 10 minutes. That way you will massage the side walls and the base of the vagina as well. Like massages on every other part of the body, it is not a one-time procedure, but should be done repeatedly.<br /><br /> Some experts recommend 6-10 sessions starting from 4-6 weeks before expected due date and continuing until the child is born. Interestingly, the upper half of the vagina does not need to be massaged, as it is surrounded by bones. The urethra is also found in this area, and any attempt to massage it may lead to some level of discomfort and even urinary tract infections.<br /><br /> You will want to avoid the upper half of the vagina during the perineal massage as you won’t have any profit from it. Women have reported an increase in the width of their birth canal with each session of perineal massage. Certain researchers have also been conducted in order to show the effectiveness of the perineal massage in preventing perineal tears and episiotomy during delivery.<br /><br /> One of such research's in the UK noted that there was a 6.1% reduction in second and third - degree tears. And there were episiotomies in women who did perineal massage during the last month of their pregnancy. The effects were higher in women over the age of 30 years old who were having their first baby. This is probably because of the fact that older women normally have a more rigid perineum compared to women at their 20’s.<br /><br /> The perineal massage helps widen the birth canal and make its walls more elastic and less likely to tear. In younger women who were having their first babies, the effect on their still elastic perineum is minimal. For women who have had previous episiotomies and women who had perineal tears in their previous pregnancies, perineal massage does not have much effect. This is due to the fact that the scar tissue is already formed by the previous damage to the perineum.<br /><br /> Normally, this scar tissue is not that strong as the muscle is. Therefore, despite the massage, there is a minimal change in the width of their birth canal. However, these women can still need an episiotomy during the childbirth. Despite the effectiveness of the perineal massage, there are some people who it is not recommended for. These include women who have had preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes in the past, or currently have a vaginal infection.<br /><br /> It is also wise to stop perineal massage if it causes discomfort or stimulates contraction. Whether or not you decide to try the perineal massage, it is very important that you keep your appointments with your obstetrician. No amount of personal research can replace the competence of a skilled physician.<br /><br /><br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-01 00:00:00	379	m2m
289	110	2	Why Would Couples Choose a Procedure for Gender Selection?	Most couples would like to have children of both sexes, especially in our current way of life where more and more people prefer smaller families. This is due to the fact that everything is so expensive. With today technology it’s possible for doctors through fertility treatments that are more advanced, to identify female and male embryos.<br /><br /> This option is available to couples today. In addition, couples can now also avoid passing on genetic sex-linked disorders to their children. The same goes for parents that want to balance their family and already have a child or children of one sex. Choosing a child’s gender has been subjected to a variety of debates quite extensively due to ART/assisted reproductive technology since it started.<br /><br /><br /><br /> I was very lucky through the conventional way to have two children and one of each gender. Yet, many couples might try for conceiving a boy or a girl and don’t see success until maybe the fifth time. By selecting your baby’s gender which is also called family balancing, it’s possible to have both sexes and keep the family smaller. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> In certain countries, this procedure might only be permitted for preventing transmission of genetic sex-linked diseases. Although, in others, it can be a practice that is common in fertility clinics.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> During development of an embryo, the differentiation of gender may occur prior to fertilization. It’s usually determined by the contribution of genetic material of a father’s sperm because he carries an X and Y chromosome which is responsible for a baby’s gender. Women’s egg cells carry only the X chromosome which means the combination can either be XX for a girl and XY for a boy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to this factor, selecting a gender may involve manipulation during an early stage of embryonic development or fertilization. Techniques of assisted reproduction can allow couples in choosing their baby’s gender during these specific stages.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Stages may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br />Before you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This involves a procedure to choose a sperm for a couple’s desired gender prior to fertilization and allow the fertility doctor to perform it without using IVF. <br /><br />  <br /><br />After you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The doctor selects an embryo for the gender that is desired directly after it’s fertilized and then transfers the embryo back into the uterus of the mother.<br /><br />  <br /><br />While a woman is pregnant<br /><br /><br /><br /> In this case, a woman can voluntarily terminate her pregnancy, if the baby is not the gender they desire, which is called sex-selective abortion.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to reasons that are ethical, this type of abortion won’t be a recommended technique in choosing an unborn baby’s gender. Although, woman have the option to choose a VTOP/voluntary termination of pregnancy, which will purely depend on their choice.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Couples that choose a procedure to select the gender of their new baby will very often have opinions like these listed below.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Some couples believe if they have lost a child they can choose gender. Choosing a gender that is the same for their new baby won’t replace the one they have lost, but it might help them to work through the loss.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s been suggested that when a parent receives the gender of their choice, they can love the child more, but that is not really relevant to everyone.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This procedure may help in preventing any gender-related diseases of being transmitted to the new baby, which can benefit the child and the parent.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> New parents that plan for balancing their family with fewer children in this economy, might prefer selecting their children as it will be easier to provide them with what they need.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> For a part of the community that doesn’t believe in choosing your child’s gender, it can raise the following points as listed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> They feel it’s not really necessary and very expensive, as well as the fact that it won’t increase the likelihood to fall pregnant.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s not always a hundred percent accurate except when the chosen technique is IVF together with PGD to select the gender, but it’s the option that is most expensive.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Most couples prefer to guess their baby’s gender while pregnant. Thus, by choosing the gender up front, it can eliminate the surprise element. However, a couple that wants a boy and a girl, who after four tries, just have either boys or girls, won’t agree with a guessing game.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Sometimes others might say it may contribute to inequality of gender and cause an imbalance.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2017.

290	110	2	How Can Osseous Surgery Benefit You	Generally, to live a healthy life, your oral health plays an important role. A mouth that is clean is not just necessary for appearance and to eat with comfort, but it also will reduce the risk to develop infection and disease. With any periodontal disease, bacteria within the mouth may easily be carried into different areas of the body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You should consult your dentist for assistance in regards to reclaiming your oral hygiene. Thus, keeping it at a level that is high. It’s important to fill cavities, plus remove any teeth that can’t be repaired. To do so, you also might need treatments like osseous surgery to reach your goal. In order to undergo this specific procedure, it’s necessary to understand what it entitles, as well as the benefits and risks.<br /><br /> About osseous surgery and the reason for doing it<br /><br /> People that suffer from a periodontal disease will be at risk that their teeth, gums, and bone can be destroyed. This disease causes pockets to form around teeth, which is very common and it can spread to other teeth as well. Additionally, it can develop into a breeding ground that increases infections throughout the body. With a mouth that is healthy, gums fit snugly against the teeth to prevent bacteria and food of reaching the area below the gum line.<br /><br /> In the beginning of this condition, it is easier to remove debris from problem areas, but as time goes by, treatment may be difficult, or sometimes even impossible to correct. The dentist will be able to clean the pockets through a reduction surgery for pocket depth’s and prevent further damage along with any infections. It can help you to keep a healthy and cleaner mouth, provided that you maintain good routines of oral health and go for dental cleanings regularly.<br /><br /> The main aim of osseous surgery is to remove all bacteria and debris from your pockets. Gum tissue will be folded back to expose the area around your tooth to clean it. If the tissue of your bone is also damaged, the dentist can smooth it as well. Bacteria can grow and hide even in the smallest of irregularities of your bone. This procedure can allow the tissue of the gum to reattach to the bone that is healthy more effectively.<br /><br /> Afterwards, your dentist can remove some extra tissue of the gum and use tiny stitches to keep your gum in its place to allow for natural healing. Sometimes, they might use a special kind of bandage for dentals.<br /><br /> It’s possible to experience swelling after your surgery, therefore you should apply on the outside an ice pack covering the area that is treated. This will help to reduce any discomfort. Your dentist might also prescribe antibiotics for prior, during, as well as after you have had your treatment.<br /><br /> Some risks factors<br /><br /> The same as any other surgical procedure, osseous surgery can also have risks. Even if you take proper care of your mouth, there might be a chance of infection to develop within the area. Although, by keeping up good oral care and if aftercare is performed properly, it may minimize your risk.<br /><br /> Additionally, gum tissue around your teeth that are treated can recede faster than the rest of the gums. This can cause your treated teeth to look as if they are longer than what the other teeth are. However, when this happens your dentist will be able to treat it.<br /><br /> Different risks might include sensitivities that can increase towards temperatures. It may be necessary to drink beverages that are cold through a straw and to avoid chewing foods that are very hot with your treated teeth. Because these teeth may be at a higher risk for cavities that is root-based, it’s very important to maintain oral care at a level that is high. <br /><br /> Benefits of this surgery<br /><br /> Recovery is easy and fast<br /><br /> Prevent future bacteria buildup<br /><br /> It can smooth a service that is irregular<br /><br /> Damage can be prevented<br /><br /> Attacking all bacteria<br /><br /> Pocket depth can be reduced<br /><br /> Your gums and teeth should fit together snugly in order to protect teeth from every type of infection. Your dentist can provide the necessary treatments for restoring your oral health to what it should be. Always remember, follow up appointments is very important to keep your mouth healthy and ensure that it heals properly.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

291	110	2	And So Our Holiday Truly Starts	My heart starts to race excitedly and the plane starts it's decent. We are here, finally, we are here. It has felt like an eternity before our ocean holiday eventually started.<br /><br /> When my husband and myself got married, we procured some holiday points. It helps a lot as all the places to go to on holiday is sooo expensive.<br /><br /> So, since then we have had a tradition to save up our points for 3 years and then go on one nice long holiday. And here we are again. The ocean is calling, beckoning us to its shores with 3 kids in tow now.<br /><br /> Before our trip, we made a turn at our doctor to ensure the area where we were going was safe. We asked about injections for malaria and other viruses that may be present in the area. Once everything was medically done and safe we were on our way.<br /><br />Renting a car, first things first. <br /><br /> After getting our luggage we all followed Papa bear to the car rental service at the airport. While walking, the kids are having an argument about what color the car should be. Child no 1 wants a Pink car, really, can’t see that one happening, no 2 wants a blue car and no 3, well, she’s just looking at them as if a ball is being passed.<br /><br /> Papa bear winks at me when we get to the front desk of the rental car company, then he puts on an extremely serious face as he continues to ask – “Hi, there, please sir, my daughter wants a pink car, any in stock?”<br /><br /> I feel a giggle rising up at the pit of my stomach but manage to keep a straight face. No 1 is looking with so much expectation at the rental guy that I’m sure his squirming under the intensity of her stare.<br /><br /> To Mr rentals credit, he smiles and very seriously replies – “I am so sorry sir, the last pink chariot has left the building prior to your arrival.” No 1’s face drops with disappointment. Papa bear turns and says “So sorry honey bun, no pink ones. Maybe next time.”<br /><br /> “So, what do you have in blue?” Mr rental guy smiles and starts to tell us all our options. We ended up deciding between 3.<br /><br /> Chrysler town got an immediate no from papa bear. I knew why he’s itching to test drive either the Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape. So, when the Rental guy did not mention either of those in blue, I knew it was coming.<br /><br /> “Do you have either Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape?”<br /><br /> I could see the pent-up excitement on his face. When Mr. Rental guy confirmed that they do in fact have a 2016 Ford Escape in red, I could see papa bear jumping up and down on the inside.<br /><br /> “So kids, what about a red car?” They were easily persuaded and Papa bear was ecstatic. I did not dare touch him due to fear of being shocked. Seriously, if I looked closer, I was sure I could see tiny static running all over his being.<br /><br />Here we go<br /><br /> The bonus of flying is that there is not so much luggage. Thus, the luggage fitted in the Escape without any difficulty.<br /><br /> The nice thing about renting a car is that you get to properly test drive a car, in our case for two weeks. Papa bear was like a little boy as he was cruising down the highway. He was explaining to me about the 1.6L engine that delivers 178hp at 5700rpm. Additionally, the base model is front wheel drive and the one we are currently driving is an all-wheel-drive model. It also features a 15.5-gallon gas tank and delivers a fuel consumption of 22/29mpg.<br /><br /> He was carrying on like a dedicated car salesman. I smiled and made an hmm sound while I smiled and nodded at all the appropriate spaces. I knew this big boy was just like a little boy with a new toy. As they say right, boys and their toys…<br /><br />Meeting the local seagulls<br /><br /> We went to a nice little roadhouse next to the beach for some lunch. We got our order and parked the Escape so that we were overlooking the ocean. We sat outside on the rocks. Such a nice view as the waves broke and the wind gently sprayed us with ocean mist.<br /><br /> No 2 was holding a fry out of the window as he stared across the ocean when suddenly something grabbed the fry out of his hand. He screamed like a little girl! <br /><br /> A seagull took advantage of the hypnotic effect of the ocean and before we knew it we were surrounded by fry-stealing seagulls coming from who knows where.<br /><br /> Suddenly, we knew what it felt like to be surrounded.<br /><br /> The kids freely gave up the last of their fries in fear of seagull stares going mafia on us or being bitten. This, we took as our queue to get moving again.<br /><br />The Escape<br /><br /> The rest of our trip ran smoothly even though we had two nights of extreme mozzy (miskito, the insect kind) attacks, we knew all was fine. Everyone had their injections and no viruses were going to make us ill.<br /><br /> We enjoyed BBQ’s in the sunset overlooking the ocean and playing in the sand. We even got the opportunity to see some crabs and dolphins.<br /><br /> The thing I loved about the Escape, the SUV, is the large back seat, the kids had a ball, with plenty of space for themselves. The front seemed a bit smaller than with other SUV’s I’ve seen but the backseat and the luggage space makes up for it.<br /><br /> Some other small things that also made me like the Escape was the cruise control, backup camera and illuminating vanity mirrors. But the best is the overhead storage compartment, I could really get used to those. I can start to see why Papa Bear had his eye on the Escape. I just wonder does it come in pink?<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br /> The trip was amazing, we loved the Ford Escape and the escape from our busy lives’. The calming effect of the oceans draw refreshed us and we gained new strength to face our lives back home again. We were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br /><br /> How awesome was the fact that we need not drive all those miles back home. We got on an airplane with the refreshing effects of a 2-week ocean holiday still lingering all around us even as we got back home. On top of it all, we were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br />Article last time updated on 12.10.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-10-01 00:00:00	247	m2m
292	110	2	Everything You Should Know About a YAG Capsulotomy Procedure	Yttrium Aluminum Garnet also called YAG, is a procedure that produces infra-red laser light impulses. It is used to create small openings within tissue that are targeted through a process known as photo-disruption. Generally, it’s used for treating the iris and secondary cataracts. Sometimes doctors might also use it in treating problems with the retina at the eye’s back.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Indications<br /><br /> There is a variety of eye conditions treatable with this procedure. Conditions of the eyes that can be treated with a YAG capsulotomy procedure may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    If there are vision interferences with activities during the day.<br /><br /> •    When vision in patients decreases that have multifocal intraocular lenses that might specifically be sensitive to even tiny changes of the posterior capsular.<br /><br /> •    Increased glaring.<br /><br /> •    Difficulty to visualize the fundus.<br /><br /> •    With Z syndrome and lens tilting that is related to hinge compliant lenses, like the Trulign toric and Crystalens lenses. Z syndrome may occur if one hap tic arched posterior and the other anterior, and lens tilting can occur if one hap tic is arched either posterior or anterior and the other is planar.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In some cases, it’s possible for a tiny anterior capsular contraction, capsulorrhexis or capsular phimosis may occur. With such excessive anterior scarring to your intra-ocular lens, it might compromise your vision. Alleviation by anterior radial capsulotomies will be achieved through YAG laser treatment.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> About the procedure<br /><br /> To remove the haze capsule is a minor procedure that only requires dilation of your eye.<br /><br /> The doctor will numb your eye’s front by using special eye drops, after which he/she places a tiny contact lens on the eye. Then your head needs to rest on the YAG laser machine’s frame so that your doctor can focus the laser onto the capsule.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Small holes will be made by this laser into the capsule, in such a pattern which allows the doctor to determine what can be the best treatment for your specific condition.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Because there isn’t any incision required, you won’t feel pain or be at risk to develop infections. However, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drops for your eyes after the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Benefits of YAG capsulotomy procedures<br /><br /> •    The treatment is basically pain-free.<br /><br /> •    There isn’t any risk to get an infection.<br /><br /> •    It’s an outpatient treatment procedure.<br /><br /> •    Less healing time and trauma for your eye.<br /><br /> •    The procedure only lasts for a few minutes, though you might have to stay between one and two hours.<br /><br /> •    Reduced cost.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Recovery after the procedure<br /><br /> After the procedure, you can immediately resume normal activities and expect improvement of your vision within one day. Yet, you might experience some degree of floaters for a couple of weeks following the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> At the completion of the procedure, it’s important after a week to go back for a follow-up so that your doctor can examine the overall results, vision, and pressure. You should only as a precaution each day after your procedure tests your eye sight. Do this by closing your eye which hasn't had the surgery, and checks your eye’s vision.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Every year following the treatment you need to go for a checkup of your eyes. This is done to check for any other problems, as well as glaucoma because if your eye is just slightly unusual, examinations are critical.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Any possible risks to a YAG Capsulotomy procedure<br /><br /> Serious problems are very rare in a posterior YAG capsulotomy because it’s an extremely effective and safe procedure. However, the same as with any type of medical procedure, there might be some degree of risks involved.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The one that is very common may be the pressure that rises within your eye. When this happens the doctor can prescribe some eye drops, or maybe some combination of drops and tablets for reducing this pressure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A risk that might be a bit higher can be the detachment of your retina, as well as swelling of your macula. Nonetheless, both of these risks are quite rare, if your original surgery for cataracts with laser treatment was performed over six months earlier.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> By consulting an experienced professional eye specialist for this procedure, it may minimize your risks significantly involving posterior YAG capsulotomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Once your doctor and you decided that a posterior YAG capsulotomy will be the right choice for you, the doctor can provide you with extra information to allow you in making an informed decision of whether you want to proceed. Make sure that all questions you may have are answered to your full satisfaction.<br />Article last time updated on 24.08.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-08-24 00:00:00	365	m2m
293	110	2	Hysterectomy Types and Complications	What is a Hysterectomy and why is it performed?<br /><br /><br /><br /> A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that consists of removing the uterus. The uterus of a woman may cause pain due to a medical issue. In this case, a doctor or gynecologist can examine the uterus and run some tests to see what the issue is. If it cannot be cured, the uterus may be removed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The most common reasons a woman needs to undergo a hysterectomy procedure are as follow:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Uterine fibroids,<br /><br /> •    Endometriosis,<br /><br /> •    Adenomyosis,<br /><br /> •    Abnormal vaginal bleeding,<br /><br /> •    Chronic pelvic pain,<br /><br /> •    Pelvic inflammatory disease,<br /><br /> •    Cervical dysplasia,<br /><br /> •    Cervical cancer,<br /><br /> •    Uterine cancer,<br /><br /> •    Ovarian cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy types<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Today, there are different surgical techniques used for performing a hysterectomy when needed, such as:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Vaginal hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed through the vagina. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of endometrial hyperplasia, cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Total abdominal hysterectomy – is the most common type of hysterectomy performed among women worldwide. This surgical procedure consists of a total removal of the uterus including the cervix. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of ovary cancer, uterine cancer, large uterine fibroids, endometriosis, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Supracervical hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed but the cervix is spared. A supracervical hysterectomy is recommended in cases when there is no medical indication for removing the cervix. However, later in life, there is always the possibility of cancer development in this part of the cervix that has not been surgically removed at the same time as the uterus.  This type of hysterectomy decreases the risk of vaginal prolapse as it provides some kind of support for the vagina.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopy – assisted vaginal hysterectomy – is a similar surgical procedure to the vaginal hysterectomy, but includes the use of a laparoscope. During this procedure, the upper part of the abdomen is carefully inspected when needed. Such as in cases when the removal of the ovaries is planned as well, or in cases of early stages of endometrial cancer.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy – is similar to laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Though, the difference between these two surgical procedures consists of the fact that in laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy the uterus is separated from the cervix and later removed through a laparoscopic incision. The cervix is preserved in this type of surgery. Thus, the recovery period is faster.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Radical hysterectomy – is an extensive type of surgery usually performed in cases where early stages of cervical cancer are noted. This surgical procedure consists of not only removing the uterus and the cervix but also removing the upper part of the vagina and the surrounding tissues as well. There is a great possibility of a urinary system injury, as well as a bowel injury.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Oophorectomy and scalping - oophorectomy is a surgical procedure which consists of the removal of the ovaries in cases of oophorectomy. In the case of scalping - oophorectomy the adjacent Fallopian tubes are removed as well. These two surgical procedures combined with hysterectomy are performed in cases of ovarian cancer, Fallopian tube cancer, uterine cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy Complications<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Just like any surgical procedure, a hysterectomy has its own risks and possible complications. However, in most of the cases, women do not have any complications at all after this surgical procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> According to different studies, vaginal hysterectomies are linked with fewer risks and complications when compared to abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomies. The more radical the surgical procedure is the greater is the possibility of various risks and complications following hysterectomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Also, the recovery period is shorter in cases of vaginal hysterectomy, when compared to laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomies. Hysterectomy risks and complications greatly depend upon the type of hysterectomy procedure performed, as well as, the overall health of the women undergoing the surgery.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Common risks and complications following a hysterectomy regarding of its type include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Blood clots,<br /><br /> •    Heavy blood loss,<br /><br /> •    Bladder injury,<br /><br /> •    Bowel injury,<br /><br /> •    Infection,<br /><br /> •    Adhesions in the pelvic area,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Weakness of the pelvic muscles and ligaments which normally support the vagina, rectum and the bladder,<br /><br /> •    Difficulties urinating,<br /><br /> •    Early menopause,<br /><br /> •    Anesthesia problems, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Recovering after hysterectomy<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Even though a hysterectomy is a safe surgical procedure, it is often associated with various risks and complications. In general, hospitalization for a couple of days and sometimes weeks following the surgery is required. It only depends on the overall health of the patient and the reason why this procedure is performed in the first place. The recovery period will also depend on the type of hysterectomy performed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In cases of vaginal hysterectomy, the recovery period is faster compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, and even longer for an abdominal hysterectomy. After a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, women should be able to return to their normal daily routines within three to four weeks. In cases of abdominal hysterectomy, the recovery period will take a little bit longer, about four to six weeks.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> However, for a certain period of time after the surgery lifting heavy things, pushing or pulling objects, bending and even sexual intercourse should be avoided.<br />Article last time updated on 23.08.2017.

294	111	2	Should Patients Fire Their Doctors If They Suspect Burnout?	"In my opinion, firing your physician is a risky proposition in light of the looming physician shortage.<br /><br /> Burnout is an overwhelming sense of disillusionment a physician experiences when the practice of medicine holds no joy. It is not a psychological problem, yet can lead to a downward spiral of impairment. According to an article in US News, almost half of physicians have symptoms of burnout. Seven percent of physicians aged 29 to 65 contemplated suicide in the last year. These statistics are troubling on many levels.<br /><br /> Over half of current physicians state, if given the opportunity to choose again, they would not choose medicine as a career. Why? Our once noble profession has lost its magnificence in an explosion of technology, nonsensical regulations, and increased clerical burden. According to a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, for every one hour of patient contact, a physician spends two hours doing administrative work. Never-Had-a-Bad-Day-Noseworthy said, “EHR’s are not easy to use.”  Why are physicians being required [forced] to utilize useless technology if it does not reduce burnout while improving efficiency and care quality?<br /><br /> Look, we sacrificed our youth seeking delayed gratification that may never come; physicians have responsibility, but no authority, and vast quantities of knowledge, yet no autonomy. Sadly, we have ceded it to arrogant administrators running amok in a system of unfettered capitalism. Regrettably, this oppression has taken a toll on us all, patients included.<br /><br /> How did physician burnout become linked to increased medical errors? A study examined the relationship between the burnout experienced by surgeons and frequency of medical errors. The more exhausted and depersonalized your physician has become the greater your likelihood of experiencing a medical error.<br /><br /> How common are these so-called medical errors? Last May, the British Medical Journal released a study ranking medical errors as the third leading cause of death in the U.S., after heart disease and cancer, killing 250,000 people a year. From my perspective, an overwhelming workload also plays a significant role. A recent study in JAMA found increasing a nurses’ workload from four to six patients increases the death rate by 14 percent, while going from six to eight patients is tied to a 31 percent increase in death rate. The wheel is turning, but the hamster is dead, literally.<br /><br /> If a physician is suffering from burnout, let us walk through the conversation Dr. Noseworthy is so naively proposing.<br /><br /> Patient: “Doc, You are not as empathetic as you used to be.  I am thinking about changing physicians?”<br /><br /> Physician: “Well, what exactly is the problem?""<br /><br /> Patient: “Well you used to spend more time with me at appointments and seemed to care.”<br /><br /> Physician: “I wish there was more time to talk. I sure loved my job back then …”  (Sigh. Continual tapping of computer keys heard in the background while trying to seem empathetic.)<br /><br /> Valuing the physician-patient relationship allows it to be a central transformative therapeutic force. Obamacare expanded coverage for almost 20 million Americans seemingly overnight. Patient volumes doubled due to the unprecedented surge in insurance coverage? There were not enough physicians in reserve to care for the overwhelming onslaught especially in underserved rural areas; most of us on the front lines are drowning in paperwork, administrative and regulatory burdens. Being a physician under current circumstances is like trying to get a sip of water out of a fire hose. Every physician in this country is on the train barreling toward burnout.<br /><br /> Last week, I referred four different patients to four different local pediatric specialists. Three of those four physicians called to let me know they are retiring at the end of the year. With all due respect to Dr. Noseworthy, at the rate things are going, firing your physician will land a patient in medical limbo until they can find a physician desperate enough to accept them. This man is so out of touch with reality outside the ivory tower, he is completely oblivious to the larger implications of the looming physician shortage.<br /><br /> According to the Association of American Medical Colleges report, the projected shortage will reach 85,000 physicians by 2020. In “Will the Last Physician in America Please Turn Off the Lights,” three co-authors from Merritt, Hawkins & Associates say the wait to see a physician will jump to three to four months for a non-emergent visits, and it will cost two to three times what it does now–whether you are insured or not. Guess what? I am already at the three-month mark for non-emergent appointments and struggling to keep up with the growing patient demand.<br /><br /> Physicians are resilient to a fault, coupled with stoic demeanors, inquisitive minds, and strongly empathetic natures, but we all have our limits. Reducing burnout will only be feasible when we have more independence over the particulars of our self-sacrificing occupation. If every physician in this country insisted on caring for patients as we saw fit and refused to click even one more box, a revolution would ensue. We must stop “rolling over” when asked to do more with fewer resources, reduced pay, and even less time. Physicians must put on their own oxygen masks before helping others with theirs.<br /><br /> Despite his insulting recommendation, Dr. Noseworthy might actually be on our side. “Physicians are highly dedicated professionals, who are good people, but have been crushed [by the system.]”  Do not allow yourself to be destroyed by a system we cannot control.  Take back medicine for yourself and your patients. Know your value. Do not bend to the demands of managers and administrators; refuse to accept a workload that prohibits attaining occupational jubilation and enlightenment.<br /><br /> There is an impending crisis no one has foreseen; the winds are about to shift in our direction. Rules of supply and demand are universal. Soon, it will be a “physicians market”; we will cherry pick patients based on their having good insurance, a healthy medical profile, and a pleasant demeanor.<br /><br /> Let us circle back to Dr. Noseworthy, “Change physicians. It is too risky to be cared for by someone who is impaired.” You know what is more risky than that? It is having no physician at all when you desperately need one. My advice is to build a relationship with a physician while you still can. If your physician is not empathetic or appears to be suffering from burnout, my cautionary recommendation is to be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Link to PBS interview: http://www.pbs.org/video/chicago-tonight-head-mayo-clinic-epidemic-burnout-among-doctors/<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Maja Dumat/flickr/CC-BY <br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017."

295	111	2	Do Physicians Deserve Our Mercy?	The frustrated physician replies, “Then fine … Get the hell out. Get your money and get the hell out.” While we do not witness events leading up to the argument between doctor and patient, we do know the staff at the front desk called the police due to threats made by the patient to others.<br /><br /><br />  Based on the statement released by Peter Gallogly, MD, he is a humble, thoughtful, and compassionate physician who was very concerned for the safety of his staff, which he considers “family.” Physicians like Dr. Gallogly do their best to serve patients, ease their suffering, and avoid losing ourselves to burnout at the same time. Every human being deserves our compassion, kindness, and clemency.  Patients and physicians must accommodate each other when possible.<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Do physicians actually deserve our mercy when necessary? Yes, they do. I should know. The kindness shown to me by my patients over the past month has been unparalleled, leaving this physician thankful beyond words.<br /><br /><br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> My father has been a practicing pediatrician in our community for 47 years. As I type these words, he is dying in a hospital bed. We have worked side by side for the last 16 years. It is difficult to make it through the day, desperately hoping to hear his voice one last time in the clinic hallway. He was carrying a full patient load before an unexpected cardiac arrest ended his career. The patient load doubled overnight; it is a burden I am carrying alone.<br /><br /><br />  Many families have brought their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to us for more than 40 years. We have seen them through the darkest moments of their lives, at their most vulnerable, and brought them into the light. Now, our patients must guide me through unimaginable heartache and grief.<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Long wait times can be terribly frustrating. Punctuality has long been a personal obsession. Lately, I have been unable to keep up; patients with appointments are waiting more than two hours to be seen. Every new encounter begins with an apology for tardiness followed by an update on the condition of my father. Most families are aware of my overwhelming task — running a practice built for two when I am but one physician. Not a single parent or child has complained, yelled, accosted, or threatened. Each family has shown me desperately needed mercy.<br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> Over the last twenty-one days, patients have provided 15 home-cooked meals.  Some have assisted by car-pooling my children or taking care of them when my presence at a last minute hospital care coordination meeting was required. Others have simply offered a helping hand, by filing charts, running errands, or landscaping the grounds. This is the physician-patient relationship as it was meant to be, simple, beautiful, and perfect.<br /><br /><br />  Yesterday, after apologizing yet again, a mother reassured me she would wait as long as it took to have her child seen, hugged me tightly, told me to take a deep breath, and offered me her chair to rest. She reminded me to take care of myself. In the next room was a grandmother who has been patronizing our practice since 1977, when I was barely three years old. She offered billing services free of charge and emphasized how grateful she was for the loving care provided for two generations to her family. The clinic my father established is a place where mutual admiration between physician and patient has existed seamlessly for a half century.  Magic happens when patients walk through our doors. The next time your physician is running late, consider the challenges they might have faced that day. Accommodating their delay will be treasured more than you can possibly imagine.<br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> Medicine is not a hospitality industry. Patients are not customers and physicians are not restaurant wait staff. We gave up our youth to become educated, skilled, and compassionate. Saving the life of human beings is not equivalent to ordering a hamburger and having it served your way. Physicians genuinely work hard to serve patients at their most desperate hour. Remember, we are also human beings, who unequivocally need and deserve your mercy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> *Video Reference: http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/gone-viral/os-gainesville-doctor-patient-argument-20171012-story.html<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />maxmann/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 14.11.2017.

296	111	2	The Unexpected Impact This Patient Had On His Pediatrician	I never call them names, insult them, or label them. On the contrary, I have high expectations and am always encouraging them to be their best selves. I often hug them tight as their anger gives way to tears, reassuring them as much as possible.<br /><br /> A decade ago, I took care of a blended family with three children by three different fathers. The oldest boy, Bobby (identifying information changed), was an “angry” seven year old with wide eyes and an endearing, crooked smile. His mother was exasperated and demanded tranquilizers be prescribed to him, or she would switch physicians. I asked Bobby what was going on. He talked about conflicts with his mothers’ new boyfriend and how he resented this man calling him lazy and stupid. He had tears in his eyes, which broke my heart.<br /><br /> I talked to him about ways to deal with his anger and recommended a nearby family counselor. I hugged him, acknowledged his frustration, and told him he was neither lazy nor stupid. I reminded him to never give up on himself, and no matter what happened, I would always believe in him. Needless to say, his mom changed physicians, and I did not see Bobby again.<br /><br /> When children enter the juvenile detention system, they lose Medicaid insurance coverage. As a result, I was the consulting physician at our local juvenile facility. I cared for children who were addicts, thieves, vandals, and committed a variety of other crimes. I reviewed their health history, updated immunizations, and prescribed medications when necessary. It was difficult to reconcile my job as a physician looking into their eyes and seeing their fear, yet knowing I could do nothing to alleviate the obstacles they faced.<br /><br /> My toughest day was the one when I unexpectedly ran into Bobby. I had been consulting over the phone with the RN at juvenile hall on a teenager who sustained injuries during arrest by coordinating care with a local specialist. Over the five day time period, I never asked his name.<br /><br /> Each week, I drove to juvenile hall to sign orders and examine children when necessary. That day, I came upon Bobby’s chart.<br /><br /> “This is my injured boy? I know him.” I declared. She smiled and replied, “He said you were his doctor when he was little, and he is excited to see you.”<br /><br /> As the guard left to get Bobby, I told him, “Be prepared. I am going to hug this next one like he is my own son. I do not care what he did.”<br /><br /><br />  The guard gave me a funny look as he sauntered away. I had thought of Bobby so often over the years, yet had the sinking feeling things had been far from rosy. As Bobby walked through the metal double doors, I was struck by how much he had changed in both size and stature (now well over 6 feet tall). We hugged as if no time had passed: “Bobby, you are so much more grown up than I remember.” He smiled with that same crooked grin I found so endearing a decade before. “You are so much tinier than I remember,” he replied looking down at me.<br /><br /><br /> Over the last decade, his mother and her children moved multiple times, had done their fair share of couch surfing, and Bobby had been suspended for misbehavior and truancy. A few months before his arrest, his mother kicked him out, he moved back to the area, was stealing, using drugs, and suspected his 17-year-old girlfriend was newly pregnant.<br /><br /> Crestfallen, I almost started crying, then and there. My dreams for this young boy from ten years ago were shattered into tiny little pieces. In my mind, at the tender age of seven, he had been a ball of clay ready to be molded into something beautiful. Instead, all hope had been extinguished from the young man who stood before me now. There was no sparkle in his eye; the devilish grin was all that remained of that innocent child I once knew.<br /><br /> Honest to a fault, we talked about lost opportunities and lasting consequences of his poor decisions. I encouraged him to dream of a future outside of prison walls. I reminded him of how kind, warm, and genuine he was with a great deal to offer the world.<br /><br /> Unprepared for my own feelings of sadness and disappointment, this experience hit me unexpectedly like a ton of bricks. I have yet to recover the abiding faith that all children can achieve their dreams. It has been an extremely tough lesson to accept; yet it reaffirmed my commitment to continue encouraging, loving, and supporting each and every child who walks through my doors and into my heart.<br /><br /> While I do not know where Bobby is today, I hope our brief encounter had as profound an impact on him, and he did on me. Kiddo, I think of you every day and hope you are safe, know you are loved, and remember you have much to offer the world.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />ArtsyBee/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 18.07.2017.

297	111	2	Is Direct Primary Care Doomed To Fail?	A recent Medical Economics article asked “Is the DPC model at risk of failing?”<br /><br /> The piece focuses on two large DPC-like organizations, Qliance Medical Management of Seattle, Washington and Turntable Health of Las Vegas, NV, working in partnership with Iora Health, which recently closed their doors. Qliance and Turntable were not actually DPC practices by strict definition; they were innovative large business operations providing health care services to patients and excluding third party payers. Their idea was commendable, but their closure indicates little cause for concern in regard to the growing direct primary care movement.<br /><br /> Robert Berenson, MD, who admits to not being a fan of the DPC model, said “Qliance has been the poster child for DPC … If that one can’t make it … it suggests the business model (of DPC) is flawed.” He is correct about one thing: The “business” model of medicine is certainly flawed.<br /><br /> What Dr. Berenson fails to realize is that DPC is not a “business” model; it is a “care” model. Whether accepting insurance or DPC in structure, we already know solo, and two-physician practices deliver the best care and have been doing so for the past 100 years. These intimate clinics know their customers better than anyone else in the industry, and can devote the time necessary to their clientele; these micro-practices should be known as the small giants of health care.<br /><br /> Strictly defined, direct primary care is a practice model centered on an arrangement wherein a patient and physician enter into a contract to provide unlimited primary care services for an affordable monthly fee (less than $100 per month.) 80% of health care needs can be met in a DPC practice. The typical DPC practice has 1 or 2 physicians, 600 patients maximum per physician, and on average each physician sees ten patients per day. Employees are minimal, usually including a receptionist and/or a medical assistant. Only minimal office space is required to run such a lean operation, so overhead remains low. Supplies, medication, and equipment are purchased on an as-needed basis and used only when necessary.<br /><br /> Qliance, founded in 2007 by Dr. Garrison Bliss and Dr. Erika Bliss, charged $64 per month for adult members and $44 per month for children. They had 13,000 patients in total including primary care and emergency care services, more than 20 times the number of patients compared to a traditional DPC clinic. They were trying to use a model embraced by direct primary care practices yet scale it into something entirely different. After ten years, the experiment failed.<br /><br /> Iora Health, vying to become the “Starbucks” of health care, was in partnership with Turntable Health utilizing a “team-based” concept. Each “team” included a physician, nurse, and a health coach. This model contracted with individuals, but also employers and unions already paying for health care by offering improved access to primary care services and pocketing a portion of the savings that materialized. In this model, physicians usually had 1,000 patients and each health coach with a few hundred. Turntable charged $80 per month for adults and $60 per month for children to have access to their vision of a “wellness ecosystem,” which included yoga, meditation, and cooking classes.<br /><br /> An article in the New York Times quoted Duncan Reece, the VP of Business at Iora Health, “We wanted to do something radically different and show this isn’t your grandfathers’ doctor’s office.”<br /><br /> I get it. This is the kind of things that VPs of business say.<br /><br /> Let’s walk it back. Can someone please tell me what was wrong with that model? It was a quintessential small giant of the business world. My grandfather was an outstanding general practice physician with a small office and one nurse on staff. He made house calls. He did appendectomies, tonsillectomies, C-sections, vasectomies, and met most of his patients’ basic primary health care needs for 40 years. Why do we need something radically different?<br /><br /> The bottom line is health care requires two participants.<br /><br /> One physician and one patient. While it is a nice idea, we do not need yoga, massage, or smoothie bars in our clinics to improve patient outcomes. Adequate medical knowledge and time for meaningful conversations is essential; something the small giants of health care are experienced in providing. The vision of a “wellness ecosystem” should probably go the way of the “patient-centered medical home,” as there is little cost savings or difference in outcomes compared to the traditional fee-for-service system.<br /><br /> So what qualities make the best practices? According to a study conducted by The Peterson Center on Healthcare at Stanford, the very best primary care practices have either one location or a small handful of them. Stanford compiled a list of 10 distinguishing features of these top practices, and many are commensurate with being a “small giant” of the business world. My favorite characteristic on the list is to invest in people, not space or equipment. By lowering overhead, physicians are not relying on patient volume to generate adequate income. These practices are consciously choosing to stay small by renting minimal space and investing in added services only when believing them to be more cost-effective.<br /><br /> The government and insurance companies cannot fix health care. It is up to physicians and patients– one micro-practice or DPC clinic at a time. Dr. Kimberly Legg Corba, owner of Green Hills Direct Family Care, said “The DPC model is growing and practices are converting all the time. Some are opening by transitioning an established practice, some are physicians starting clinics fresh out of residency from scratch, and others are leaving employed positions to return to practicing medicine in a way they love.”<br /><br /> While my practice is not DPC, it is a small, old-fashioned clinic serving families for as long as three generations. Our records are still on paper, a real human being answers the phone when it rings, and for occasional emergencies, patients stop by my house for a “reverse house call.” My belief in the DPC model is steadfast because any “care” model placing control directly into the hands of physicians and their patients is worth fighting to preserve and protect. The more small giants able to thrive in the constantly evolving health care landscape, the greater chance physicians have of inciting a large scale revolution to benefit patients everywhere.<br /><br /> Since the Affordable Care Act legislation went into effect, mergers and consolidations have increased by 70%, at the expense of care becoming less personalized and increasingly fragmented.   These large institutions are profit centers for CEOs and business executives who have very little knowledge of what goes on between a physician and a patient. They need the independent practice model to fail so patient choice is no longer an option.<br /><br /> The small giants, micro-practices and DPC clinics, will continue to prosper and grow because a “care” model devoted to preservation of the physician-patient relationship cannot be defeated. Physicians must stop being afraid to take that leap of faith, leave employment, and go back to doing what we love most, caring for our patients and improving their lives. Physicians should be standing at the bedside, not in front of computer workstations. Direct Primary Care is a model for which we should all be rooting; it is transforming the physician-patient relationship and restoring the practice of medicine to its noble roots, allowing for the art, the science, and the wholly fulfilled physician.<br /><br /> My advice for patients everywhere: Whenever possible, find an independent practice, whether a solo doctor or direct primary care clinic, and patronize that physician. Your care will be more personalized, cost less in the long run, and your health will be better for the investment you made in yourself.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />javallma/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 04.07.2017.

298	111	2	What Are The Barriers To Healthcare?	What Are the Barriers To Healthcare?<br /><br /> Prior to her death, a courageous young woman named Jess Jacobs, who suffered from POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), wrote a somewhat horrifying account of hospitalization in Washington D.C. Her goal was to work toward meaningful healthcare changes in the system for the better. When I came across the story of another young woman afflicted with this disease, it sparked my interest. She has given me permission to share one of her many experiences with barriers of her own.    <br /><br /> Katelyn Anderson has EDS and was “officially” diagnosed with POTS five years ago.  She holds a B.S. in Communications and was starting her graduate studies when one morning she woke with a racing heart, dizziness, and blackened vision. Physicians informed her there is no cure and she must resign herself to feeling exhausted and nauseous for the rest of her life. Despite this, she has continued searching for methods to ameliorate her disease symptoms, which can include hypotension, poor circulation, headache, fatigue, tachycardia, nausea, shortness of breath, and unpredictable syncopal events. Doctors have compared her quality of life to that of a patient on dialysis and her level of fatigue to a person with congestive heart failure. <br /><br /> This remarkable woman is just 28 years old. Katelyn receives routine infusions of saline and nausea medications through a port in her chest so she can stand without near syncope. Her port is her life line. An in-home caregiver assists her with activities of daily living such as meal preparation, grocery shopping, and bathing. <br /><br /> Determined to make a difference, Katelyn has been using her talent as a photographer and blogger to inform and educate others about P.O.T.S. Most recently, Governor Jay Inslee and Mayor Patty Lent proclaimed October as Dysautonomia Awareness Month for Washington State and the City of Bremerton. <br /><br /> Katelyn moved to Kitsap County three years ago, yet has been unable to transfer her care locally due to lack of access. She travels back to Spokane, WA for care from a variety of specialists. Katelyn has been forced not only to coordinate her care, but navigate a world in which she is unfamiliar. “I do not want people to be at a place in their life where they have to take healthcare into their own hands”, she declared.<br /><br /> Katelyn is right. Our healthcare system is a disjointed assortment of people, processes, and centers lacking vital interoperability. For Katelyn, POTS is likely secondary to having EDS. Definitive diagnosis requires eliminating other causes, such as Addison’s Disease, where the adrenal glands are unable to produce enough cortisol. Cortisol is important for immune function, blood sugar regulation, blood pressure stabilization, and metabolism. In high stress situations, we need increased cortisol release to function optimally. <br /><br /> If supply cannot meet demand, fatigue, low blood pressure and dizziness result even progressing to loss of consciousness. The gold standard for diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency is an ACTH stimulation test. A baseline cortisol level is drawn, ACTH is administered, and then cortisol levels are checked 30 and 60 minutes later. <br /><br /> Below is a timeline of the illogical road blocks Katelyn had to navigate to schedule her test.<br /><br /> 5/10: An endocrinologist in Spokane recommends the ACTH stimulation test.<br /><br /> 5/12: Katelyn calls the local infusion clinic for appointment. The referral has not been received.<br /><br /> Late July: The test is authorized by insurance and scheduled for September. Three medications must be discontinued for the test to be accurate meaning Katelyn is resigned to<br /><br /> 9/12:  Katelyn is denied her lab test when she arrives at the infusion clinic<br /><br /> 9/12: By afternoon, the only option was finding a local PCP to write an order. This was difficult as ACTH stimulation tests are typically ordered, administered, and interpreted by specialists.<br /><br /> 9/13-15:  Katelyn calls her three clinic options in our county. None are accepting new Medicaid patients or are uncomfortable accepting her due to medical complexity. This is a common problem in our geographically isolated area. <br /><br /> 9/16: Katelyn’s sister convinces her physician, to accept Katelyn. <br /><br /> 9/22: Katelyn hand delivers it to the infusion clinic requesting it be given to the nurse manager. <br /><br /> 9/29:  Katelyn calls to make appointment at infusion clinic. The order was lost.  A request for second order from her physician was made by fax. The infusion clinic would not schedule appointment since they did not have an order. <br /><br /> 9/30:  Katelyn called infusion clinic, the second order has still not been received. The Nurse Manager is in a meeting. <br /><br /> 10/5:  Katelyn returns to the infusion clinic. They have not received a fax with the second order. <br /><br /> 10/7:  Katelyn calls the infusion clinic. The order has still not been received. She calls her physician. By afternoon, no response and the day ends with no order and no plan.  <br /><br /> 10/10: Katelyn calls in the morning and in the afternoon, no progress is made. <br /><br /> 10/11: Katelyn’s mother (ARNP from out of town) goes with her to the infusion clinic. No order. The front staff offers little help to make progress. The Nurse Manager is available after Katelyn’s third request. Nurse Manager facilitates the order from physician’s office and test is scheduled for 10/12 at 830am.<br /><br /> Accomplishing this task took more than 5 months. Medical care should be more accessible, equitable, and favorable for people like Katelyn. We must fix our broken system and eliminate arbitrary barriers for patients and physicians. Katelyn and countless others suffering from chronic disease deserve our time, effort, and above all, the best quality patient care. <br /><br /> Katelyn is an inspiration, she strives to see the beauty in life's ordinary moments and capture them with her lens.

299	111	2	My Relationships With Patients Last Generations	I will be honest; I panicked a little. My husband was home asleep as were my four children. My thoughts as I raced up two flights of stairs to reach the phone were, “Could they be injured or in trouble?”<br /><br /> A young woman was crying and saying her mom was asking for me. I still could not figure out who was on the phone. Who knew I was here, at this time of the morning?<br /><br /> “It’s Mary’s daughter.”<br /><br /> I was still trying to piece this together in my brain. Mary’s son was very sick, in a hospital, out of state. Her mother kept saying I was the only one who could help.<br /><br /> Mary had been a co-worker of mine when I was a medical student 20 years ago.  She worked at our local health department where I conducted a study evaluating the benefit of home visiting services for children. I had spent the summer of 1996 accompanying her on visits to homes in some of the most impoverished parts of my hometown. More than a decade later, the program was cut due to lack of funding; I jumped at the chance to have her work at my office.  She had since returned to home visiting work in our community.<br /><br /> On the phone, Mary was sobbing to the point I could not understand her. Her husband got on the phone and said their son, was very ill and lying in an ICU with kidney failure. Their daughter-in-law had contacted them but could not relay the exact details of his illness.<br /><br /> “Please call the hospital and help us find out more, so we know what to do.”<br /><br /> I doubted I could help them; I did not think the hospital would even talk to me, but told them I would do my best.<br /><br /> I thought about their son’s chart in my office. I had shredded it two weeks before; it had been more than a decade since I had last seen him and he was in his thirties now.  I take care of his son, Mary’s grandson, who is a young teenager. I thought about what this loss would mean for my young patient as I dialed the number and asked to speak with the ICU nurse. She came to the phone. I explained that I had been her patient’s primary care physician many years ago and a family friend for two decades; I inquired as to his clinical status so I could inform the family. She told me he was critically ill; they were doing everything they could to keep him alive.  She was not sure he was going to make it the next few hours, let alone days.<br /><br /> I let her know I would relay the information to his parents and recommend they get on a plane.<br /><br /> “I am not sure they should be told he could die at any moment,” she replied.<br /><br /> I conveyed there was no one else better to relay that kind of message. She wished me luck. As I dialed Mary’s number, my thoughts turned to my own brother who had died in an accident eight years before. I remember that phone call like it was yesterday and the crushing pain that followed when I was told the tragic news. I had watched my own parents lose their son. I knew what this family may experience today, tomorrow, or next week.<br /><br /> This was different; their son was alive, and they still had a chance to see him. Mary answered the phone.<br /><br /> “Your son is critically ill and may die today. I am so very sorry. The best thing I can tell you at this moment is to get on the first plane available and go see him. I hope you have a chance to say goodbye, if that is what is to happen.”<br /><br /> They thanked me. I was crying as I hung up the phone still sitting in the dark parking lot outside the tennis club.<br /><br /> Their son made it through and had a long road to recovery. Hippocrates said, “Cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always.” As a small-town pediatrician, I understand these words better than ever before. Our job as physicians is not always to diagnose, treat, and cure. It is also to ease the suffering of others and comfort them whenever we can.<br /><br /> The relationships with families continue long after their children are grown up and become parents themselves. More than a dozen parents in my practice were my patients as children, and now their children are my patients as well. Our role in the lives of the human beings for whom we have lovingly cared is a wonderful blessing, but also a grind on my heart. It is a relationship I treasure.<br /><br />The names and circumstances have been changed to protect patient privacy.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Muisje/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 23.05.2017.

300	111	2	You’ve Heard Of Brexit? Here’s What They Call Doctors Who Are Leaving.	Once DRexit begins, there will be no turning back.<br /><br /> The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) is destructive to the physician-patient relationship because it prevents physicians from prioritizing patient care. MACRA supporters like to point out this legislation was passed with bipartisan support; in reality, it was passed simultaneously with the repeal of the sustainable growth rate formula.<br /><br /> The sustainable growth rate formula was enacted through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and was designed by lawmakers to control Medicare expenditures. The SGR formula limited the annual increase in cost per Medicare beneficiary to the growth of the national economy. Under the SGR formula, if overall physician costs exceeded target expenditures, a reduction in payments would be triggered. Expenditures continued to climb, so Congress stepped in 17 times with short-term legislation (referred to as “doc fix”) to avert the payment reduction since 2002.<br /><br /> These patches kept increases in physician payments below inflation which ultimately resulted in a huge discrepancy between the actual level of Medicare physician-related spending and the target in the SGR formula. In 2015, if Congress did not act by March 31, payments to Medicare physicians would have been reduced by 21.2 percent.<br /><br /> Enter stage left, MACRA, known as the “permanent doc fix,” which was passed concurrently with the sustainable growth rate formula repeal legislation. This was the original “repeal and replace.” MACRA established yet another new (and untested) method by which to pay doctors. MACRA is the largest scale reform on the American health care system since the Affordable Care Act in 2010, and the jury is still out how great (or not) that system is working for the American people.<br /><br /> Under MACRA, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services was tasked with implementation of a Merit-Based Incentive (MIP) program which consolidated three useless incentive programs into one big colossal unworkable program for eligible physicians everywhere. The legislation also allows for Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APM), which shockingly, are not actually saving money on care.<br /><br /> Even better, MACRA related regulations also addressed incentives for use of health IT by physicians and other care providers. Similar in scope to the meaningful use (a.k.a meaningless abuse) program except, now on steroids. The Government Accountability Office in partnership with the DHHS has been assisting with the implementation of electronic health records (EHR) nationwide, while at the same time comparing and selecting programs for providers.<br /><br /> So to recap, Congress has been working on a “doc fix” system in conjunction with every lobby possible on the planet except that of practicing physicians since 1997. They “repealed and replaced” SGR (first disaster) with the atrocity known as MACRA, which will end in a mass DRexit. They are rapidly moving ahead with non-evidence based payment methods intended to decrease costs, yet are highly unlikely to be successful based on recent studies. On top of all that, they are selecting computer systems for physicians which incentivize computer data entry while discouraging the placement of hands on patients. Did I miss anything?<br /><br /> Recent studies show physicians spend twice as much time on technology than we do with patients. Maybe with full MACRA implementation, we can be retrained as data entry clerks to treat conditions instead of people. Imagine if we just called in prescriptions for hypertension, diabetes or even started chemotherapy regimens without seeing patients at all? MACRA pays us more for “doing less,” so now we can practice “drive-by medicine.” I wonder if health outcomes will improve and mortality will be lower when compared with “drive-by shootings.”<br /><br /> Controlling costs involves four major pillars of change to our health care system, about which I have been writing for some time. Listening to a talk given recently by the executive director for the Association of Independent Doctors, Marni Jameson, helped focus the strategy. The first cost control pillar is to educate patients and lawmakers as to how consolidations of hospitals and medical practices raise costs, reduce quality, decrease access, eliminate jobs and result in unnecessary testing and procedures. The second pillar is to increase price transparency, so consumers can compare costs and choose the most affordable option. The third pillar is eliminating the onerous “facility fee” to bring payments of hospital-employed doctors in line with the lower payments to independent doctors for the same care. The final pillar is ensuring hospital profits are taxed equally across-the-board, regardless of whether they are non-profit or for-profit institutions.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Shannon Clark/flickr/CC BY-SA <br />Article last time updated on 16.05.2017.

301	111	2	The Story Of A Rare, Serious Complication Of Mononucleosis	She brought him to my clinic the following day. He looked mildly ill. His vitals were stable; he was fatigued, slightly dehydrated, and pale. His tonsils were enlarged to the point they were “kissing,” though not causing airway obstruction. I gave him a steroid injection, with strict orders to go home, rest, drink clear liquids, and return with his mother the next morning.<br /><br /> On the second day, he walked in looking unequivocally worse. He was complaining of neck pain, though not stiffness, and his tonsils were considerably more swollen. I drew blood, sent it off, and recommended a lateral neck film to evaluate his airway.  The lab called within the hour for an unusual finding. He had atypical lymphocytes (mono cells) and a few schistocytes (chewed up cells) on his smear, he had thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and his sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation) was unexpectedly low, something I had not encountered before. I pulled out the book to search for causes of low ESR, and a particular one jumped out. The test can be a marker for fibrinogen levels, which if abnormal, may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a serious complication of infection. I spoke with the lab and added a PT, PTT, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels (tests to help with diagnosis.)<br /><br /> The radiologist called to say my patient’s airway was narrowed and as I was contemplating my next step, he and his mother returned. I will never forget the look of fear in his mothers’ eyes as he assumed a “tripod” position with labored breathing in my waiting room. I am certain distress was etched on my face as well. I called an ambulance to take him to the nearest hospital. His mother started sobbing, and I held her hand while we waited for EMS to arrive. I promised her he was going to be alright, not being certain whether or not that was the truth. Once on his way in the ambulance, I breathed a sigh of relief.<br /><br /> The term glandular fever was first used in 1889 by German physicians who recognized a clinical syndrome with the classic triad of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. “The kissing disease” is transmitted via primarily oropharyngeal secretions. 50 percent of children are infected before age 5; approximately 12 percent of susceptible college-aged young adults seroconvert each year, some of whom experience severe complications.<br /><br /> Patients with infectious mononucleosis present clinically with fatigue, which may be profound, but usually, resolves over three months. Nausea, without vomiting, weight loss, and anorexia are common. Mortality and morbidity due to uncomplicated EBV infectious mononucleosis infections are low. There is really no treatment for this condition except rest, hydration, and the tincture of time. However, massive tonsillar enlargement may result in airway obstruction, for which steroids are indicated, which was present in this particular case. Rarely, mononucleosis results in more severe complications, such as encephalitis, pancreatitis, myocarditis, and myositis.<br /><br /> While I see mononucleosis often, I have not seen a case of DIC in the last 13 years.  He was admitted to the ICU that evening and remained there for three days on steroids and antibiotics. D-dimers came back positive, and the rest of his labs were consistent with DIC. He decided to take some time off from school to recover and was able to make up the finals he missed during the next semester. Over the years, he moved on to his adult life elsewhere, and we lost touch.<br /><br /><br />  About twice a year, patients from the past stop by for a “social call” while passing through town. Visitors are always an unexpected blessing to my day. I remember every single one by name, even after almost two decades in practice. This visitor was the young man’s brother, who is just as special to me. I hugged him, and he handed me an envelope from his mother. His older brother turned 31 recently and is doing well. I opened the card to find these handwritten words:<br /><br />   <br /><br />  “Not a year goes by without conversations about you, and much gratitude for truly saving my son’s life when he had mononucleosis in 2003.  We have had our challenges, but all in all doing very well.”<br /><br />   <br /><br /><br /> “Every year at the beginning of December, we give extra thanks for you, your heart, your caring, and expertise. Your efforts on our son’s behalf continue to be perhaps the greatest blessing we have experienced. We hope it has been returned to you ten-fold! With much love …”<br /><br /><br />  I often wonder who has been the greatest blessing to whom. A physician bears witness to the direct impact we have on the lives of other human beings. What a rare treasure to behold! As physicians, our journey is riddled with successes and failures.<br />  Yet, my love and dedication to this noble and rewarding profession is instantaneously revitalized when a young person wanders into my office and reminds me of a time when we overcame such insurmountable odds together.<br /><br /><br />  <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />David Goehring/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 25.04.2017.

302	111	2	A Child’s Father Knew When To Let Go. The Health Care Team Didn’t.	During the first ICU rotation in my second year of pediatric residency, we arrived at the bedside of an 8-year-old girl, who looked like any other kid her age. Rose had long dark hair, green eyes, and freckles. I have always loved children with freckles. Maybe they remind me of her. Rose was diagnosed by chest x-ray with an “anterior mediastinal mass” and was being temporarily transferred to a different hospital for radiation treatment. She would return to our care in the afternoon. When the other second-year resident got to the “plan” of his presentation, the cardiothoracic surgeon interrupted and said this was a “ticking time bomb.”  I did not understand what he meant until later that evening.<br /><br /> The surgeon continued, explaining if she had difficulty breathing we were to run a full code. Manage her airway, intubate her if necessary, and if that was not working, cut open her chest to pull the mass up off her heart and lungs until he could arrive and perform surgery. The plan seemed oddly pessimistic in light of the fact Rose was sitting up and breathing comfortably while we were standing outside her room having this conversation. Our attending physicians seemed skittish; they kept repeating we should be ready for anything.<br /><br /> Curious about Rose’s illness, I spent some time after rounds reviewing her chart. She had been coughing for six weeks and complained of shortness of breath when lying down. Her primary care physician prescribed a few courses of steroid medication over that time period, and she would improve after each round. A few days off of steroids, she would worsen, so her physician ordered a chest x-ray which revealed the tumor.<br /><br /> Rose returned from radiation treatment, and we followed her labs closely. The ICU fellow kept saying it was odd there were no changes in electrolytes or evidence the radiation had its intended effect. We checked on her before heading down to dinner. She looked fine, was sitting up in bed and smiling. Just as we sat down to eat; our emergency pagers went off. We ran up three flights of stairs and arrived at her bedside in a minute or two. I will never forget the expression on her face; it was fright, dread, and panic all rolled into one. She took one heaving breath, laid back, and was gone. She was not breathing and had no pulse. It was in an instant. I straddled her on the bed and began chest compressions. The respiratory therapist was managing her airway with a bag to provide oxygen. The fellow began to set up for intubation.<br /><br /> It happened so fast, I did not notice anyone else in the room. A deep voice behind me roared, “Stop, stop doing that to my baby girl.” Huh? What was this man talking about? We made a plan that very morning; there had been no objection. She was a full code. She was 8 years old. She was awake and talking to me less than a half hour ago as I headed down to dinner. He bellowed this time, “I don’t want you to keep doing CPR. I hope you are hearing me? I am talking to you.” Astonished, I answered “Sir, I am hearing you, but I cannot stop. I do not have that authority. The attending is the only person who can make that decision with you. He is on his way. I am sorry, but I must keep going.” He began to cry.<br /><br /> The respiratory therapist was as stunned as I was. While providing chest compressions, I naively believed Rose was going to be fine; we were going to save her. The team was prepping the OR, and the surgeon was on his way. Her father wanted to speak with the attending physician in the ICU before any additional intervention. Within 7 minutes of her collapse, our attending arrived, spoke with her father, and authorized discontinuing CPR. I stopped providing chest compressions; she was asystolic before I climbed off the bed. The flat line never faltered. She was dead.<br /><br /> Feeling sick to my stomach, I could not cry until reality set in a few hours later. Then I was sobbing for days. How did he let her go? Does he not know we cut patients open and save lives? The shock wore off slowly and then a week later, we reviewed the autopsy report. It provided a remarkable lesson never to be forgotten. The tumor had not just been sitting on her heart; it had attached itself and snaked its way into her heart and the large vessels returning blood to her heart.  If we had cut open her chest, it would have been traumatic, chaotic, and she would have perished regardless. Somehow, her father knew better than the health care team, what was best for his child. I was not ready, yet he was prepared to let her go and made the right decision.<br /><br />All identifying information has been changed to protect patient privacy.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Zorro4/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 07.03.2017.

303	111	2	Physicians Have A Duty To Respond To Emergencies If They Can	Some time ago, I discovered the best reason I can think of to respond to medical emergencies yet.<br /><br /> “Did you save that man, mommy?” my 4 year old daughter asked while looking at the dented vintage red VW bug in front of her school.<br /><br /> “No, I was there to help him if he needed me”, I answered. I had been stopped on a two lane road with my left turn signal blinking to turn into the driveway of her preschool. I was five minutes early, which is as unusual as the events that unfolded next. Two cars behind me a driver was attempting to pass the line of cars and tried to stop, realizing it was unsafe. He skidded leftward into oncoming traffic as a group of motorcycles passed going the opposite way. The sound of shattering glass followed as the motorcycle and automobile collided.<br /><br /> The school windows were open due to the warm weather so the children heard the loud crash. Traffic going the opposite direction came to a complete stop, blocking the driveway to the school. I was unable to turn in to the parking lot, so I turned off the engine, got out, and yelled for someone to call 9-1-1.  A firefighter was in the car behind me and we reached the injured motorcyclist about the same time.<br /><br /> He assessed the victims’ neurologic status and I checked ABC’s and unzipped his jacket for better exposure. He was coherently speaking with us and looked stable on initial assessment, so we agreed to keep him immobilized until the paramedics arrived and could properly stabilize his C-spine. I will not bore you with the details of emergency care as that is not the main point of this story.<br /><br /> The teachers let the children know none of their parents were injured and would be coming to get them soon.  In all the chaos, parents were able to pull into the driveway (someone moved my vehicle to a safer location), pick up their children, and leave. My middle children, ages 4 and 6, knew I was waiting with the injured motorcyclist for help to arrive.  Unbeknownst to me, my daughter kept asking to go outside and survey the scene. Medicine might just be in her future.<br /><br /> All four of my children have spent a great deal of time in my office over the years; they visit me before school and “work” there on early release days putting together charts or doing clerical tasks.  They have entertained siblings of patients, held the hands of children receiving immunizations, and reviewed x-rays with patient permission. They know what physicians do.<br /><br /> “Mom, I know you care about people and try to help them when they are hurt,” said my 6 year old the next morning at breakfast while we discussed the previous day’s events. Based on this experience, I have come to the conclusion physicians have a duty to respond to emergencies if they can.<br /><br /> When an accident occurs literally next to me and I do not to respond, what am I teaching other people about physicians? More importantly, what message am I sending to my own children?<br /><br /> Our children are always watching us. A dozen children at school that day are patients of mine.  Three mothers in line picking up their children walked to the scene and were visibly relieved to see me standing there.  “Oh good, you are here.”  The teachers, motorcyclist, and his friends were grateful as well.<br /><br /> As physicians, we have more training than any other healthcare worker in medicine. We should respect our vast knowledge base and utilize it to ease the suffering of others if we are able. Our profession is an honorable one. Comforting others is a calling, not a job to which we clock in and out of every day. That fact is what truly sets physicians apart. When the time comes, I hope you help without hesitation when called upon to be a Good Samaritan. Personally, it reminds me of the reasons I became a physician in the first place, prompts me to be thankful just for being alive, and hopefully helps my children develop more compassion and empathy for others in the world.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Danny Chapman/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 04.04.2017.

304	112	2	Kneecaps and Newborn babies	Are you going to be a mother for the first time? If yes, then congratulations! Often, we get confused regarding the health of a newborn as there are some obvious differences of physical structure of a bay with that of a full grown human being.<br /><br /> For first time mothers are babies born with kneecaps become one of the most asked questions. Here are some of the facts you do need to know regarding the kneecaps and whether it should be there in a newborn’s body. Give it a read.<br /><br /> Ø  For adults, the kneecap is a patella which is formed at the end of the femur. This bone structure helps the knee work properly as well as remain responsible for the proper functioning of the knee including muscles and proper joints. If you have a newborn baby with you, they don’t have kneecaps per se in the sense that they don’t have bones in their body.<br /><br /> Ø  For the bone structure of a newborn, they have cartilage which are the premature stage of the bone in our bodies. All our bones were once in the cartilage form. The process of cartilages turning into bones is called ossification. This process is a slow one indeed, and it takes more than three years for a baby in its kneecap. Therefore, if it takes much time, don’t get worried for nothing. This is a normal physiological process that is slightly time-consuming.<br /><br /> Ø  Make sure you are taking your baby through enough physical exercise. Otherwise, the baby will gain fat in its childhood which often creates unnecessary problems during the ossification.<br /><br /> Ø  The patella turns into bone and starts functioning properly when the baby grows. All this time, the cartilage goes through the process of ossification, and this is why the process of physical exercise is so important for them.<br /><br /> Ø  Many think, that the human kneecap is made of bones from the very time of their birth. This is a misconception and now you know how a kneecap is formed, with time. For a newborn, a kneecap is cartilages that are roughly attached to the tendon at the end part of the femur. So, make sure you are taking proper care of the baby’s health when the bones are not formed properly and the kneecap is going through the process of ossification.<br /><br /> Ø  Knees are the most important organ in a human body after heart. All our movements, our balance in the lower parts of our body is actually maintained by the patella tuned kneecap. So, keep strict care of the patella of your newborn. You don’t need some unwarranted problems to arise for the child when then grow up to be adults.<br /><br /> Ø  Also, don’t panic when someone tells you they have babies with proper kneecaps. No one has that. It takes time and is a natural process for all the human beings alike.<br /><br /> Now you know the answer to the question of do newborn babies have kneecaps. All the best for your newborn!<br />Article last time updated on 18.07.2017.	Diego Wii	2017-07-18 00:00:00	341	m2m
305	112	2	Vaginal Douching During Pregnancy: Just Say No	"Many young women douche for various reasons. However, they are unaware of the potential risks involved with this procedure.

306	112	2	Understanding the risks of smoking e-cigarettes during pregnancy	To-be moms who smoke, especially for the first time, struggle to keep the stick out of their hand. So, a lot of them tend to go for e-cigarettes instead, thinking that they will cause less harm since the nicotine is not entering the system. However, there are some finer details that a lot of people are not aware of when it comes to these electronic cigarettes.<br /><br /> To put it in simple words, E-Cigarettes During Pregnancy is not at all a good choice since it is harmful for both the mother and the baby. In order to fully comprehend the risks associated with this habit when it comes to pregnancy, we need to first understand what the basic difference between e-cigarettes and normal cigarette is.<br /><br />Understanding the difference<br /><br /> E-cigarettes are basically electronic devices which contains a kind of liquid. This liquid has various chemicals present within it with a concentrated amount of nicotine. Now when the cigarette is lighted the water with the nicotine it is gets heated up and produces a water vapour that is inhaled. Since one inhales the water vapour coming from the cigarettes it is also referred to as vaping. Now the main difference between regular cigarettes is that in case of a regular cigarette the smoke is produced when nicotine burns with tobacco and the fumes that we inhale contains various harmful elements. However, the presence of nicotine in both these types of cigarettes is almost always the same and hence e-cigarettes are no way less harmful than the regular ones and not at all advisable for someone who is pregnant.<br /><br /> In fact, there are various reports that show how little people are aware of the harmful effects of these e-cigarettes. People tend to believe that these are way safer than the regular ones and some of them are also of the opinion that they do not contain nicotine since they taste different. However, on the other, it has been proven that due to the presence of nicotine, e-cigarettes too can become a harmful addiction!<br /><br />The risks of vaping when pregnant<br /><br />  It is best to stay away from any form of cigarettes when you are pregnant since you are not just harming yourself but you are also harming the baby. The risks of vaping when pregnant are manifold. Nicotine is the element that causes maximum harm to the baby and that is present in substantial amounts inn e-cigarettes. Apart from some of the common consequences like still birth, miscarriage, deformation in the baby’s growth and various other complications, there might be even rare conditions in the baby and its organs might not even be able to fully develop if one does not stop smoking during pregnancy. In fact, the point is not just about stopping smoking regular cigarettes, but it is more about not putting any nicotine inside your body.<br /><br /> So, the main conclusion to arrive at from this is that e-cigarette smoking is bad for you and your baby. If you are having difficulties to quit the stick, it is best if you consult an addiction counsellor if you know that you are pregnant or want to stop this harmful habit. <br />Article last time updated on 15.06.2017.

307	112	2	How to select the right sleeping option for your baby	Just like everybody needs sleep after a day’s tiring work, similarly, every baby too needs its sleep, especially the newborn ones. You will always see that the newborns are dozing in your arms or have their eyes closed. These little cuties need their sleep and hence you must make sure that you have the best sleeping options lined up for them.<br /><br /> Well one might just wonder over here that why do newborns seem to be asleep all the time. The thing is pretty simple. They are used to sleeping and dozing most of the time when in the mother’s womb and hence once they come out they tend to stick to their sleeping habits and gradually come out of it. But, whatever it might when it comes to sleeping the proper comfort is necessary so that the baby can maintain a proper posture and for that you must consider the best newborn baby sleeping options! Here are some of the classical and not so classical one’s for you to choose from:<br /><br /> 1.      The Crib: Well, these are everybody’s favorite. Though it is not advisable that you bring the newborn home and directly place it in the crib. Try to sleep with the baby beside and then after a few months you can place it in the crib. These are pretty easily available and hence very commonly used. However, cribs are really expensive and they have larger areas than what your newborn might need which will actually cause discomfort for the baby since it is used to sleeping in a warm and cozy surrounding- its mother’s womb.<br /><br /> 2.      The bassinet: This is another option that you can consider for your baby. These are cozier than cribs since they are smaller in size and hence have that warm factor that your baby will be missing in case of a crib. However, when it comes to bassinets they are not exactly easy to move around in the house since they do not come with any wheels and the number of designs that you will find for these are also limited.<br /><br /> 3.      The co-sleeper: This is probably one of the most convenient options that you have when it comes to sleeping options for babies. These are just like cribs, except that they are shorter in height and hence when you place it right by the bed, you can easily pick up the baby in your arms as and when needed!<br /><br /> 4.      Baby hammocks: You can now literally rock your baby to sleep without lifting a finger thanks to this remarkable of all the sleeping options for the newborn baby. These have an inherent rocking motion that sets off once you put the baby inside it and it will create the motion that will help the baby to fall asleep easily.<br /><br /> 5.      Moses basket: If you are looking for a cheap option that will help you in carrying your baby around then you might want to try this one. However, this is one is not too favorable for your baby’s posture.<br /><br /> So, if you want to make sure you get the best sleeping option for your baby, then pick one from the top five that you have listed above!<br />Article last time updated on 15.06.2017.

308	112	2	Answering the age-old debate about kneecaps in babies	There is an unending mystery about the development of human life, particularly babies. And if you are about to be a mom soon, then it is going to be a pretty overwhelming time coming up for you. You will be asked plenty of questions about your baby, half of which you do not even know yourself!<br /><br /> Well, here is one question that you will definitely come across- are babies born with kneecaps? Does your baby have a knee cap? Wondering what that means? Well, not to worry, here’ s are some facts about kneecaps that will definitely help you to understand what kneecaps exactly are and how and in what way they develop in babies-<br /><br />What is a kneecap?<br /><br /> Do you feel that slight bulge in your knee which is quite hard and strong? Well that is known as the patella. This patella is what the knee cap is. It basically acts as a protective cover or sheathing that guards your ball and socket joint against the impact of injuries. The ball and socket joints are some of the most important joints in your body. The fact that you can run or bend your leg is only because of the ball and socket joint. If you hurt this joint then it is very likely that you will take a long time to recover from it. Hence the human body provides a natural cover for your joint in the knee area, which are the most important ball and socket joints apart from the one in your pelvic region. Thus, the kneecap is basically a protective measure that helps in protecting your knees.<br /><br />How does the patella or knee cap develop?<br /><br /> What you find as a bony structure as an adult, has not always been like that. Touch your ear lobe- do you feel the softness quality of it? Well, that is because it is a cartilage and not a bone. Cartilages are formed and from there bones are then formed. This process of bone formation from cartilages is known as ossification. When it comes to kids who are growing, this is why dairy products are necessary since they contain large amounts of calcium and vitamin D that helps in the absorption of calcium which in turn helps in the process of ossification.  Do you know why ossification is important for a growing child?<br /><br /> Well, remember the famous thing that all our mothers used to say, “Have your milk, then you will have stronger bones!” This is because as a child you have cartilages in place of bones. These cartilages began to grow stronger with ossification and bone structures are created. So if someone asks you do newborn babies have kneecaps you can safely conclude that no they do not because they are born with cartilages in place of bones. The knee cap develops over a long period of time to form the hard and bony structure that you see today. Knee caps or the bony patella is completely formed during the time of puberty.<br /><br /> So, now you are armed with one more data about babies. So, go ahead and prepare yourself for the journey of motherhood!<br />Article last time updated on 15.06.2017.	Diego Wii	2017-06-15 00:00:00	260	m2m
309	112	2	Pregnancy Tests: True Pregnancy or False Result?	Are you and your partner trying? Do you want to know for sure whether you are pregnant or not? Well the easiest way to detect at home whether you are pregnant or not is through a home pregnancy test. But did you know that not all pregnancy home tests can be trusted?<br /><br />The home pregnancy test<br /><br /> You can do a home pregnancy test with the help of a pregnancy kit which are widely available in the market today. But the best way to confirm your pregnancy is through an ultrasound which can actually capture the image and detect the presence of the growing foetus in your body. When women experience typical pregnancy syndromes like fatigue, nausea, craving for a particular food item or repulsion towards certain things like food, smell, a missed period etc, they generally opt for a home pregnancy test. In fact when you visit a doctor, she or he will first ask you whether you have done a test or not. However the results of the test cannot always be trusted. It can show a Pregnancy Test False Negative or just the opposite for various reasons. You might actually be pregnant and that might not show up in the test! So it is always best to consult a doctor if you feel changes that are typically associated with pregnancy.<br /><br />How can a home pregnancy test be wrong?<br /><br /> First and foremost you need to understand that most of the pregnancy kits are hardly ever faulty. Out of 10, 8 might be, but the chances are extremely rare. So how come you have a false negative? Well there are a number of reasons behind it, to understand which you need to know how these kits function. You need your urine sample, preferably the first urine in the morning, because these kits use the sample to detect whether HCG or the pregnancy hormone is present in your urine or not. However, the amount of detectable HCG in your urine will vary and that is the main cause behind these tests yielding false results.<br /><br /> Your test can show you a false negative if you do it do early. It will take about 10-14 days for the fertilised egg to attach to the uterine wall and initiate enough HCG hormones that will become detectable in your urine. If you take the test within 48-72hours after the time of conception, then there are high chances that it will turn out to be negative. So it is best to try the test again after a week or so if you feel the symptoms. Another uncommon but a possible reason for yielding a false negative is that if too much HCG is present in your urine; more than what the kits can detect.<br /><br /> In order to understand why a pregnancy test can be wrong and show a false positive, you have to take into consideration factors like residual HCG in your urine from an early miscarriage, HCG left from any kind of fertility treatment that you might be going through etc.<br /><br /> Though pregnancy tests at home are hardly wrong, if you want to be absolutely sure, check up with your doctor and get an ultrasound done. <br />Article last time updated on 06.06.2017.

310	112	2	Is Douching Safe During Pregnancy?	Douching is a process to clean your vagina with water or other fluids such as vinegar or iodine. The liquid is inserted through a tube or nozzle into the vagina. According to some medical experts, women should never douche, regardless of whether they are pregnant or not. According to a US Department of Health and Human Services publication, nearly a quarter of women in the age group 15 to 44 years douche.<br /><br />Does douching alter my fertility? Is douching during pregnancy safe for me and my baby?<br /><br /> Douching as often as once a month may make it difficult for you to conceive. However, research suggests that douching after sex has no impact on the odds of getting pregnant. Douching has been associated with a higher incidence of ectopic pregnancy. This means that your likelihood of conceiving are reduced.<br /><br /> If you douche during pregnancy, there is an increased risk of delivering prematurely. Therfore, douching while pregnant is not recommended.<br /><br /> The health problems associated with douching can be long-lasting. They include bacterial vaginosis, infection in the vagina, and risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. Douching can facilitate a number of health problems since it alters the balance of the vaginal flora and the natural acidity found in the vagina. This means that, along with the harmful bacteria, the good bacteria are eliminated as well.<br /><br /><br /><br /> When you douce, your levels of vaginal bacteria change considerably, increasing your risk of yeast infections and irritation in the vaginal area. Studies also point to the fact that, when you douche, you increase your chances of exposure to phthalates. These are chemicals that are used to soften plastic or vinyl, as in the case of toys or personal grooming products.<br /><br /> Many women who douch convey to their doctors that they undertook this procedure for hygienic reasons. However, one of the the main problems with douching is that it impacts considerably on both the benefitial as well as the harmful bacteria in the vagina area.<br /><br />Then, what should I do to clean my vagina when I am pregnant?<br /><br /> When you bath, the outside of your vagina can be washed with warm water. Regarding the inside, it is preferable if you let it clean itself with its mucus. If you have thick vaginal discharge or redness and irritation around the region of your vagina, consult with your doctor.<br />Article last time updated on 25.05.2017.

311	112	2	Is vaginal douche safe during pregnancy?	For all those wondering whether vaginal douche is safe during the course of pregnancy, here is a word of advice, No. The process involves cleaning the vagina with water or other fluids such as vinegar or iodine, and this is done by squirting the liquid through a nozzle or tube inserted in the vagina. According to research by eminent medical professionals, any woman, be it pregnant or not should not douche. But a quarter of women in the age bracket of 15 to 44 years do douche.<br /><br /> Douching once a month reduces the chances of being pregnant, and research suggests douching will not prevent you from becoming pregnant. Douching does increase the chances of ectopic pregnancy that makes it difficult to conceive in the future. If douching pregnancy is undertaken, the possibility of an early delivery cannot be ruled out. Some of the other health problems related with douching include bacterial vaginosis, HIV causes AIDS, dryness or irritation in the vagina. A recent study, which was published in the month of August that when you douched for the last six months, it was associated with an increase paving way for a higher rate of infections. This led to all types of genital human papillomvirus and there are 200 of them along with a risk of high HPV types. This includes a dozen of them that can cause cervical cancer along with other types of cancer, while other HPV types cause genital warts.<br /><br /> Another study pointed that vaginal douche does increase the exposure to phthalates. They are chemicals used to soften plastic and vinyl, as in the case of toys, there are also used in personal care products and cosmetics such as douches. They have been linked to developmental or behavioural issues to children who have been exposed in the womb.<br /><br /> Why do women douche is the thing which we need to figure out? In a study, which was conducted in Los Angeles asked 141 women, whether they douched and the answer was yes. They found out that 6 out of 10 African women douched and 4 out of 10 Latin American women douched, which proves that the former tends to douche more.<br /><br /> Most women who douche in Los Angeles told that they did it for maintaining their personal hygiene. But the problem is that douching goes on to disturb the balance of the good along with the bad bacteria in the body.<br /><br /> Now the question is what you are supposed to do when you need to clean the vagina? When you bathe, wash the outside of it with warm water, and from the inside, the best mechanism would be to let the vagina clean itself by forming mucus. You need to figure out that a clean and healthy vagina will not smell like a rose garden, and you should get in touch with your doctor if you tend to have a thick vaginal discharge with or without any form of swelling, pain while urinating or having sex as well as swelling or redness in the area around your vagina.<br />Article last time updated on 17.05.2017.

312	112	2	What To Tell Your Patient With Gestational Diabetes	Gestational diabetes is a common common condition during pregnancy. Luckily, there are effective ways to keep it under control.<br /><br />What are the causes and symptoms?<br /> There are several maternal risks of diabetes in pregnancy. The most common symptoms of type 1 diabetes are increased thirst, constant hunger, urination, blurred vision, weight loss, and extreme fatigue. This can make your pregnancy journey more difficult.<br /> Most pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes do not have type 1 diabetes but type 2 diabetes. The most common symptoms of type 2 diabetes are bladder or kidney problems, increased urination and thirst, fatigue and need to have meals constantly.<br /><br /> Gestational diabetes may have a genetic component. However, this has not been confirmed yet.<br /><br /> When you are pregnant, your placenta will make hormones which will accumulate sugar in your blood. Your pancreas will make enough insulin to handle everything. However, if you do not produce enough insulin (or if your pancreas produces too much of it), your blood sugar levels will be disturbed. This will then lead to gestational diabetes.How will it harm the baby?<br /> If you detect the problem during your early stages of pregnancy, there are treatments that can be very effective. With good monitoring and treatment, your glucose levels can be kept under control.<br /><br /> Mothers who have uncontrolled gestational diabetes have very large babies. This is known as fetal macrosomia. This condition makes the delivery very difficult and often requires a C-section. It can also increase your blood pressure levels, which will further complicate things.<br /> The best way to protect yourself from gestational diabetes is to avoid stress as much as possible, to limit your sugar consumption and to be active. Go for walks, stay active and keep a watch on your diet. Get regular tests and let your doctor know if you experience symptoms that worry you.<br />Article last time updated on 14.05.2017.

313	112	2	How to breastfeed after surgery	Most women would have had surgery of some kind. This may include breast reduction to reduce the size of the breasts or augmentation to increase the size of it. Now the question that might come to your mind is can you breastfeed with implants? Yes, you can do so, but how successful it will be depending to a large extent on the type of surgery you had in the first place. For the matter of fact even if you are able to produce some amount of milk it would be to better to supplement with a dose of supplements.<br /><br /> Milk is produced in the glandular tissue of the breast and then travels through the nipples with what is known as the milk ducts. If you had surgery of any time, then you need to cross check the fact on whether your milk ducts were interrupted or damaged in any way. In case of some surgeries milk ducts are cut whereas in case of others it is not the case. Even if they are cut, it may go on to heal after surgery and be able to produce milk after the course of surgery. If you had any form of surgery and still want to breastfeed the baby, then you should get in touch with a doctor to obtain the necessary go ahead. If this is the case, you can go on to provide them with the necessary medical records of your surgery and make sure that they are aware of the fact that you had any form of breast surgery and they tend to focus more on the growth of the baby.<br /><br />Breast augmentation or reduction<br /><br /> Most of the increase in the size of the breasts is undertaken through the technique of silicon transplantation. It depends on the size of your breasts and how much you want to enlarge or reduce them is the key. When it is the case of increasing the size of the breasts, implants are being placed on the natural tissue of your breasts or beneath the muscles of your chest. Most of the women who have had this operation done goes on to answer the question of can I breastfeed with implants relatively easily.<br /><br /> The implants do not interfere with the breastfeeding mechanism as they are placed naturally under your tissue and if they are inserted it might go on to cause a problem.<br /><br /> You need to take note of the fact that any form of breast surgery is bound to reduce the amount of milk you are bound to produce. Some of the methods which remove or attach the nipple are most likely to cause problems and leave breastfeeding a thing of the past.<br /><br /> If a woman has had their breast size reduced still she can go on to produce milk and feed the baby. But the amount of milk that they produce might not be enough and they would need to supplement it with some sort of formula to be honest.<br />Article last time updated on 10.05.2017.

314	114	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	623	m2m
315	116	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

316	116	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

317	116	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

Of course, the upholders of the Ukrainian government would say that mine has been planted by ""terrorists."" Another concerned person of this incident is the older brother of the girl - he also got injured by the land mine.<br /><br /> Their mother came to me for a doctor's note for her 14-year-old daughter who took care of her 5-year-old sister in the hospital. The mother had to take care of her one-month-old baby and therefore she could take care of her other daughter in the surgical department.<br /><br /> The Children's Hospital has the most necessary medicine. In pharmacies they have a few drugs that got a lot more expensive. The government of DPR (Donetsk People Republic) began with payments, but these payments do not correspond to the higher prices. However, it is better than no payments from the Ukraine (Ukrainian government stopped all kinds of payments – pension, benefits, salaries in August 2014. How did people survive? Only they know…).<br /><br /> Prices for everything - medicines, food and other goods also got more expensive due to the ongoing Ukrainian blockade of Donetsk. Some supermarket chains closed because of this blockade.<br /><br /> On the photo above this blog entry you can see a house which I pass on my way to work. It is damaged by shelling, some windows are smashed, some windows are sealed with adhesive tape - it saves you from broken glass and people say it even helps to preserve the glass (my windows are also sealed - but with transparent tape).

319	118	2	About the importance of measles vaccination	"A personal acquaintance that had measles completely convinced me of the need for vaccination.<br /><br /> I have a very personal relationship with this infection:<br /> When I was a child measles vaccine was administered at the age of 1 year and 16 years.<br /><br /> I got the vaccination aged 1 year... But the group of silly 16-year-old schoolgirls was scared of injections and refused vaccination.<br /><br /> When my son was 1 year he got his measles vaccine. I was 24, I was a medical intern and we conducted all vaccinations. Exactly a month after his vaccinations I became ill with measles. It was as follows: I was in the theater, listening to ""La Traviata"" and after the spectacle I barely could get home because I was feeling so bad.<br /> The last thing I remember that this night I was trying to take aspirin and dropped the kettle because my hands were shaking. The next 10 days, I do not remember anything.<br /><br /> They said that I was woken up by a fever. I received an injection antipyretic and 15 minutes later I went back to sleep for 2-3 hours until the next temperature rise. Skin rash appeared on me and I had all the symptoms:  Small, flat blotches that blended into one another. My cheeks and forehead were reddened first. Then the rash spread down the arms and trunk, then over the thighs and legs. The rash disappeared in the same order, but pigment spots still remained for a long time - at least a month.<br /><br /> Fortunately, I have not had measles encephalitis. But I did have measles pneumonia. I caught measles from a neighbor who lived on the floor above. My son didn’t fall sick with measles.<br /><br /> Of course, in addition to the rash and fever I had all other measles symptoms – dry cough (very painful), runny nose, sore throat and conjunctivitis. But I do not know if I had Koplik spots - tiny white papules that are on the inner lining of the cheek in the first 1-2 days of the illness.<br /><br /> Commonly, the measles virus incubates without signs for the first 10 to 14 days after a person is infected. Often measles begin like a normal cold and only after 2-3 days the typical rash appears on the skin. Koplik spots often stay unnoticed.<br /><br /> A person with measles spreads the virus for about 8 days – approximately 4 days before the rash appears and 4 days after. Complications of measles may include the following: ear infection, bronchitis, laryngitis, croup, pneumonia, encephalitis, pregnancy problems - pregnancy loss, preterm labor or low birth weight, and thrombocytopenia.<br /><br /> The main risk factor of measles is for unvaccinated persons, especially young children. The measles virus is highly contagious spread by coughing and sneezing.<br /><br /> In order to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks WHO recommends administrating 2 doses of vaccine.<br /><br /> Immunization against measles for one child costs about US $1.Unfortunately, we have no vaccines since July. The war...<br /><br /> Measles - one of the diseases in which the group’s immunity is particularly important. The presence of a pool of vaccinated immune people prevents the spread of the virus.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Maria Bobrova/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 21.04.2015."

320	118	2	Life as a doctor in a shelled area in Ukraine	"It is very, very scary, when you hear the shot and then the packet’s whistle and then – explosion. If an explosion is far - 500 meters is far – you can hear just sharp sounds and you can continue doing your thing. If your windows shakes – you should go to the hallway.<br /><br /> If the whole house shakes – you must run to the hallway, lie on the floor and wish that the next packet will not come to you.<br /><br /> Every day. Every night. At every moment the shell can fly to your home and destroyed it, kill you or your family.<br /><br /> After such a night you go to work. A shell can fly on the bus or to the bus stop. Your husband wishes you won't go to work but you get salary albeit 2 months delayed. Your family needs this money - it is the only income. Ukrainian government refused to pay pensions to people who had been working in Ukraine all their lives.<br /><br /> Ukrainian checkpoints do not miss to control the city trucks with food and medications. Insulin, antibiotics, antipyretics, antihypertensive, anticonvulsants became scarce and very expensive.<br /><br /> After the doctor’s appointments I go on home visits. The air is abuzz with gunfire and explosions. I walk past five-storey buildings in which glass is about to fall out. Scary.<br /><br /> One day, the bus came directly under firing. Between the two explosions I could leap out and fall under the garage wall. Before the next explosion, I managed to go down into the cellar of the nearby house. I stood there, pressed against the wall and could only think of the fact that the shells explode close to where my home is. And that my husband and son were there. As soon as the shelling ended I ran home. We took all our animals (our doggy, two zebra finches, budgie, three chinchillas (one was only a few days) and moved into my mother's place to a more quiet area. More quiet area means that the buildings are not shaking from the explosions there.<br /><br /> We waited for the announced February 15 truce. These two weeks especially the last days before the February 15 were very scary. The city was trembling from explosions. The factory where my son works as veterinary doctor (in the factory zoo) was shelled. My son has outlasted shelling in the cellar and then bandaged the wounded at the entrance of the factory. At the same time, in the morning,  a bus station was shelled, two drivers and several passengers were killed.<br /><br /> Finally, we have lived to silence. Sometimes the shellings begin again but they are weaker.<br /><br /> Products are very grew and they became less. Medications are still scarce. Ukraine blocks Donetsk and we often remember the blockade of Leningrad. Ukrainians tell us that we deserved shelling and blockade because we voted at a referendum and expressed our opinion. All this is happening in the 21st century, in a country that calls itself democratic and whose leaders claim that they are Europeans.<br /><br /> According to the UN about 5,000 civilians were killed during the war in the Donbass. In fact, that number is 10 times more.<br /><br />The President of Ukraine said about the inhabitants of Donetsk: ""Their children will sit in cellars."" The Ukrainian government is trying to implement a program of their President.<br /><br /> Earth, Europe, Ukraine, Donbass, 21st Century.<br />Article last time updated on 09.03.2015."	Dr. med.

321	118	2	Unusual rash	It was a very unusual rash. There were small (up to 5 mm long) blisters at the edges of both palms and soles of my little patient. It could not be chicken pox since the patient had that a year ago.<br /> Maybe it was an allergic reaction, but to what allergen? What changed in the girl's environment or diet?<br /> The mother mentioned that new sand was brought to the kindergarten's sandboxes the day before they consulted me. However, I asked myself why her daughter’s throat was red while doing a home visit and examining the girl (in our medical culture, home visits are standard for routine complaints).<br /> The mother's main concern was if it was okay to send the girl back to kindergarten tomorrow.<br /> I actually didn’t know. Two days before there was nothing on her skin, then wheals appeared and turned into blisters the next day. She already had chickenpox. Her throat was red. She had no fever, her temperature was normal. The rash did not itch.<br /> I told the mother I didn’t know what it was.  I told her: “Let me examine her again tomorrow and also get CBC tomorrow morning please, so I can see the results in the afternoon.”<br /> CBC was compatible with a viral infection. There were no cells pathognomic for an acutely allergic state.<br /> Then, during the re-exam, I saw new sore spots in her mouth.<br /> A few days later, a 3-year-old boy who lives nearby, developed similar symptoms.<br /> It turned out there were more than 50 of such cases that autumn.<br /> I think that it was the hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which is a mild viral exanthem. It is usually young children that are affected. It is considered to be caused by a coxsackievirus.<br /> This virus spreads orally by airborne contamination, by contact with nasal secretions, saliva, weeping blisters, droplets sprayed into the air after a cough or a sneeze, or by stool particles because young children often put their fingers in their mouth. Sometimes, adults are infected without symptoms and pass the virus to others.<br /> There is no specific treatment for hand-foot-and-mouth disease since it is self-limited. Intervention is necessary only if the child has difficulties eating because of oral lesions or when the child's condition gets worse and complications show.<br /> For preventing hand-foot-and-mouth disease good hygiene is effective.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kmrep/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 20.01.2015.

322	118	2	One of my working days	"Some patient voices:<br /><br />Patient: ""May I come in?""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Welcome, come in, what happened to you?""<br /><br />Patient: ""I want you to put my child on record. We moved here.""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Okay. Let's get his medical records. Where are you from?""<br /><br />Patient: ""Kremlin Avenue.  (Settlement October mine*).""<br /><br /><br /> Patients come from everywhere: Petrovka*, Spartac*, Putilovka*, again Putilovka*, Gornyak (Miner)*, Azotniy*, Putilovka*, Petrovka*, Krasnogorovka*, Avdeevka*.<br /> In the early summer many people were from Mar’inka* - and they all remained here, in my district.<br /> Their voices are ringing from tears:<br /><br />  ""Our house is intact yet, my mother’s house down the street was demolished.""<br /><br />  ""Blown.""<br /><br />  ""Today I went after things - again, barely managed to escape.""<br /><br />  ""When a house next door blew off the roof, I decided to leave.""<br /><br />  ""Our house burned down. (Mother and her five-year-old daughter are laughing). The main thing is that we are safe and rescued the cat."" (A clever mother, well done. Her daughter hasn’t got post-traumatic neurosis)<br /><br />  ""We were shelled every day, I cannot stand it any longer.<br /><br />  <br /><br />""I'm afraid even to send him (the son) to school.""<br /><br />  ""Don't be afraid, it's quiet here. Not a single shell splinter fell.""<br /><br />""All the same, I'm afraid, I'm afraid of any noise.""<br /><br />  <br /><br />  Patient: ""We do not have the medical records, will you take us?""<br /><br />  Doctor: ""Don't worry, I'll take you. We’ll make new records, get the paperwork to the school and kindergarten. Everything will be solved.""<br /><br />  <br /><br />  Other patient: ""We have moved, will you take us?""<br /><br /> I don't send them to the chief, as I should. I just type them in the census, take the records if they have one and make new records for those who haven't.<br /> In my opinion, they are already more than those who left early in the summer.<br /> Today: another shelling. Nothing special. This is a routine district doctor’s work in a city which is shelled on a daily basis.<br /> The area where my doctor's district is located is one of the few without shelling. I go to work with the sounds of cannon fire. The Government of Ukraine said that they won't pay our salaries. This means 150€ per month and less for me.<br /> Maybe, I should explain you something regarding the features of ukranian medical care.<br /> Our government started the reform of medical care. Most therapists and pediatricians were retrained to family physicians. But most of us are trying to work in their specialty – and our bosses are trying to help us in this (if they are smart bosses), because it is very difficult to change the speciality after 23 years of work.<br /> District pediatrician should observe at least 800 children. Family doctors – 1,400 adults and children. We had enough doctors before but some doctors left the city because of the war, so I am working on three districts - for three doctors. I should observe, do routine exams (monthly children under one year and annually up to 18 years), vaccinate, diagnose and treat 2,400 children (in fact they are a little less - about 2,000). And I have to go to the call and patronage (four times in first month of life, twice – doctor and twice - nurse) to their home.<br /> And of course I should write a lot of records and reports - at least 5 per examination of the patient and 5 monthly.<br /> * - names of villages, towns and urban areas, which are shelled on a daily basis.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2014."

323	118	2	Low-grade fever as beginning of duodenal ulcer	Her mother has been taking her to many doctors. The girl was seen by an endocrinologist, an otolaryngologist, a neurologist- in short, by all possible medical specialties whom the mother found, who had remained in the city under siege at that time (most of the physicians fled the bombings). Why so many specialists? Because our patients are accustomed to running for a specialist. They apparently think that any generalist – a pediatrician, an internist, a family physician – is like a low-level medical manager, a gate-keeper, that he or she is good for requesting tests and consults, especially where free medicine is concerned - if invalids, pensioners and their relatives will request it and persist.<br /><br /> But let us get back to my patient.<br /><br /> She had endured a lot of testing – all results were nonrevealing, normal. The specialists, one and all, zoomed in on the most “fashionable” diagnosis of exclusion - autonomic dysfunction. However, each of the physicians prescribed some medication or other just in case – iodine, sedatives, vitamins, supplements, immunostimulants and homeopathy. The girl’s mother bought them all and gave them to the child - whose condition did not improve.<br /><br /> After a long interview I found out that the girl is experiencing nausea every morning. She also complained of stomach ache – without any connection to food intake.<br /><br /> Pain in epigastric and paraumbilical regions was elicited on palpation.<br /><br /> I offered the treatment of gastritis without H.pylori therapy, and gastric imaging by endoscopy - however, the family refused the latter.<br /><br /> The girl did well with treatment, however her symptoms were still occasionally recurring.<br /><br /> In a couple of weeks, I persuaded them to do FGDS. It was indeed a duodenal bulb ulcer. This time I prescribed eradication.<br /><br /> The girl is doing well, but continues to have occasional low-grade fevers. What is it? The ulcer not entirely healed? An infection? Thermoneurosis, an enteric dysregulation?<br /><br /> I cannot evaluate this, because the only children's hospital with relevant clinic capabilities was damaged during the shelling, and cannot be used.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />hemeroskopion/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 06.11.2014.

324	118	2	Routine district doctor's work in a shelled city	"The child's  mother tried to find a pediatrician, but  she said, “There is a lock on the clinic door, and there is no one”, in a war-riddled town.  So she gave the girl  an antipyretic, and blamed teething for the fevers. <br /><br /> The  mother talked about this to her friend – an older and a more experienced woman - and this friend found me through Facebook.<br /><br /> I am a pediatrician and a family physician, I work in another clinic,  in a different medical district. <br /><br /> I should not have taken on this child's case,  according to the rules of our healthcare system, crossing the borders of regional providers. Yet,  we really did not have enough doctors in the area,  because of the war-related closing of most clinics. <br /><br /> The baby's general exam was within normal - she was an active, cheerful child. Her gums were pink, not swollen - so the ""teething"" hypothesis was not confirmed.  The nasopharyngeal exam was normal as well. This child had no evidence of an upper respiratory infection.  I have ordered urine and blood screening tests.<br /><br /> The mother returned from the laboratory discouraged:  the technicians told her that they did not have the chemicals needed to do the panel I ordered, they could only do ""the minimal three"" - the leukocyte count, hemoglobin, and ESR.<br /><br /> - Whatever I can get, - I thought...<br /><br /> Hemoglobin was normal, WBC - 11 , ESR – 15, both elevated. <br /><br /> Urinalysis revealed  proteinuria, leukocyturia, multiple squamous epithelial cells.<br /><br /> “A kidney infection?” – I thought.<br /><br /> After that I hit upon the idea to ask the mother about the living conditions at her home. She told me that for the last month they had been living in a basement - it was used as a bomb shelter. They live next to the recently bombed City Youth Center, with daily shellings nearby.  In the basement it was cold and damp.<br /><br /> This connected the dots for me: despite all the efforts of the mother, the baby was in a chilly and damp area, possibly on a cold floor -  and kidney infection in infants may be asymptomatic, except for fever, in this case.<br /><br /> Appropriate treatment  was effected, and it helped -  in 10 days there was no fever, and the urinalysis normalized. <br /><br /> Nothing special. This is a routine district doctor’s work in a city which is shelled on a daily basis.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />John Kelly/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 06.10.2014."	Dr. med.

325	119	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	623	m2m
326	120	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

327	120	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

328	120	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

329	122	2	Why physicians need side gigs	At first, it may seem strange that “physician” and “side gig” are even used in the same sentence. As someone who talks about physician burnout and as the founder of the Physician Side Gigs Facebook group, I’ve been asked many times how adding yet another thing to the physician’s plate could possibly be a good idea.<br /><br /> And yet, I’m a strong believer that physicians should have additional revenue streams and pursue other interests. Why?<br /><br />The monetary benefits<br /><br />1. The obvious one: extra money.  This one speaks for itself.<br /><br />2. Tax benefits.  Since most physicians are W-2 employees, they don’t get a lot of the tax benefits that small businesses or 1099 workers receive.  Side gigs allow access to additional retirement plans and tax deductions.<br /><br />3. Establishing passive revenue streams.  I’m always surprised by how little we as physicians think about passive revenue streams.  We’re groomed to work 60+ hour work weeks, but our training doesn’t include lessons on how to make the most of our incomes once we finally start making a higher salary.  It’s a skillset that many don’t have time to develop, but even simple investments or partnerships can create significant side income streams, some of which require minimal work once set up.  It’s my hope that the Facebook group and this site will help connect people with these opportunities.<br /><br />The non-monetary benefits<br /><br /> For me, my writing and speaking have never been about the money.  Sure, the monetary benefits are wonderful, but more so than that, I love the benefits that have come along with pursuing my other passions.  These include:<br /><br />1. Creating job flexibility and financial security.  Having the ability to generate money outside of your day job gives you more flexibility to seek job options that are in line with the life you are trying to create.  When I talk to physicians about burnout, there’s often a feeling that people are stuck – worried about paying off student debt, unable to find part-time options, etc.  Having an additional income stream (or many) takes off some of the pressure to stay in a situation that may not be ideal.  It may helps to protect you financially in the event that you can’t practice clinical medicine anymore or have an unexpected break in employment.<br /><br />2. Expanding my network of physicians.  I’ve met so many interesting people through these pursuits.  Whether they are other like-minded physicians pursuing side ventures or physicians that have reached out to me because they’ve seen something I’ve written or saw me speak, I’ve made lots of new friends and connections.  This has incredible value – I’ve been able to help people on both ends of the job search, had interactions that have helped me in my own personal and professional life, and have found exciting opportunities that I never would have otherwise had access to.  I’m a strong believer that the more people you know, the more effective you can be in all of your pursuits and the more opportunities arise.<br /><br />3. Having something in my life that is my own — done on my terms.  With all the demands that come along with clinical medicine as well as those that come with parenting, I was really craving something that was uniquely me.  I’ve always enjoyed networking, mentoring, writing, and of course, talking.  While jobs and children come with relatively stringent deadlines, hours, and expectations, I can pursue my side gigs during pockets of free time, and can ramp up or down my pursuits depending on how busy things are in the rest of my life.<br /><br />4. Having an outlet to process my life in a fulfilling way.  Because of the nature of my side gig (writing and speaking about life in medicine), I’ve actually found it really helpful personally to talk about the aspects of medicine that aren’t conventionally discussed amongst physicians.  It’s also been wonderful to have these conversations with people who are facing the same challenges with work-life balance, the changing healthcare landscape, and other issues related to life in medicine.  I love being able to use my voice in the field to help others find happiness in medicine or to bring publicity to issues that I’d like to see generate more discussion.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />ajotasan/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 13.02.2018.

330	122	2	5 things physicians can do to protect themselves	As physicians, we’re groomed to take care of patients. During training, we don’t talk about compensation, work-life balance, or the business of medicine. In many ways, it’s actually frowned upon to do so, and our hierarchical systems discourage open conversation on these subjects. We also very rarely say ‘no’ during the course of our training, and this tendency stays with us for the remainder of our careers.<br /><br /> Ultimately, these things hurt us. Physician burnout is multifactorial, and so much of its rise can be attributed to institutional and administrative factors and the changing healthcare landscape. We can’t predict the future, but there are certain steps that we can take to protect ourselves:<br /><br />1. Don’t be afraid to ask uncomfortable questions. Yes, patient care always comes first, and I certainly don’t advocate a ‘me first’ mentality in the job interview process. However, although being a physician is a calling, it is also a job, and money and lifestyle do matter, not only for your own job satisfaction, but for that of your family.<br /><br /> If there are things that are matter to you, such as how many weeks of vacation the partners get, how often you get to eat lunch, or how often you get called in on call, ask these questions. Hopefully, groups are upfront with you with answers, because it’s also in their best interest to recruit someone who will be happy within the framework of their group. If there are certain topics they are avoiding talking about, keep your antenna up and dig deeper.<br /><br />2. Negotiate. Newsflash: groups expect you to negotiate, and almost always have some wiggle room built into their initial offer. I don’t care how competitive the job market is, if it’s academic or private, or how lucky you feel that they are even talking to you. As long as you do so tactfully, nobody is going to deny you a job for negotiating.<br /><br /> This applies to salary, benefits, days off, protected academic time, restrictive covenants, malpractice tails, you name it. The worst they can say is no. If they’ve made you an offer, they’ve already made a decision that they like you, and you should feel comfortable asking. Before you do so, do your research and try and find out what others in the group have been able to negotiate. That will give you more power at the bargaining table, as well as alert you to things that you may have thought were nonnegotiable. Once you’ve agreed to something, you’ll have a hard time dropping it later, so have the conversations before you sign on the dotted line.<br /><br />3. Network. The more people you know, the more you’ll hear through the grapevine. Although job boards and MGMA numbers are out there, the best jobs are often the ones that aren’t advertised, and survey numbers don’t do a great job of breaking down salaries by what job requirements are. Posting a job on a board or through a recruiter typically costs money, and groups are understandably more comfortable getting somebody who is a known entity.<br /><br /> Finding a job through a contact gives added security on both sides. Even after you’ve taken a job, it’s a great idea to keep up with your connections. It will allow you to keep a pulse on the rest of the market, hear about what steps groups are taking, and what solutions they’ve come up with to problems you may be having.<br /><br />4. Have a lawyer experienced in physician contracts review your contract. It’s amazing how many people do not have their contracts reviewed since they trust the people offering them the job. Many of those people regret it later. These lawyers have seen the problems caused by exclusions/inclusions in people’s contracts and will alert you to any red flags. Don’t fall under the, ‘well, this is the standard contract’ trap – group contracts are obviously set up to protect the employer and you should do the same for yourself.<br /><br />5. Know your deal breakers and don’t be afraid to say “no” or ask for additional compensation. This is the one I want to emphasize the most. Before and after contract negotiations, it is always in your employers best interest to get the most out of you, both financially and in workload. I think about it like this: when you call someone to your house for some work you need to be done, they aren’t shy about billing by the hour or even just to provide a quote. A lawyer isn’t timid about charging an hourly rate just to take a phone call.<br /><br /> Why don’t physicians value their time more? We’ve put in a ton of time in training, and yet so much of what we do is uncompensated. Yes, there are things we do out of personal interest, such as teach residents or sit on professional committees, but there are typically a lot of responsibilities added to our plate that weren’t part of our original contract agreements. I’m not saying to say no to them all – but if there’s something that you know will make you unhappy or be a huge time sink, don’t take it on. At the very least, don’t take it on without asking what you get in return.<br /><br /> If you flip the situation around and you were asking for more from your employer, I’m fairly certain there would be pushback on that end. If there is something that will actively make you unhappy on a regular basis, such as increasing the number of patients you have to see in a day or having to supervise a midlevel provider without any additional compensation, be willing to walk away from an existing job or wait for a better job in the job search.<br /><br /> Of course, it’s important to keep in mind that you’ll ideally be working with your employer/colleagues for a long time, and this is not a confrontation. Good working relationships require some give and take, and there are some battles that are not worth fighting. But please, put some thought into figuring out which ones are, and in those cases, don’t be afraid to do it. Believe in your value and your skillset. If you don’t ask, you can be sure that you won’t get it.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />ArtCoreStudios/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 07.11.2017.

331	122	2	Physician Burnout: The Radiology Report	COMPARISON: Innumerable articles on the topic and experiences of professional and personal contacts.<br /><br /> FINDINGS: The number of articles about physician burnout have increased significantly over the past few years, along with routine vocalization of said feelings. As with most terms with inherent sex appeal, the term “burnout” may overdramaticize and somewhat belittle the underlying sentiment.<br /><br /> Multiple different physicians are identified, each with unique circumstances, including varying depths of physician debt, practice and compensation structures, demographics, personal lives, subspecialties, and reasons for going into medicine. Many express discontent with recent trends in medicine, whether it be related to declining compensation and/or increasing workload, litigative aspects of medicine, work-life balance, or patient perceptions of physicians.<br /><br /> Despite this, the vast majority of physicians still love and believe in what they do. There is not yet frank collapse or obstruction of the medical system; however, there are moderate degenerative changes which warrant consideration of both local and systemic etiologies. These are all within normal limits of most professional careers, but borderline increased because of unique aspects of the necessity of services provided, humanistic nature of the profession, and length of training required.<br /><br /> IMPRESSION: Overall increase in use of the term physician burnout and in sentiment of discontent, which are nonspecific and mean different things to each physician. Clinical correlation* for root causes should be performed on an individual basis, and appropriate individual and systemic actions should be taken to ameliorate the situation. Close follow-up is indicated. Otherwise, the eventual downfall of the medical profession as we know it is not excluded.<br /><br /> * The use of vague terminology and recommendations for clinical correlation and appropriate action are used facetiously and should not be taken as endorsement or condoning the gratuitous use of such phrases in a clinical radiology report.<br /><br /> (Because sometimes my brain processes information in the form of a radiology report.)<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />445693/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

332	122	2	Don’t Assume That You Know What A Doctor Looks Like	As a South Asian, I have to say I’ve never been told I don’t look like a doctor on a racial basis. If anything, because of the number of South Asians in medicine in real life and in media, TV shows, and movies, people actually assume I’m in medicine … or an IT field.<br /><br /> However, I have had many people assume I’m a nurse (I’m female), ask how old I am and where I trained before letting me do a procedure (a question rarely asked to my older white male colleagues), and state their surprise that I don’t have an accent (presumably because many of the South Asian physicians they’ve seen are immigrants, and I’m part of the first generation of American born South Asian physicians).<br /><br /> So, what exactly does a doctor look like in America today? Let’s review some facts from a 2014 survey of physicians with an active license to practice medicine in the United States, conducted by the Federation of State Medical Boards, and a 2010 AAMC database:<br /><br />  66 percent of actively practicing physicians are males, and 32 percent are female (2 percent declined to answer).<br /><br />  Approximately 20 percent of actively practicing physicians are less than 40 years old, and approximately 11 percent are above 70 years old. The rest are somewhere in between.<br /><br />  75 percent of actively practicing physicians graduated medical school in the United States or Canada. In order, the five countries where most of our international medical school graduates come from are India, the Caribbean, the Philippines, Pakistan, and Mexico.<br /><br />  In 2008, 75 percent of U.S. physicians were white, 12.8 percent of physicians were Asian, 6.3 percent of physicians were black/African American, 5.5 percent were Hispanic/Latino, and 0.5 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native. Statistics on medical school demographics show that these numbers are actively changing, with the number of minority students on the rise.<br /><br /> Obviously, the diversity doesn’t stop there. Much like the demographics of the rest of our country, our physicians were raised in different socioeconomic backgrounds, practice different religions, have varying politics, live in both rural and urban settings, have different hobbies, and live different lifestyles. A New York Times Article cites that physicians are about 50/50 Democrats/Republicans overall.    From greatest to least, an article from the Journal of General Internal Medicine from 2005 states physician religious preferences to be Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Atheist/Agnostic, Hindu, Muslim, Orthodox, Mormon, Buddhist, and other.  From looking at my own physician colleagues, interests vary from surfboarding to baking.<br /><br /> My point is this: Don’t assume you know what a doctor looks like, especially in the outside world sans white coats and scrubs. In this situation, I’m not sure how you could reliably pick us out of a crowd without speaking to us. We are much more diverse in our appearances and personal lives than you may think. Just know that when it comes to matters related to patient care, we do have one thing in common – we have the patient’s best interest in mind, and we are trained to handle emergency medical situations. Please don’t turn down our help because we don’t look “doctor” enough to you.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Pexels/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

333	122	2	Why Are Female Physicians Scared To Be Women?	My question is this: Why haven’t these systems really evolved with them? It’s now been 167 years since Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to graduate with a medical degree in the United States. Nowadays, just shy of 50 percent of medical students are women. Yet we still struggle with issues like maternity leave, pumping at work, asking for days off when the kids are sick, and career advancement; only 15 percent of academic department chairs are women and only 22 percent of tenured professors are women.<br /><br /> Trust me, I take a lot of pride in what I do, and find it incredibly fulfilling. I feel really fortunate to have a job that I love and a wonderful patient base, and to have had great colleagues and mentors. I think we (female physicians) all do, or we wouldn’t put ourselves through things like taking call when 39.5 weeks pregnant or voluntarily staying late for an emergency add-on, even if it means missing our child’s first soccer game. Or pumping in the MRSA-ridden hospital bathrooms because we’re afraid to ask for our — ahem, legally mandatory — nursing rooms. So gross.<br /><br /> Somehow, though, in doing these things, we’ve set up a system where a male attending who rearranges his schedule to make his child’s school play is praised, while the pregnant female physician stresses about asking to come in an hour late so they can go to their OB appointment.<br /><br /> There are obviously lots of issues at play here, but at the heart of it, I think we as females have been too scared to assert ourselves as women because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1. We believe that we have to behave like a male to succeed. We’re not all built the same way, and have different strengths.  Are the male physicians trying to do everything we — on average — do better? (Studies have shown that we are more likely to follow evidence-based guidelines, score higher on care and quality, and tend to show more empathy and are perceived as better listeners.) Just as we use our other personal strengths to succeed, we should use those unique to our gender — like our ability to multitask.  While I know plenty of amazing male physicians, what percentage of them are performing as complex of a balancing act at home as the average female doc?<br /><br />2. We fear that any complaining will be perceived as laziness or being difficult. Somehow we think that a male physician can complain about anything and everything, and it’s even humorous and results in change, but we think that if we do it, it’ll be used against us and be the subject of conversation once we leave the team room.  Throw in the fact that by nature, we like to please people, and we’re a lot less likely to point out unfair treatment and push for that salary bump or new title.<br /><br />3. We think working part time or asking for altered schedules will make people think we don’t take our jobs seriously, and will contribute to our lack of professional success. These things can actually provide us with the energy we need to care for our patients and juggle all the multitasking more efficiently. Not to mention that happier physicians get better patient satisfaction scores, and physician retention/professional outcomes are far better when a female is given opportunities for a flexible or reduced work schedule.<br /><br />4. We feel like talking about things like pumping or our kids will either gross our male colleagues out or make them think medicine isn’t our first priority. But we bite our tongues when they tell their inappropriate stories all the time (yes, you all know what you’ve been forced to listen to). This is the reason med student and resident forums are littered with worried posts about how to deal with pumping during lengthy board exams. It’s 2016: This shouldn’t be the source of more stress than the exam itself.<br /><br />5. We seethe silently when patients and other hospital staff (including other physicians) don’t realize that we are physicians, but are afraid we’ll sound stuck up or catty if we address it. When was the last time you were referred to as a nurse or a social worker (and the male medical student with you was assumed to be the doctor)? I respect the professions I’ve been mistaken for; that’s not the issue. However, I do find the underlying sentiment behind assuming only males can be doctors to be indicative of a more serious problem, and we as females need to find (tactful) ways to reply.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, there is some truth in the consequences of doing these things. But there are enough of us to change that. Let’s not apologize for ourselves all the time, or be afraid to ask for what we need to make our lives work. This is not a call to arms or an attack on male physicians; they have their own attributes that make them invaluable to the system. Rather, it’s a plea for female physicians to recognize that we are smart, dedicated, and caring, and we also have a lot to contribute to our patients and our employers as women.<br /><br /> A change in culture requires women physicians to acknowledge that we are different from men and have different priorities — and to assert that these qualities contribute to the medical system instead of detract from them.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />daily sunny/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

334	122	2	Why You Should Care About Medical Student Debt	Many recent articles make the case for why becoming a physician is not actually a sound financial plan, highlighting decreases in physician salaries, the opportunity cost of the years in training, and the income ceiling relative to those in prominent other professional positions. Despite this, a reliable six-figure salary is not one to scoff at, and the public is hardly going to crusade against reimbursement cuts for physicians or rally for better physician pay the way that they (rightfully) do for teacher pay.<br /><br /> But there is a bigger reason why society should be concerned about the cost of a medical education. There are long-term consequences to a system where the average amount of debt for a graduating medical student is over $150,000. This number will almost inevitably rise, with medical school tuition steadily rising at approximately 3-4% a year for both private and public institutions. These numbers do not take into account the additional debt accrued by many during years of residency and fellowship, where an average salary of $55,300 (Medscape debt and salary report, 2014) may not adequately support the families of those training in large metropolitan areas.<br /><br /> What does this mean for our system?<br /><br /> 1. Potentially, fewer physicians in the system. The numbers have yet to support this argument, with medical school applications actually at all-time highs. However, particularly as physician salaries decline and the voicing of physician discontent/burnout rises, undertaking a large debt may be harder for aspiring physicians to swallow.<br /><br /> 2. Less diversity of the physicians who are in the system. More than half of U.S. medical students come from families in the top quintile for family income. This is a complex statistic reflecting far more than an ability to afford the education, but concerning in that students of lower socioeconomic status will have even more barriers to entry of qualified applicants into the field.<br /><br /> 3. A shift of physicians away from primary care positions towards specialized fields, which reimburse better, and can help physicians pay their loans back faster. In an era where policy is promoting primary care, and there is already a shortage of primary care providers, the dangers of this are obvious.<br /><br /> 4. A change in physician culture. Traditionally, people have entered medicine to make a difference in the lives of patients, and have seen the profession as a calling. As financial pressures increase, the need for physicians to consider the financial implications of their practice patterns and populations could lead to a further lack of access to care by underserved patient populations. The doctor-patient relationship will also suffer, as the need to generate a profit increases.<br /><br /> 5. Fewer physician scientists. The advancement of medicine as a field relies on the progress of science, which needs the perspective of physicians to guide research into clinically relevant directions. Much of this research arises from academic medical centers, where physicians, on the whole, make significantly less than their counterparts in private practice. Before making the argument that MD/PhD physicians are actually subsidized and don’t pay for medical school out of pocket, realize that only a minority of physicians who practice academic medicine and are on the clinical staff at academic medical centers are MD/PhDs Given the pay differential, as debt becomes more burdensome, physicians may be less inclined to take academic positions.<br /><br /> These are all reasons why the public should be concerned about medical student debt. It’s not about the physicians as individuals, but about the field we are striving to protect and further develop.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Zak Greant/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

335	122	2	10 Truths Of Physician Parents	2. You can’t go to any of your children’s activities or events without getting curb-sided, usually about somebody’s rash or poop. If you’re not a pediatrician, you will fumble through most of these questions, unless it happens to be your lucky day and the question is actually related to your subspecialty.<br /><br /> 3. You book family vacations based on when there’s CME offerings in your destination of choice. Interesting how your children believe that everyone has been to Disney or Atlantis, since they’ve been there five times already.<br /><br /> 4. Your child will often be the first kid dropped off at school or the last kid picked up from school — or both. The daycare teachers will drop not-so-subtle hints alluding to this (so they can go home earlier). Hey, when you signed up for before/after school care, you thought you were supposed to use it. Every. Single. Second.<br /><br /> 5. You will likely be told that you taught your child something age-inappropriate at some point. In second grade, I was assigned a show and tell on MIs since my dad was a cardiologist. When I started with, “I’m going to talk about myocardial infarctions,” the teacher interrupted to say I was supposed to talk about heart attacks. I replied, “Oh, that’s the lay people term.” My dad was called in for a parent-teacher conference a few days later.<br /><br /> 6. You adamantly try to prevent childhood obesity by providing your kids with well-balanced, healthy meals. Meanwhile you subsist on granola bars, coffee, and random snacks from the hospital nursing stations and PACU. Just one of many examples of medical hypocrisy your child will point out as they get older.<br /><br /> 7. Your children say no a little too quickly/emphatically when asked the question, “Do you want to be a doctor too?” You just hope it isn’t in front of your chairman. Shocking how the pager going off in the middle of the Super Bowl or always being late for dinner hasn’t attracted them to the field. Honestly, a part of you is relieved.<br /><br /> 8. Your children will be prohibited from doing normal things just because you happen to have seen an unfortunate case. I’m a radiologist, and my husband is a plastic surgeon. Things our kids can’t do: Jump on a trampoline, put their hands on the escalator rails at the mall, pet an unknown dog … the list goes on.<br /><br /> 9. You stock Dermabond in your house like it’s going out of style. If you’ve used it enough, one day you’ll walk into a room and see your older child putting Elmer’s glue onto the younger sibling’s cut.<br /><br /> 10. You have no concept of the fact that the above things are not normal.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Pexels/pixabay/CC0 <br />Article last time updated on 06.07.2017.

336	122	2	8 Tips From My Non-Medicine Friends That Make Me A Happier Doctor	1. Don’t take yourself so seriously. It’s true that at work we often deal with life or death situations. But that doesn’t need to translate into everything that we do.  Both at work or at home, it helps to be able to laugh at yourself. In fact, one of the best ways to create a connection with your patients and your colleagues is by showing your human side. Your resume and the certificates on your wall speak for themselves.<br /><br /><br /> 2. Admit what you don’t know. You lose a lot more credibility by making things up or fumbling through an explanation than just saying you’re not sure and that you’ll find out. Many patients are double checking what you say on the Internet before they’ve even left the office building. After years of exam after exam, we start to believe we have to know everything, forgetting that every profession has experts in particular areas of their field. Patients are okay with this.<br /><br /><br /> 3. Take a sick day if you’re really not feeling well. Believe it or not, our patients don’t want to get the latest daycare bug we’ve contracted it from our toddlers. Additionally, coming to see us requires time and money on their end – they don’t want us when we’re not at our best. You don’t want your contractor coming out to fix something at your house and doing 50 percent of the job and charging you full price. If somebody really can’t reschedule, see if one of your partners can fit them in.<br /><br /><br /> 4. More often than not, things can wait. In a world where “STAT” seems to be thrown around whether warranted or not, it’s easy to overemphasize the urgency in what you want done. Yes, the type A in all of us wants results as quickly as possible. But the stress involved in making sure that things happen at that speed is often not worth it. The next time you’re pushing hard for something to happen immediately, pause and consider whether it really needs to happen that second. If not, save the energy for when it actually does.<br /><br /><br /> 5. Self-care really is important. My non-medical friends are quick to point out when I don’t practice what I preach, and this comes up most often in relation to how I take care of myself. Ever notice how all of your friends who aren’t in medicine eat better than you, exercise more than you, and are usually less stressed out than you (even if they have more to be stressed out about)?<br /><br /><br /> 6. Sometimes, mediocrity is OK. What do you call the person who graduates last in your medical school class? None of my friends routinely ask their doctors where they went to medical school, how many publications they have, or what they hope to accomplish in five years. There are times where life is just about survival. Yes, try and do your best, but also cut yourself some slack.<br /><br /><br /> 7. Not everyone gets personal satisfaction out of their job. For many people, a job is just a job. While I know many physicians that don’t love their jobs for various reasons, I know very few that don’t get personal satisfaction from what they do. We are actually really lucky to have found something that we’re passionate about that provides this. It may not stop us from groaning when the pager goes off in the middle of the night, but that’s another story.<br /><br /><br /> 8. When you’re done with your education, enjoy your life. If you don’t want to work 80 hours a week, don’t. If you want to pursue another passion, you can. If you want more flexibility, ask for it. Yes, during training medicine can be all encompassing and the path is pretty outlined. But after you’re done, you have choices. Make the ones that make you happy.<br />  <br /><br /> Read more:<br /><br /> @nishamehtamd<br /><br />www.facebook.com/nishamehtamd<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Kenny Louie/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 08.11.2016.

337	123	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	623	m2m
338	125	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

339	125	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

340	125	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

341	126	2	What All Parents Should Know About IVs	By Heather Michon |<br /><br /><br /><br /> Caitlin King only got to hold her newborn twin girls for a few precious moments before they were whisked off to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). That’s where their journey began. Born at 32 weeks and six days, Abbie May and Gardner Grace weighed just four pounds each.<br /><br /> Caitlin describes the NICU as a whirlwind, filled with fragile little babies attended by a team of nurses. “[They were] the most amazing people I’ve ever experienced,” says Caitlin. “The NICU nurses were everything to us.”<br /><br /> She was awakened in the middle of the night by the news that the medical team was having a hard time finding good veins on the girls’ limbs. The nurse requested permission to insert intravenous (IV) lines into their bellybuttons.<br /><br /> The umbilical vein remains viable for about a week after birth and it is sometimes used to take blood samples. Umbilical vein catheterization (UVC) is recommended when good peripheral veins can’t be found, but it does carry risks. Some of the complications include a potential for infection, bleeding from the umbilical vein, and embolism.<br /><br /> Caitlin gave her consent, but was concerned for her daughters. “After the nurse left, I just lost it. I started crying and it just sounded so scary,” she admits.<br /><br /> The umbilical line worked for Gardner Grace, but not for twin sister Abbie May. Staff finally inserted the catheter into a vein in Abbie May’s scalp.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Scalp vein catheterization is even less common than a UVC and most consider it a last resort. In some ways, it’s an excellent location: there are several veins in a newborn’s skull that are easy to visualize and because a baby tends not to move their head the way they move their limbs, the catheter is less likely to be dislodged. Statistically, it seems to carry no greater risk than a line in the arm or the leg. However, it’s avoided when possible because it’s more upsetting for parents, especially since it often requires the area to be shaved and can leave a scar.<br /><br /><br />  Caitlin had previously worked on a project with a medical research company, giving her some familiarity with IVs.  “Every NICU nurse we had, I told them ‘I don’t know anything about medical stuff except IV infiltration. So you have to make sure that my kids’ IVs don’t infiltrate,’” she laughs.<br /><br />  One day, she looked at Abbie May’s scalp and thought the area around the catheter looked puffy–one of the primary signs of infiltration. She called the nurse over to check it, and the nurse agreed that she was also concerned when she looked at it. Examination showed the catheter had infiltrated and was leaking fluid into the surrounding tissue. It was quickly removed. After 15 days in the NICU, the newborns were discharged from the hospital and finally got to go home.<br /><br /><br /><br />  While Caitlin believes the nurse probably would have discovered the infiltration herself, she’s glad she was able to have an active role in her newborns’ care.<br /><br />  “I was pretty proud that I knew there was something wrong and was able to point out to the nurse that it didn’t look right.”<br /><br />  In a situation where she felt powerless, this was something she had done that helped her babies.<br /><br />  It was a boost of confidence in a stressful time. “If, as a parent, I can be aware and say ‘look, I think something’s wrong here,’ and bring attention to something a doctor or nurse may be missing–because they’re human and sometimes we miss things–then I’ll do it.”<br /><br /><br /><br />  Now the mom of two healthy, active three-year-olds, Caitlin hopes other parents take from her experience the importance of educating themselves when it comes to kids and IVs. “There’s no awareness about IVs, it’s not talked about, and yet it happens every day,” she says. “As a parent, feeling helpless is one of the worst feelings in the world. If there’s something you can do when it comes to knowing what to look for, do it.”<br /><br />  Do you have an IV story to share? Tell us about it here.<br /><br /><br />  <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Photo courtesy of Caitlin King <br />Article last time updated on 08.02.2018.	Jasmine Williams	2018-02-08 00:00:00	85	m2m
342	126	2	IV Complications: What Can Go Wrong?	https://www.myiv.com/iv-complications/<br /><br /> By: Ryan MacArthur <br /><br />Full story:<br /><br /> The use of intravenous (IV) therapy is more common than ever. While it’s an extremely valuable tool for healthcare professionals, patients and providers must know and understand the risks associated with IV therapy.<br /><br /> Infiltrations<br /><br /> The delivery of fluid and/or medication outside the vein and into the surrounding soft tissue. An infiltration can occur for a number of reasons, such as leakage from the insertion site or catheter dislodgement. Patients will see swelling of the soft tissue surrounding the IV, and the skin will feel cool, firm, and pale. Small amounts of IV fluid aren’t typically life-threatening but some medications, even in small doses, can be very toxic to the surrounding soft tissue.<br /><br /> Extravasations<br /><br /> The infiltration of a blistering agent (also known as a vesicant) into the surrounding IV site as the result of leakage from a vein. Vesicants can cause tissue destruction and result in pain at the IV site and along the vein. Because chemotherapy medications are highly toxic, extravasation is especially dangerous.<br /><br /> Hematoma<br /><br /> The leakage of blood from the vein into the surrounding soft tissue. This can occur when an IV angiocatheter goes through more than one wall of a vein or if pressure is not applied to the IV site when the catheter is removed.<br /><br /> Phlebitis and Thrombophlebitis<br /><br /> Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein, while thrombophlebitis refers to inflammation associated with a blood clot within the vascular system. Both are more common on the backside of the hand than on the upper part of the elbow and may occur in hospitalized patients where an IV has been in place for several days.<br /><br /> Air Embolism<br /><br /> A result of a large volume of air entering the patient’s vein via the IV. When an air bubble enters a vein or artery, it can cause life-threatening blockages. In order to prevent air bubbles from forming, clinicians will keep the IV bag from moving and ensure it is it remains hanging vertically.<br /><br /><br />  References:<br /><br />   Everything you need to know about air bubbles in your patient’s IV line https://thenursepath.blog/2016/12/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-air-bubbles-in-your-patients-iv-line/<br /><br />   Know the Difference Between Infiltration vs. Extravasation https://www.rn.com/nursing-news/know-the-difference-infiltration-vs-extravasation/<br /><br />   Air Embolism http://www.healthline.com/health/air-embolism#overview1<br /><br />   Medical Emergencies and Complications http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/aegd/mod01_mec_ivcomp.html<br /><br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 16.01.2018.

343	127	2	Emotional Effect on Women That Have an Abortion	In general, we find that abortion is very stressful for women. It is not easy when they decide to terminate a pregnancy. First of all, falling pregnant can already be stressful, especially if it comes with certain medical problems, when it’s unwanted, or even in rape cases.<br /><br /> Furthermore, we find that directly after a woman has had an abortion, she might experience unexpected emotions and reactions. Sometimes it’s also difficult to discuss it due to religious and cultural reasons. Many women might feel emotional distress and guilt caused by religious beliefs that normally creates a stigma concerning abortions.<br /><br /> However, most emotional and psychological responses related to an abortion is normal. Yet, it shouldn’t be severe or persistent enough to affect their daily lifestyle, it typically fades on its own.<br /><br />Some of these feelings naturally can include the following:<br /><br /> Loss of her self-esteem<br /><br /> Stress that can reduce her ability to cope<br /><br /> Regret or remorse<br /><br /> Guilt<br /><br /> Grief due to the sense of loss<br /><br /> Relief or anxiety<br /><br /> Not every woman will experience emotional responses that are negative with an abortion. Those that do shouldn’t have problems concerning their mental health that is lasting. Some might react positive and feel relief without any regrets. This is because they feel confident that their decision was a choice that is right for them. <br /><br /> About depression<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a mental or psychological condition of your health, also known as a mood disorder.<br /><br /> Some symptoms and signs you might experience when you are depressed can include:<br /><br /> Sleep patterns that are disturbed<br /><br /> Losing interest in any activities you used to enjoy<br /><br /> Lose your interest in having intercourse<br /><br /> Tiredness or lack of energy<br /><br /> Irritable feelings<br /><br /> Feeling guilty<br /><br /> Concentration that is poor, plus finds it difficult to make decisions<br /><br /> Your ability to think can be reduced<br /><br /> Experiencing sadness or feeling low<br /><br /> Depression can develop at various severity levels. Women that have a mild condition will be able to perform her activities daily with some ease. However, when depression is severe it can affect her life so dramatically that she won’t be able to work. It may also cause other mental issues that are more serious, like psychosis.<br /><br /> Feelings of self-harm or suicide are symptoms that are very serious and they will need help urgently. Depression may not be a reason for physical changes but sometimes depressed patients can talk very slowly. It might also have other effects such as loss of appetite which could cause loss of weight and even anorexia or bulimia.<br /><br /> Grief or depression due to an abortion<br /><br /> Grief is a reaction that is naturally occurring with the death of a loved one, but it shouldn’t cause depression over a long term.<br /><br /> To experience loss after termination of an unplanned pregnancy can also be natural, like due to an injury or illness. Yet, in this case, because of a spontaneous abortion, the symptoms might not last very long.<br /><br /> Most of the time, even if a woman decides on an abortion to terminate a pregnancy, she will still experience feelings that are natural of regret, guilt, grief, sadness, and loss afterward.<br /><br /> Risk factors for depression<br /><br /> Women with mental disorders prior to unwanted pregnancies who goes for an abortion can experience it differently as what healthy women would. They might be at a higher risk to develop depression after the procedure.<br /><br />These risk factors may include:<br /><br /> If they previously had childbirth that was unwanted<br /><br /> In the case of alcohol or drug use<br /><br /> A history of emotional or violence problems<br /><br /> With poverty<br /><br /> Genetics can also be linked to a very high risk of developing depression after an abortion. This means if any of their relatives also experienced depression as an illness factor, it will be more likely for a woman to experience it herself.<br /><br /> Specific events in life may trigger depressive episodes. These include such as rape or physical abuse and it can trigger depression that is severe after an abortion as it may cause a feeling of loss and separation.<br /><br /> It’s important for any woman making the choice to go for an abortion, no matter what the reason might be, to consult a professional for help before and after the procedure. Doctors have the experience to help you understand what you can expect during the abortion and afterward. and may recommend sessions with professional staff to help you through this emotional time.<br />Article last time updated on 01.01.2018.

344	127	2	Home Remedies to Help with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease	Pelvic inflammatory disease or PID for short is a sort of infection that affects a female’s reproductive organs. Most woman may get this disease through sexual activities. When transmitted bacteria enters a woman’s vagina it could spread to the ovaries, fallopian, or even the uterus. This virus can cause havoc to a woman’s reproductive system.<br /><br /> There are quite a few different bacteria types that may cause PID but the most common are sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, some surgical procedure may also cause PID such as an abortion. There are many factors that will increase your risk of getting PID.<br /><br /> Some common factor is such as when a woman has more than one sexual partner, having unprotected intercourse, a history of sexually transmitted diseases, or regular douching.<br /><br /> There are many women that may have or get PID but shows no symptoms or signs of it. The woman that do get symptoms and signs may experience back pain, pain during intercourse, pain while urinating, fever, general exhaustion, a loss of appetite, pelvic pain, vaginal discharge with an odor, lower abdominal pain, or irregular menstrual bleeding.<br /><br /> PID can leave a scar on the fallopian tubes and may cause infertility if not treated in time. You will need to see a doctor for PID as the home remedies can only be used as an assisted treatment. However, there are also other diseases that may have similar symptoms according to the doctors at Forest Hills Medical Services NY.<br /><br /> Here is a look at some of the home remedies one can use in conjunction with PID treatment.<br /><br /> Home remedies<br /><br />Garlic<br /><br /><br /><br /> Garlic has very strong antibiotic and antibacterial properties. Thus, it is good for treating PID. There are several different compounds found in garlic that will destroy harmful bacteria caused by PID. Garlic also helps to regulate good vaginal bacteria and may prevent any recurrence of infections.<br /><br /> •    You can take 2 to 3 garlic cloves that are minced. Add these to a pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and fry until your garlic turns a brown color. Once done, you may strain the oil and wait for it to cool down.<br /><br /> When the oil you removed is cold use a cotton ball to soak in the oil. Place the oily cotton ball in the vagina for a couple of seconds. You are basically only applying the oil with the cotton ball. Wait about 2 to 3 hours before you rinse or wash. You may do this daily until the infection is gone completely.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    You should also ensure your intake of garlic is a lot more than normal. This can be achieved by adding garlic to most of your meals, or by taking a garlic supplement.<br /><br />Baking Soda<br /><br /><br /><br /> Wow, again! Will you believe me if a say that this is the most magical product that there is? This product helps with an unbelievable amount of things.<br /><br /> Baking soda is a very effective treatment for PID. What is so awesome about baking soda is that it has alkaline compounds which can reduce acidity. Another benefit is that baking soda will also help balance your bodies PH level.<br /><br /> 1. Add ½ a teaspoon baking soda to a glass of water.<br /><br /> 2. Then add 1 teaspoon of psyllium fiber to the water and stir.<br /><br /> 3. You should drink this only once a week on an empty stomach.<br /><br />Pelvic Massage<br /><br /><br /><br /> Massages help with many different conditions and health issues. A lower abdominal and pelvic message will help with PID. It assists by increasing blood flow (of the reproductive organs) and tightening the muscles. This will ease your pain and will give you relaxation while also speeding up the healing process.<br /><br /> 1.

Start massaging your lower abdomen and pelvic area in circular motions. You must do this for about 5 to 10 minutes and 1 to 2 times a day until the symptoms diminish.<br /><br /> Please just remember that you must first go and see your doctor before doing any of these or other things.<br />Article last time updated on 23.11.2017.

345	127	2	Treatments Used in Dental Habit Therapy That Can Help Your Child	It’s possible for anyone to develop bad habits during their life. In some cases, young children may have bad habits that could actually influence the function and development of their mouth, teeth, and jaws. Examples of this can be thumb sucking, mouth breathing, and tongue thrusting that are persistent.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The reflex of sucking can be a natural occurrence among children at an early age, which normally disappears between the ages of two and four years. However, if the problem persists after four years, the pressure on their upper jaw and front teeth may cause teeth to start moving apart. Plus, it can result in the jaw changing its shape. This conditions might impair their speech and also cause an open bite problem.<br /><br /> With mouth breathing, which relates to a pattern of breathing that is not normal, causing their mouths to remain always open. This can pass direct air into the lungs, and cause muscular alteration functions of their face and tongue. The lower and upper jaw may abnormally grow and cause orthodontic conditions that can be serious.<br /><br /> Some issues that will need habit therapy among children<br /><br /> Two issues that are known to be the biggest problem in children concerning bad habits can include finger or thumb sucking, plus tongue thrusting. The thrusting of the tongue can occur if a child pushes his/her tongue forward onto the teeth constantly. Most of the time they will outgrow such a habit at around four years old. Although, if it doesn’t happen, it may cause their teeth to misalign.<br /><br /> Side effects from misalignment might seriously affect how a child’s face looks. It’s important that you consult a professional dentist for correcting the problems since the child at such a young age won’t understand any of the consequences.<br /><br /> Thumb sucking treatment using orthodontic appliances<br /><br /><br /><br /> When your child persistently sucks his/her thumb, consider getting orthodontic treatment early for stopping this behavior, as well as preventing problems from developing. It’s important to help the child understand what problems can be associated with this habit and suggest different ways to stop it.<br /><br /> Different ways to try and stop the habit may include reminding them about the dangers of the habit. Additionally, at night time place a hand puppet, sock or mitten over the hand. Furthermore, consider using an elbow elastic support that might make it difficult for bending his/her elbow to prevent thumb sucking. Sometimes, these habits are an emotional comfort device and scolding can only worsen the situation.<br /><br /> However, when it doesn’t help, your dentist may suggest an orthodontic appliance, known as a tongue crib which painlessly and gently will stop thumb sucking completely. This treatment can physically prevent the habit and typically, your child’s habit should be over within a couple of months if wearing this appliance.<br /><br /> Treatment appliances for tongue thrusting<br /><br /> This habit happens when your child pushes his or her tongue against the teeth in front while they are swallowing or speaking. A parent might feel it’s not a big issue, though, as time goes by the pressure that is exerted through their tongue onto the teeth may relate to orthodontic open bite problems.<br /><br /> An appliance for tongue thrusting will correct such behavior and prevent the child from thrusting his/her tongue against the teeth. Thus, it can allow the teeth to develop as it should.<br /><br /> This appliance can be placed in a comfortable and safe way to correct the child’s habit. It’s a semi-permanent attachment to the teeth very similar to the way braces are fitted. For the duration it is worn, it will guide the child to correct his/her patterns of behavior. Sometimes it might also be recommended for a child to get a speech or exercise therapy together with such a dental appliance.<br /><br /> Sometimes success can be reached after only a couple of days. All the same, the time it takes doesn’t really matter because once the orthodontist can confirm your child is over the habit, they will remove the appliance. It’s very similar to a palatal crib which may typically be used for preventing a child to suck his/her thumb, it only differs from what this crib actually blocks.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.

346	127	2	What Platelet Lysate Treatments Do	Normally Platelets found in the body releases in a slow manner some growth factors to promote healing. Granting, at times the doctor might need to contain these growth factors within platelets so that it’s immediately accessible for promoting healing faster. This is used in areas that are affected by disease or damage.<br /><br /> However, in certain areas of your body where doctors use PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, it might cause a lot of inflammation. Therefore, they prefer to create a Platelet Lysate solution. This is done by cracking the Platelets open and allowing all growth factors to promptly be released into your body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> It’s a purely concentrated solution of the growth factors found in plasma once platelets were removed and activated. This regenerative solution that doctor’s use has minimal inflammatory reactions and it’s immediately very active. It’s a preferred solution to treat areas of injured nerves, new stem cells, and in your epidural space.<br /><br /> How effective is therapy with Platelet Lysate?<br /><br /> This procedure can provide relief for a variety of conditions, although, it may vary in effectiveness. It helps the body to do what comes naturally, yet, because every patient’s healing process is different, it will reflect those results. This means that some patients might only need a single treatment, where others will require additional treatments.<br /><br /> Additionally, the reaction may depend on the following factors.<br /><br /> Different conditions or health factors that may attribute to slow healing<br /><br /> Activities after the treatment<br /><br /> Your overall health condition<br /><br /> Response and status of your immune system<br /><br /> Degrees of the damage<br /><br /> The specific area that is damaged<br /><br /> A patient’s age<br /><br /> Advantages of this therapy<br /><br /> There are many advantages with such an innovative therapy which can outweigh problems commonly related to different treatments like steroid injections or surgeries.<br /><br /> Advantages of Platelet Lysate therapy may include the following:<br /><br /> It’s related to healing over the long-term<br /><br /> Easy to perform and prepare<br /><br /> Less inflammatory effects<br /><br /> Recovery periods can be short<br /><br /> Natural cell regeneration<br /><br /> Using a person’s own power of healing<br /><br /> Non-invasive procedure<br /><br /> Such a procedure speeds up the process of natural healing due to the fact that growth factors can be available immediately to tissues that are damaged. It will be directly injected into the area that is damaged, immediately starting the process of healing.<br /><br /> It’s possible to apply Platelet Lysate treatment therapy any number of times. This will depend on what your body may need. When experiencing great improvement its fine to slow down or even stop treatments. On the other hand, when the body is in need of extra support, there won’t be a problem to carry on with the treatment.<br /><br /><br /><br /> About advanced PRP and Platelet Lysate procedures<br /><br /> Treatments with injections of PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma, as well as Platelet Lysate contains components of healing and growths that is collected from a person’s own blood. This is used to increase the body’s ability of naturally repairing itself.<br /><br /> These procedures can be used to repair muscle, ligament, tendon, and joint injuries. Thus, it has become very popular among professional athletes. The injections are very effective due to the fact that it stimulates stem cells in the area that is targeted. It promotes those cells to work harder on tissue that is damaged for quicker healing. It is generally used for conditions of the spine, injuries of soft tissues, and mild arthritis.<br /><br /> The procedure of Platelet Lysate therapy<br /><br /> This procedure has less pain and fewer complications than what surgery offers. The doctor will discuss your condition and how the therapy can help you. Together a decision might be made whether it may be right for you.<br /><br /> It’s a fairly simple procedure and the following steps can be done:<br /><br /> To re-inject a mixture of Platelet Lysate into tissues that are damaged, cells are removed from a person’s own blood.<br /><br /> A tiny sample of the blood gets collected to separate platelets out of other components of the blood in order to create PRP/Platelet Rich Plasma.<br /><br /> This will then be subjected to a couple of series of freezing and thawing cycles. This carefully breaks the platelets apart to release its growth factors.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The Platelet Lysate results can then be combined together with just a tiny quantity of some anti-inflammatory medication such as Dexamethasone prior to being injected. Once done, it is injected into the area that is damaged using fluoroscopy or ultrasound which is guided techniques.<br /><br /> Once the procedure is done, you need to plan for enough rest, plus restricting activities for at least forty-eight hours. It might take some time before you will realize that the treatment is working. But once your activities or movements increases and you experience less pain you will know. You can decrease or increase treatments depending on how you feel.<br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-10 00:00:00	349	m2m
347	127	2	Can Perineal Massage Help You Avoid the Episiotomy?	Labor is a very painful and intense ordeal. The duration of this experience depends a lot on the strength of the contractions, the size of the baby, and the anatomy of the birth canal. The perineum is the area of the body between the anus and the vulva. You should rub or knead the muscles in order to relieve muscle tension. Perineal massage consists in rubbing or kneading the perineal muscles of a pregnant woman in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to allow these muscles and the surrounding tissue of the birth canal to stretch and relax prior delivery so an episiotomy can be avoided. When the canal birth is too narrow and when the baby is putting too much pressure on this area during childbirth, an episiotomy is required. An episiotomy is a cutting of the muscular area, commonly known as the perineum in order to help enlarge the vaginal opening during childbirth.<br /><br /> This area is exactly located between the vagina and the anus. It is normally done when the perineum is too rigid and too tight to allow a normal and easy delivery. It is also done to prevent tearing of the perineal wall as the baby tries to pass through the birth canal. It is also performed in order to allow a fast delivery of the baby. An episiotomy is seen as a necessary evil because, despite the practical reasons for doing it, it leads to some extra pain and discomfort after birth.<br /><br /> This can last up to a couple of days or a couple of weeks. It also changes the structure of the perineum permanently, as most of the muscles get replaced by a scar tissue. To reduce the possibility of an episiotomy, or a perineal tear, several practices have been tried over the years, and perineal massage is one of those. Perineal massage has a long and rich history, with the Chukchi Eskimos in Siberia using glass bottles and African tribes using gourds.<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is in order to increase the size of the vaginal canal and to increase the elasticity of the perineal area. The beautiful thing about a perineal massage is that it is relatively easy to perform. It does not require any special equipment, and you or your partner can do it in the absence of any medical professional. The massage is preferably done after taking a bath. You will need to take a comfortable position, wash your hands and lubricate your thumb with a water-based lubricant.<br /><br /> You can choose natural lubricants like olive oil or almond oil if you prefer. Once the hands are cleaned and lubricated, you need to place the thumb inside the vagina. The thumb should be inserted until the first knuckle of it is at the same level with the mouth of the vagina. This means that about 1-1.5 inches of your thumb would be inserted into the vagina. With the thumbs still in the vagina, push downwards towards the direction of the anus, and outwards towards the sides.<br /><br /> Keep pushing till you feel a burning and a stretching sensation. Hold your thumbs in place at this point for a minute or two. After that move your thumbs in around the lower half of the vagina by moving in a “U” shape from side to side for about 10 minutes. That way you will massage the side walls and the base of the vagina as well. Like massages on every other part of the body, it is not a one-time procedure, but should be done repeatedly.<br /><br /> Some experts recommend 6-10 sessions starting from 4-6 weeks before expected due date and continuing until the child is born. Interestingly, the upper half of the vagina does not need to be massaged, as it is surrounded by bones. The urethra is also found in this area, and any attempt to massage it may lead to some level of discomfort and even urinary tract infections.<br /><br /> You will want to avoid the upper half of the vagina during the perineal massage as you won’t have any profit from it. Women have reported an increase in the width of their birth canal with each session of perineal massage. Certain researchers have also been conducted in order to show the effectiveness of the perineal massage in preventing perineal tears and episiotomy during delivery.<br /><br /> One of such research's in the UK noted that there was a 6.1% reduction in second and third - degree tears. And there were episiotomies in women who did perineal massage during the last month of their pregnancy. The effects were higher in women over the age of 30 years old who were having their first baby. This is probably because of the fact that older women normally have a more rigid perineum compared to women at their 20’s.<br /><br /> The perineal massage helps widen the birth canal and make its walls more elastic and less likely to tear. In younger women who were having their first babies, the effect on their still elastic perineum is minimal. For women who have had previous episiotomies and women who had perineal tears in their previous pregnancies, perineal massage does not have much effect. This is due to the fact that the scar tissue is already formed by the previous damage to the perineum.<br /><br /> Normally, this scar tissue is not that strong as the muscle is. Therefore, despite the massage, there is a minimal change in the width of their birth canal. However, these women can still need an episiotomy during the childbirth. Despite the effectiveness of the perineal massage, there are some people who it is not recommended for. These include women who have had preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes in the past, or currently have a vaginal infection.<br /><br /> It is also wise to stop perineal massage if it causes discomfort or stimulates contraction. Whether or not you decide to try the perineal massage, it is very important that you keep your appointments with your obstetrician. No amount of personal research can replace the competence of a skilled physician.<br /><br /><br />Article last time updated on 05.12.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-11-01 00:00:00	379	m2m
348	127	2	Why Would Couples Choose a Procedure for Gender Selection?	Most couples would like to have children of both sexes, especially in our current way of life where more and more people prefer smaller families. This is due to the fact that everything is so expensive. With today technology it’s possible for doctors through fertility treatments that are more advanced, to identify female and male embryos.<br /><br /> This option is available to couples today. In addition, couples can now also avoid passing on genetic sex-linked disorders to their children. The same goes for parents that want to balance their family and already have a child or children of one sex. Choosing a child’s gender has been subjected to a variety of debates quite extensively due to ART/assisted reproductive technology since it started.<br /><br /><br /><br /> I was very lucky through the conventional way to have two children and one of each gender. Yet, many couples might try for conceiving a boy or a girl and don’t see success until maybe the fifth time. By selecting your baby’s gender which is also called family balancing, it’s possible to have both sexes and keep the family smaller. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> In certain countries, this procedure might only be permitted for preventing transmission of genetic sex-linked diseases. Although, in others, it can be a practice that is common in fertility clinics.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> During development of an embryo, the differentiation of gender may occur prior to fertilization. It’s usually determined by the contribution of genetic material of a father’s sperm because he carries an X and Y chromosome which is responsible for a baby’s gender. Women’s egg cells carry only the X chromosome which means the combination can either be XX for a girl and XY for a boy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to this factor, selecting a gender may involve manipulation during an early stage of embryonic development or fertilization. Techniques of assisted reproduction can allow couples in choosing their baby’s gender during these specific stages.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Stages may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br />Before you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This involves a procedure to choose a sperm for a couple’s desired gender prior to fertilization and allow the fertility doctor to perform it without using IVF. <br /><br />  <br /><br />After you conceive<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The doctor selects an embryo for the gender that is desired directly after it’s fertilized and then transfers the embryo back into the uterus of the mother.<br /><br />  <br /><br />While a woman is pregnant<br /><br /><br /><br /> In this case, a woman can voluntarily terminate her pregnancy, if the baby is not the gender they desire, which is called sex-selective abortion.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Due to reasons that are ethical, this type of abortion won’t be a recommended technique in choosing an unborn baby’s gender. Although, woman have the option to choose a VTOP/voluntary termination of pregnancy, which will purely depend on their choice.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Couples that choose a procedure to select the gender of their new baby will very often have opinions like these listed below.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Some couples believe if they have lost a child they can choose gender. Choosing a gender that is the same for their new baby won’t replace the one they have lost, but it might help them to work through the loss.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s been suggested that when a parent receives the gender of their choice, they can love the child more, but that is not really relevant to everyone.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This procedure may help in preventing any gender-related diseases of being transmitted to the new baby, which can benefit the child and the parent.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> New parents that plan for balancing their family with fewer children in this economy, might prefer selecting their children as it will be easier to provide them with what they need.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> For a part of the community that doesn’t believe in choosing your child’s gender, it can raise the following points as listed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> They feel it’s not really necessary and very expensive, as well as the fact that it won’t increase the likelihood to fall pregnant.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It’s not always a hundred percent accurate except when the chosen technique is IVF together with PGD to select the gender, but it’s the option that is most expensive.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Most couples prefer to guess their baby’s gender while pregnant. Thus, by choosing the gender up front, it can eliminate the surprise element. However, a couple that wants a boy and a girl, who after four tries, just have either boys or girls, won’t agree with a guessing game.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Sometimes others might say it may contribute to inequality of gender and cause an imbalance.<br />Article last time updated on 04.12.2017.

349	127	2	How Can Osseous Surgery Benefit You	Generally, to live a healthy life, your oral health plays an important role. A mouth that is clean is not just necessary for appearance and to eat with comfort, but it also will reduce the risk to develop infection and disease. With any periodontal disease, bacteria within the mouth may easily be carried into different areas of the body.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You should consult your dentist for assistance in regards to reclaiming your oral hygiene. Thus, keeping it at a level that is high. It’s important to fill cavities, plus remove any teeth that can’t be repaired. To do so, you also might need treatments like osseous surgery to reach your goal. In order to undergo this specific procedure, it’s necessary to understand what it entitles, as well as the benefits and risks.<br /><br /> About osseous surgery and the reason for doing it<br /><br /> People that suffer from a periodontal disease will be at risk that their teeth, gums, and bone can be destroyed. This disease causes pockets to form around teeth, which is very common and it can spread to other teeth as well. Additionally, it can develop into a breeding ground that increases infections throughout the body. With a mouth that is healthy, gums fit snugly against the teeth to prevent bacteria and food of reaching the area below the gum line.<br /><br /> In the beginning of this condition, it is easier to remove debris from problem areas, but as time goes by, treatment may be difficult, or sometimes even impossible to correct. The dentist will be able to clean the pockets through a reduction surgery for pocket depth’s and prevent further damage along with any infections. It can help you to keep a healthy and cleaner mouth, provided that you maintain good routines of oral health and go for dental cleanings regularly.<br /><br /> The main aim of osseous surgery is to remove all bacteria and debris from your pockets. Gum tissue will be folded back to expose the area around your tooth to clean it. If the tissue of your bone is also damaged, the dentist can smooth it as well. Bacteria can grow and hide even in the smallest of irregularities of your bone. This procedure can allow the tissue of the gum to reattach to the bone that is healthy more effectively.<br /><br /> Afterwards, your dentist can remove some extra tissue of the gum and use tiny stitches to keep your gum in its place to allow for natural healing. Sometimes, they might use a special kind of bandage for dentals.<br /><br /> It’s possible to experience swelling after your surgery, therefore you should apply on the outside an ice pack covering the area that is treated. This will help to reduce any discomfort. Your dentist might also prescribe antibiotics for prior, during, as well as after you have had your treatment.<br /><br /> Some risks factors<br /><br /> The same as any other surgical procedure, osseous surgery can also have risks. Even if you take proper care of your mouth, there might be a chance of infection to develop within the area. Although, by keeping up good oral care and if aftercare is performed properly, it may minimize your risk.<br /><br /> Additionally, gum tissue around your teeth that are treated can recede faster than the rest of the gums. This can cause your treated teeth to look as if they are longer than what the other teeth are. However, when this happens your dentist will be able to treat it.<br /><br /> Different risks might include sensitivities that can increase towards temperatures. It may be necessary to drink beverages that are cold through a straw and to avoid chewing foods that are very hot with your treated teeth. Because these teeth may be at a higher risk for cavities that is root-based, it’s very important to maintain oral care at a level that is high. <br /><br /> Benefits of this surgery<br /><br /> Recovery is easy and fast<br /><br /> Prevent future bacteria buildup<br /><br /> It can smooth a service that is irregular<br /><br /> Damage can be prevented<br /><br /> Attacking all bacteria<br /><br /> Pocket depth can be reduced<br /><br /> Your gums and teeth should fit together snugly in order to protect teeth from every type of infection.

350	127	2	And So Our Holiday Truly Starts	My heart starts to race excitedly and the plane starts it's decent. We are here, finally, we are here. It has felt like an eternity before our ocean holiday eventually started.<br /><br /> When my husband and myself got married, we procured some holiday points. It helps a lot as all the places to go to on holiday is sooo expensive.<br /><br /> So, since then we have had a tradition to save up our points for 3 years and then go on one nice long holiday. And here we are again. The ocean is calling, beckoning us to its shores with 3 kids in tow now.<br /><br /> Before our trip, we made a turn at our doctor to ensure the area where we were going was safe. We asked about injections for malaria and other viruses that may be present in the area. Once everything was medically done and safe we were on our way.<br /><br />Renting a car, first things first. <br /><br /> After getting our luggage we all followed Papa bear to the car rental service at the airport. While walking, the kids are having an argument about what color the car should be. Child no 1 wants a Pink car, really, can’t see that one happening, no 2 wants a blue car and no 3, well, she’s just looking at them as if a ball is being passed.<br /><br /> Papa bear winks at me when we get to the front desk of the rental car company, then he puts on an extremely serious face as he continues to ask – “Hi, there, please sir, my daughter wants a pink car, any in stock?”<br /><br /> I feel a giggle rising up at the pit of my stomach but manage to keep a straight face. No 1 is looking with so much expectation at the rental guy that I’m sure his squirming under the intensity of her stare.<br /><br /> To Mr rentals credit, he smiles and very seriously replies – “I am so sorry sir, the last pink chariot has left the building prior to your arrival.” No 1’s face drops with disappointment. Papa bear turns and says “So sorry honey bun, no pink ones. Maybe next time.”<br /><br /> “So, what do you have in blue?” Mr rental guy smiles and starts to tell us all our options. We ended up deciding between 3.<br /><br /> Chrysler town got an immediate no from papa bear. I knew why he’s itching to test drive either the Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape. So, when the Rental guy did not mention either of those in blue, I knew it was coming.<br /><br /> “Do you have either Nissan Frontier or Ford Escape?”<br /><br /> I could see the pent-up excitement on his face. When Mr. Rental guy confirmed that they do in fact have a 2016 Ford Escape in red, I could see papa bear jumping up and down on the inside.<br /><br /> “So kids, what about a red car?” They were easily persuaded and Papa bear was ecstatic. I did not dare touch him due to fear of being shocked. Seriously, if I looked closer, I was sure I could see tiny static running all over his being.<br /><br />Here we go<br /><br /> The bonus of flying is that there is not so much luggage. Thus, the luggage fitted in the Escape without any difficulty.<br /><br /> The nice thing about renting a car is that you get to properly test drive a car, in our case for two weeks. Papa bear was like a little boy as he was cruising down the highway. He was explaining to me about the 1.6L engine that delivers 178hp at 5700rpm. Additionally, the base model is front wheel drive and the one we are currently driving is an all-wheel-drive model. It also features a 15.5-gallon gas tank and delivers a fuel consumption of 22/29mpg.<br /><br /> He was carrying on like a dedicated car salesman. I smiled and made an hmm sound while I smiled and nodded at all the appropriate spaces. I knew this big boy was just like a little boy with a new toy. As they say right, boys and their toys…<br /><br />Meeting the local seagulls<br /><br /> We went to a nice little roadhouse next to the beach for some lunch. We got our order and parked the Escape so that we were overlooking the ocean. We sat outside on the rocks. Such a nice view as the waves broke and the wind gently sprayed us with ocean mist.<br /><br /> No 2 was holding a fry out of the window as he stared across the ocean when suddenly something grabbed the fry out of his hand. He screamed like a little girl! <br /><br /> A seagull took advantage of the hypnotic effect of the ocean and before we knew it we were surrounded by fry-stealing seagulls coming from who knows where.<br /><br /> Suddenly, we knew what it felt like to be surrounded.<br /><br /> The kids freely gave up the last of their fries in fear of seagull stares going mafia on us or being bitten. This, we took as our queue to get moving again.<br /><br />The Escape<br /><br /> The rest of our trip ran smoothly even though we had two nights of extreme mozzy (miskito, the insect kind) attacks, we knew all was fine. Everyone had their injections and no viruses were going to make us ill.<br /><br /> We enjoyed BBQ’s in the sunset overlooking the ocean and playing in the sand. We even got the opportunity to see some crabs and dolphins.<br /><br /> The thing I loved about the Escape, the SUV, is the large back seat, the kids had a ball, with plenty of space for themselves. The front seemed a bit smaller than with other SUV’s I’ve seen but the backseat and the luggage space makes up for it.<br /><br /> Some other small things that also made me like the Escape was the cruise control, backup camera and illuminating vanity mirrors. But the best is the overhead storage compartment, I could really get used to those. I can start to see why Papa Bear had his eye on the Escape. I just wonder does it come in pink?<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br /> The trip was amazing, we loved the Ford Escape and the escape from our busy lives’. The calming effect of the oceans draw refreshed us and we gained new strength to face our lives back home again. We were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br /><br /> How awesome was the fact that we need not drive all those miles back home. We got on an airplane with the refreshing effects of a 2-week ocean holiday still lingering all around us even as we got back home. On top of it all, we were protected by our doctor, thus, we did not bring any bacteria home either.<br />Article last time updated on 12.10.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-10-01 00:00:00	247	m2m
351	127	2	Everything You Should Know About a YAG Capsulotomy Procedure	Yttrium Aluminum Garnet also called YAG, is a procedure that produces infra-red laser light impulses. It is used to create small openings within tissue that are targeted through a process known as photo-disruption. Generally, it’s used for treating the iris and secondary cataracts. Sometimes doctors might also use it in treating problems with the retina at the eye’s back.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Indications<br /><br /> There is a variety of eye conditions treatable with this procedure. Conditions of the eyes that can be treated with a YAG capsulotomy procedure may include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    If there are vision interferences with activities during the day.<br /><br /> •    When vision in patients decreases that have multifocal intraocular lenses that might specifically be sensitive to even tiny changes of the posterior capsular.<br /><br /> •    Increased glaring.<br /><br /> •    Difficulty to visualize the fundus.<br /><br /> •    With Z syndrome and lens tilting that is related to hinge compliant lenses, like the Trulign toric and Crystalens lenses. Z syndrome may occur if one hap tic arched posterior and the other anterior, and lens tilting can occur if one hap tic is arched either posterior or anterior and the other is planar.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In some cases, it’s possible for a tiny anterior capsular contraction, capsulorrhexis or capsular phimosis may occur. With such excessive anterior scarring to your intra-ocular lens, it might compromise your vision. Alleviation by anterior radial capsulotomies will be achieved through YAG laser treatment.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> About the procedure<br /><br /> To remove the haze capsule is a minor procedure that only requires dilation of your eye.<br /><br /> The doctor will numb your eye’s front by using special eye drops, after which he/she places a tiny contact lens on the eye. Then your head needs to rest on the YAG laser machine’s frame so that your doctor can focus the laser onto the capsule.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Small holes will be made by this laser into the capsule, in such a pattern which allows the doctor to determine what can be the best treatment for your specific condition.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Because there isn’t any incision required, you won’t feel pain or be at risk to develop infections. However, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory drops for your eyes after the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Benefits of YAG capsulotomy procedures<br /><br /> •    The treatment is basically pain-free.<br /><br /> •    There isn’t any risk to get an infection.<br /><br /> •    It’s an outpatient treatment procedure.<br /><br /> •    Less healing time and trauma for your eye.<br /><br /> •    The procedure only lasts for a few minutes, though you might have to stay between one and two hours.<br /><br /> •    Reduced cost.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Recovery after the procedure<br /><br /> After the procedure, you can immediately resume normal activities and expect improvement of your vision within one day. Yet, you might experience some degree of floaters for a couple of weeks following the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> At the completion of the procedure, it’s important after a week to go back for a follow-up so that your doctor can examine the overall results, vision, and pressure. You should only as a precaution each day after your procedure tests your eye sight. Do this by closing your eye which hasn't had the surgery, and checks your eye’s vision.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Every year following the treatment you need to go for a checkup of your eyes. This is done to check for any other problems, as well as glaucoma because if your eye is just slightly unusual, examinations are critical.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Any possible risks to a YAG Capsulotomy procedure<br /><br /> Serious problems are very rare in a posterior YAG capsulotomy because it’s an extremely effective and safe procedure. However, the same as with any type of medical procedure, there might be some degree of risks involved.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The one that is very common may be the pressure that rises within your eye. When this happens the doctor can prescribe some eye drops, or maybe some combination of drops and tablets for reducing this pressure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A risk that might be a bit higher can be the detachment of your retina, as well as swelling of your macula. Nonetheless, both of these risks are quite rare, if your original surgery for cataracts with laser treatment was performed over six months earlier.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> By consulting an experienced professional eye specialist for this procedure, it may minimize your risks significantly involving posterior YAG capsulotomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Once your doctor and you decided that a posterior YAG capsulotomy will be the right choice for you, the doctor can provide you with extra information to allow you in making an informed decision of whether you want to proceed. Make sure that all questions you may have are answered to your full satisfaction.<br />Article last time updated on 24.08.2017.	Emma Kalman	2017-08-24 00:00:00	387	m2m
352	127	2	Hysterectomy Types and Complications	What is a Hysterectomy and why is it performed?<br /><br /><br /><br /> A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that consists of removing the uterus. The uterus of a woman may cause pain due to a medical issue. In this case, a doctor or gynecologist can examine the uterus and run some tests to see what the issue is. If it cannot be cured, the uterus may be removed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The most common reasons a woman needs to undergo a hysterectomy procedure are as follow:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Uterine fibroids,<br /><br /> •    Endometriosis,<br /><br /> •    Adenomyosis,<br /><br /> •    Abnormal vaginal bleeding,<br /><br /> •    Chronic pelvic pain,<br /><br /> •    Pelvic inflammatory disease,<br /><br /> •    Cervical dysplasia,<br /><br /> •    Cervical cancer,<br /><br /> •    Uterine cancer,<br /><br /> •    Ovarian cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy types<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Today, there are different surgical techniques used for performing a hysterectomy when needed, such as:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Vaginal hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed through the vagina. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of endometrial hyperplasia, cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Total abdominal hysterectomy – is the most common type of hysterectomy performed among women worldwide. This surgical procedure consists of a total removal of the uterus including the cervix. This type of hysterectomy is commonly performed in cases of ovary cancer, uterine cancer, large uterine fibroids, endometriosis, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Supracervical hysterectomy – is a surgical procedure during which the uterus is removed but the cervix is spared. A supracervical hysterectomy is recommended in cases when there is no medical indication for removing the cervix. However, later in life, there is always the possibility of cancer development in this part of the cervix that has not been surgically removed at the same time as the uterus.  This type of hysterectomy decreases the risk of vaginal prolapse as it provides some kind of support for the vagina.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopy – assisted vaginal hysterectomy – is a similar surgical procedure to the vaginal hysterectomy, but includes the use of a laparoscope. During this procedure, the upper part of the abdomen is carefully inspected when needed. Such as in cases when the removal of the ovaries is planned as well, or in cases of early stages of endometrial cancer.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy – is similar to laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Though, the difference between these two surgical procedures consists of the fact that in laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy the uterus is separated from the cervix and later removed through a laparoscopic incision. The cervix is preserved in this type of surgery. Thus, the recovery period is faster.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Radical hysterectomy – is an extensive type of surgery usually performed in cases where early stages of cervical cancer are noted. This surgical procedure consists of not only removing the uterus and the cervix but also removing the upper part of the vagina and the surrounding tissues as well. There is a great possibility of a urinary system injury, as well as a bowel injury.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Oophorectomy and scalping - oophorectomy is a surgical procedure which consists of the removal of the ovaries in cases of oophorectomy. In the case of scalping - oophorectomy the adjacent Fallopian tubes are removed as well. These two surgical procedures combined with hysterectomy are performed in cases of ovarian cancer, Fallopian tube cancer, uterine cancer, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hysterectomy Complications<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Just like any surgical procedure, a hysterectomy has its own risks and possible complications. However, in most of the cases, women do not have any complications at all after this surgical procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> According to different studies, vaginal hysterectomies are linked with fewer risks and complications when compared to abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomies. The more radical the surgical procedure is the greater is the possibility of various risks and complications following hysterectomy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Also, the recovery period is shorter in cases of vaginal hysterectomy, when compared to laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomies. Hysterectomy risks and complications greatly depend upon the type of hysterectomy procedure performed, as well as, the overall health of the women undergoing the surgery.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Common risks and complications following a hysterectomy regarding of its type include:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Blood clots,<br /><br /> •    Heavy blood loss,<br /><br /> •    Bladder injury,<br /><br /> •    Bowel injury,<br /><br /> •    Infection,<br /><br /> •    Adhesions in the pelvic area,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> •    Weakness of the pelvic muscles and ligaments which normally support the vagina, rectum and the bladder,<br /><br /> •    Difficulties urinating,<br /><br /> •    Early menopause,<br /><br /> •    Anesthesia problems, etc.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Recovering after hysterectomy<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Even though a hysterectomy is a safe surgical procedure, it is often associated with various risks and complications. In general, hospitalization for a couple of days and sometimes weeks following the surgery is required. It only depends on the overall health of the patient and the reason why this procedure is performed in the first place. The recovery period will also depend on the type of hysterectomy performed.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In cases of vaginal hysterectomy, the recovery period is faster compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, and even longer for an abdominal hysterectomy. After a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, women should be able to return to their normal daily routines within three to four weeks. In cases of abdominal hysterectomy, the recovery period will take a little bit longer, about four to six weeks.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> However, for a certain period of time after the surgery lifting heavy things, pushing or pulling objects, bending and even sexual intercourse should be avoided.<br />Article last time updated on 23.08.2017.

353	128	2	Common Complications after Surgeries	Thanks to the development of the modern medicine and science, it has become possible to conduct surgeries for almost all ailments. Of course, it is not possible to treat all health problems with the help of surgery. Nevertheless, surgery is one of the most conventional and dependable methods of the treatment of the most sicknesses. It can resolve many common diseases and deviations. Oftentimes, it saves the lives of the patients.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Regardless of the helpfulness of the surgery operations, there are several drawbacks one should consider. According to David Zelman, who received his BA from Syracuse University, MD from SUNY Downstate Medical Center and how belongs to the partnership of rheumatology at LSU Medical Center, there are certain complications, which may take place after the operation. The doctor does not claim that the surgeries are something bad. Conversely, operations have already saved millions of lives. They have a tremendous potential. Nevertheless, the doctor underline the possible problems that can take place after any surgery.<br /><br /> Even though a surgery on any occasion might be well-planned by the best experts, there still might take place some complications. At times, there may be of a serious degree. Everything depends on the particular case. However, D. Zelman points tells that there definite common consequences after the most surgeries. The experts of GradeScout highlight the next cases, which may develop after various types of surgeries. These may be:<br /><br />Pain. The feeling of pain is the most common and inevitable perception. No matter how complicated the operation was, you would surely experience post-operative pain. The physicians really can’t help this state. Nevertheless, there are some methods, which can lessen the severity of pain.<br /><br />Reaction to Anesthesia. Different individuals react differently to the influence of anesthesia. Conventionally, there happen dizziness, chills, itching, sore throat, light-headiness, an inability to orient and some similar complications. However, there may develop some other complications. All the symptoms do not have a lasting character. The most severe cases are memory loss and confusion.<br /><br />Blood pressure cases and heart deviations. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, lung ailments, breathing difficulty, a recent history of stroke, blue lips or skin.<br /><br />Infections. Little do patients give the heed to the possible infections. Nonetheless, this is a pretty common worsening of the health state. Some infections may grow into really life-threatening cases. Amongst the most common are facial flushing and swelling of definite parts of the body (commonly, these are the face, eyes, nose and throat).<br /><br />The case of fever. Generally, less than 3 men in the world have a fever. In most occasions, the most vulnerable individuals are those suffering from diabetes, obesity and those who smoke a lot.<br /><br />The urination complications. At times, there take place the problems with the urination. This a pretty rare occasion. Nonetheless, it may take place. Sometimes, a doctor may prescribe the use of the catheter. This greatly helps the bladder to releases all the natural wastes of the human body. Conventionally, this is a short-termed problem. Nonetheless, if not tending it properly, there can develop severe heath problems.<br /><br />Constipation. The problems of the digestive functioning is also a common thing to happen after surgeries. In the most cases, diet recommendations help. The prescription of various laxatives or stool softeners quickly eliminates this disorder. In addition, it is necessary to remain well-hydrated.<br /><br />Blood Clots. Another complication may blood clots. In most occasions, they develop in the course of hip or leg surgeries. The blood cloths may make your leg swallow, get red or feel the pain, as well as their similar sensations. These clots are utterly dangerous as they may pass to the lungs and induce the blockage of blood streaming.<br /><br />The complications of the breathings apparatus. Post-surgery period may cause the shortness of breathing, coughing, angina and other breathing difficulties. This type of health deviations is very rare.<br /><br />Muscle weight loss. The loss of muscle mass is another common complication while the post-operative period. Even young people may have this problem. They may lose about 1% of their muscle mass if not doing anything. The rest after an operation is really needed. The older adults lose about 5% f their muscle weight.<br /><br /> One can fully trust the experience Dr. Zelman, who has 28 years of experience in this medical field of action. These complications are not obligatory to occur. Notwithstanding, if not observing the examinee correctly, they might become the real and terrible reality. Therefore, each surgeon has to constantly check all possible outcomes of every surgery. The post-operation period does not promise to be safe.<br /><br /> Such warnings and precautions are reasonable and fair. Unfortunately, it is not possible to eliminate all of the mentioned above problems. Regardless of the qualification of a surgeon and his or her experience, there may occur various difficulties. Nevertheless, there some dependable methods, which prevent from the occurrence of the most of the undesirable events. Moreover, the physicians do their best to minimize all possible complications after the operations.<br />Article last time updated on 03.04.2017.	Hannah Siu	2017-04-03 00:00:00	648	m2m
354	129	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	659	m2m
355	132	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

356	132	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

357	132	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS. As suggested by the SEARCH Collaborative Group, the translation of this research to advance the future of clinical practice will “assist in tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring (especially when statins are used in combination with certain other drugs and during the first year of treatment, when the absolute risk of myopathy is greatest) in order to obtain the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively.” At this time, genotyping provides the clinician and patient with useful information that may affect a patient’s ability to metabolize statins, minimize the occurrence of SAMS, and understand his/her response to LDL-C lowering therapy with statins.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />OlegSirenko/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 16.09.2015.

358	133	2	A Mother in the House	As recently seen at the Huffington Post and at the Instituteforphysicianwellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />   Dear parents,<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Congratulations on your daughter’s acceptance into medical school. Like the first day of kindergarten, this launch is notable for parents as well as children.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have some concerns about the stresses she will face. Having been there, I can tell you there will be many. Not to worry, though. Times are changing. You daughter is free to learn among the brightest of the bright while avoiding the harassment women before her have faced. She will be pushed hard and much will be expected of her. However, she will not be discriminated against simply because she is a woman or may someday become a mother.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will learn without the yelling, shaming and belittling that previous generations have known. Her attending will not scream and curse at her in the hospital hallway. She will not bullied or put down. No one will tell her she is too smart for this specialty or too stupid for that one. They will respect her ideas and offer career advice only when it is asked for. No one will write songs about how stupid she is, sing them to her daily and give a copy to her to keep for future reference. No one will ever whistle at her like a dog and say “here girl.” No one will tell her to go fetch things or to heel. No one will purposely contaminate her in surgery so that she has to step aside and miss the case. When she becomes a resident, no one will call her an idiot and ask whether she even went to medical school. No one will accuse her of purposely killing a patient. No one will ever threaten to fire her on a daily basis.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   You may have heard some stories. I want to reassure you that no one will throw things at her or hit your daughter. Repeatedly. Every day. Even after she tells them not to. No one will knock her to the ground or inadvertently stab her when they are in a fit of rage. No one will demand to use her arm as a white board. No one will ever page her to a call room and try to sexually assault her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   This is 2016! You can rest assured her attendings will not text naked selfies. Or lewd email messages the night before her evaluation is due. No one will talk to other attendings about whether they have slept with your daughter. Yet. And they will never say this about her while in front of her or her colleagues. She will not be failed on her rotation for not laughing at vulgar jokes.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   No one will comment on her nipples. Or any feature of her breasts. Or butt. In front of a group of men. No one will tell her she will get higher grades in exchange for sexual favors. No one will ever undo her bra, attempt to kiss her, or grope her while she is working overnight. No one will tell her she is too pretty for medicine. Or that she could just get by on her looks. No one will tell her to wear a skirt tomorrow. Not required of course but all the girls will do it. No one will ask her for a backrub. No one will single her out in a group of men to explain the physiology behind male erections. No one will ask her loudly in the middle of the ER whether she needs to get laid. When she interviews for a competitive specialty program, the social hour won’t occur at a strip club. No one will compare her to a porn star while discussing her appearance in front of her.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   If your daughter choses to get pregnant, you can rest your mind and share in her excitement. No one will tell your pregnant daughter that she is an idiot for not knowing about birth control or for planning a pregnancy during training. No one will say that her pregnancy must have been a mistake and tell her to get an abortion. No one will criticize her or spread rumors about her for having the audacity to have children during medical training. If she is pregnant, no one will tell her she can’t run to the bathroom, vomit, or walk slowly. They will not drag her down the hall to move more quickly. When she interviews for residency spots, no one will ask her if she is planning to have more children. And why. No one will announce to your pregnant daughter that they will not accept women into the program since the one they have is already, well, you know. And no one will tell her that she has to work just as hard as everyone else if not harder to prove herself. No one will say she would be a great doctor if only she didn’t have children. No one will tell her they won’t consider her for a position since she is a mother of young children. In today’s age, everyone knows it is illegal to do that!<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will never be told that sexual harassment is just a part of the curriculum. No one will ever tell her she is just a pretty face and won’t amount to anything. She will not be singled out to make copies and get coffee. She will never be told that women make better nurses than doctors. No one will tell her she doesn’t smile enough. No one will tell her he wants to see her in a cat fight. No one will yell at her for not wearing make-up, for wearing too much make-up, for wearing clothing that is not expensive, clothing that is too revealing or not revealing enough, for taking pride in her appearance or for not taking pride in her appearance.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   She will not be held back due to a fear that her excellence will limit a man’s career. She will never be told she can’t choose a certain specialty simply because she is a woman. And when she is not told that, an attending will never make reference to her genitals. She will never be asked, either alone or in front of a group of men, what she will give in exchange for an honors grade. No one will make decisions about her career advancement based upon whether she does or might someday have children. No one will dismiss her ideas simply because she is a woman. No one will praise her male colleagues who take her ideas and present them as their own. No one will selectively limit her base salary and raises.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Don’t worry about not seeing her over the next 7+ years. She will be there for you if you really need her. No one will tell her that if she cannot handle the needs and stresses of her personal life that she is not cut out for medicine. She will be valued and respected rather than humiliated on a daily basis. Unlike those before her, she will not wonder if it would be better to die than to face another day hour minute of training.<br /><br />    <br /><br />   Rest assured. There are Mothers in the House now. Focused. Thoughtful. Intolerant of shaming. Without time to be made small. We are in all areas of medicine, leadership, research, and clinical care. And we are looking out for your little girl.<br /><br />    <br /><br /> Article last time updated on 27.10.2016.	Kathy  Stepien	2016-10-27 00:00:00	660	m2m
359	135	2	Emerging Trends in Healthcare	On October 15, 2015, I served as moderator for an esteemed panel of experts on Emerging Trends in Healthcare – 21st Century Technology and Innovation at MEDTECH 2015 – “Convergence: Building Momentum for Growth”, the MedTech Association’s Annual Conference. The panel focused on how best to leverage big data and enhance data integration, advance precision medicine, breakdown barrier through telehealth, and how early adoption of trends may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Brian McIlory, Managing director, alliance management for GE Ventures, explained, “Fundamentally, we are trying to make the patient the center of the healthcare system.”<br /><br /> Healthcare providers and payers are increasingly turning to big data and analytics to help them understand their patients and the context of each of their respective illness in more detail. A successful strategy clearly doesn’t live in a silo and everyone throughout any type of healthcare organization has a role to play and/or a stake in its successful execution. Our panel and the audience explored how convergence is central to the future of medical technology innovation. Key insights were gained pertaining to present day landscape and mobility into future possibilities.<br /><br /> Many opportunities exist when leveraging big data in healthcare. “A lot of big data projects fail because of data quality”, said Jay Goodwyn, Executive Director, IBM Buffalo Innovation Center. When analyzing big data it is imperative that one considers the quality of the raw data as well as any manipulated or derived data. Consistent definitions across the organization become critical and therefore many successful health information management efforts include an essential data governance component. It is not just about the data itself and insights, but about the actions and organizational value derived from these insights. As organizations begin to derive more value out of their information, taking it to the next level, by sharing information across silos, will become essential for increasing value of information for healthcare.<br /><br /> Data integration, the process of reconciling information from numerous sources and organization, remains a major challenge in the industry. It is of a heightened complexity in healthcare because of the historic siloed nature of payers, providers, labs, pharmacy, etc., and the inherent complex nature of the data itself. In addition, healthcare data tends to be even more unstructured and large than other industries with more data stored in forms such as text documents and images and real-time scanner data. Using big data techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and data stream technology for example becomes of paramount importance.<br /><br /> The panel discussed opportunities that exist through personalized medicine, or more appropriately, precision medicine. The panel next recognized the concept of precision medicine, which emerged from a 2010 National Academy of Sciences report that stated “the concept of precision medicine is to “transform medical care worldwide by integrating the wealth of data emerging from both the human genome and research on the molecular basis of disease, with information from patients’ health records and environmental data.”” Dr. Robert Corona, Chairman of Pathology and Laboratory Machine, Upstate Medical University, examined how the future of healthcare may be impacted by precision medicine – by taking into account variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle, treatments can be custom built for each patient. This individualized approach to treating illnesses may improve how we manage diseases overall as well as improve patient outcomes.  <br /><br /> Recent emerging trends are truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. There is a high associated cost benefit with these technologies. Many companies are already leveraging big data and novel research methods to bring the benefits of telehealth to areas within our state, across the country, and around the globe. Once considered a novelty, telehealth or telemedicine, is now standard medical practice in daily use by healthcare practitioners throughout the world. By treating patients remotely, the extra expense of regular office visits can be spared. Telehealth has also been shown to reduce the need for hospital readmissions, which can be detrimental for patients, and are a significant expense to healthcare facilities. The panel offered their thoughts about opportunities existing within telehealth and the role their organizations are playing in advancing telemedicine.<br /><br /> Dr. Corona examined how to break down geographic barriers when treating patients. Telehealth breaks down those barriers to improve care. Via telehealth, physicians can reach a broader patient demographic. For those patients who are not privy to quality healthcare within their region, telemedicine can provide an additional avenue for quality care. Brian McIlory added, “We’re all driven by cost, quality, and access.”<br /><br /> In closing this panel discussion, I took the opportunity to share a quote from W. Edwards Deming, a renowned data scientist, who once said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”<br /><br />Leveraging big data and optimising precision medicine and telehealth are just the beginning of the rapid changes occurring in healthcare.<br /><br /> Acknowledgement<br /><br /> The author and panelists wish to thank Anthony Melito, Editor and Editorial Operations Manager at AXON Communications (www.axon-com.com) for his editorial support in the preparation of this blog entry. <br /><br />Image copyright: <br />kentoh, Thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 13.11.2015.

360	135	2	Treating T1D with Transplantation + Immunomodulation	"Embracing a minimally invasive approach in T1D<br /><br /> At the recent Alliance for the Advancement of Cellular Therapies (AACT) 2015 Conference, which highlights the progress and promise of regenerative medicine and cellular therapies, Adeeb Al-Zoubi, Ph.D,. a Clinical Assistant Professor at The University of Illinois College of Medicine (UIC) in Peoria and CEO of Stem Cells of Arabia in Amman, Jordan, and Brigadier General Dr. Hazem Habboub, Head of Radiology at The Royal Medical Services of Jordan, presented their initial findings from a clinical study treating patients with T1D.<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi and his team have developed a novel way to purify specific types of stem cells from diabetic patient's blood that are able to differentiate into insulin-secreting beta cells when transplanted into pancreatic tissues. The purified cells are then delivered to the pancreas using interventional radiology techniques under the guidance of Dr. Habboub and his team, using a novel method to implant the purified cells into micro-capillaries in the region of the pancreas richest in insulin production. This minimally invasive procedure does not require surgery or general anesthesia. <br /><br /> He added that, ""This unique and sophisticated therapeutic approach supports beta cell regeneration, combined with the previously published immunomodulation protocol, utilizes cutting edge science and was carried out in collaborations with top scientists and medical professionals at The University of Illinois, The Royal Medical Services and the Al-Khaldi Hospital and Medical Center in Amman"".<br /><br />Developing safe and effective methods – building on a history of success<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi started working on this project 18 years ago at UIC during his Ph.D. training with Dr. Bellur Prabhakar at UIC. Their study was aimed at understanding the nature of the immune attack on the insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas that lead to the development of T1D. Further research showed that it was possible to stop the immune attack on pancreatic beta cells through immunomodulation. Dr. Zhao–now Clinical Professor at Hackensack Medical University–further demonstrated the capacity of specific stem cells to differentiate into insulin secreting beta cells.<br /><br />Envisaging the future of treatment of patients with T1D<br /><br /> Dr. Al-Zoubi explained what these initial findings mean for clinicians and clarified how they should manage patient expectations. “It means there is hope for T1D patients to be treated in the future. However, this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase and is not approved as a standard method of treatment. For clinicians, it means to expect some good news for their patients within the upcoming few months… We still need to follow up the treated patients to collect enough data and publish them.”<br /><br /> For patients reading or hearing about this novel treatment, Dr. Al-Zoubi said, “We advise the clinicians to specifically inform the patients that this treatment is still at the clinical trial phase, and the research team in Jordan is working to bring this research to the United States.”<br /><br /> Collaborative efforts are continuing with planned expansion of clinical trials to treat patients with T1D in the U.S.<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />Ugreen/thinkstock <br />Article last time updated on 05.10.2015."

361	135	2	Managing Patients At-Risk of Statin-induced Myopathy	State of statin safety challenges and suboptimal adherence<br /><br /> While countries, employers, insurers, and patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) determine how they will now pay for the emerging class of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors many clinicians continue to wrestle with statin intolerance and researchers continue to analyze the genetic variants of an individual’s metabolic response. Few doubt that statins have been proven effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, these treatments do not come without a challenge in terms of nonadherence due to side effects. For some patients, statin treatment remains suboptimal due to muscle aches, spasms, and pain.<br /><br />Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)—a key consideration in treatment discontinuation<br /><br /> SAMS are a key contributor to statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation. Researchers suggest the frequency of SAMS to be less than 5% (as seen in well-controlled clinical trials), but the frequency of SAMS has been reported as high as 25% of current statin users or 60% of former users. While SAMS may resolve quickly with the discontinuation of the statin, in the Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational Conditions (PRIMO) study, SAMS were shown to take as long as two months to resolve. In rare cases, statin-induced myopathy can become debilitating.<br /><br />The science behind the symptoms—SLCO1B1, SNPs, and SAMS<br /><br /> Some researchers have suggested an association between SAMS and variations in the SLCO1B1 gene. Inherited variations in the SLCO1B1 gene known as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affect the function of this transporter. The presence of this variant, especially in homozygotes, results in significantly decreased ability to take up statins, less effectiveness of some statins in lowering LDL-C, higher blood levels after dosing, and an increased risk of SAMS. Studies have shown that people who have particular inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene are 4-17 times more likely to suffer SAMS as a side effect. Despite this evidence, further research is needed, as in a recent review on the pharmacogenetics of SAMS, researchers have clearly stated that, “a current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking.”<br /><br />A call-to-action for clinicians<br /><br /> In a recent interview, an industry leader in diagnostics testing shared that the “test [for genotyping SLCO1B1 polymorphisms] is not diagnostic, not confirmatory, just indicates a higher risk of getting a problem on a statin.” While we cannot clearly label this approach as personalized or precision medicine like recent cardiovascular advances, data continue to emerge on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SAMS.

362	136	2	Essential Oils For Weight Loss to Fight Against Overweight!	People who plan to reduce body weight often start using complex techniques and among them may be essential oils for weight loss. But also it is important have a healthy diet, improve the way of life and body condition, try solving psychological problems.<br /><br />The first thing that is needed to discover is what essential oils are good for weight loss. As a rule, the reason of overweight is a physiological body malfunction: metabolic disorders, fluid stagnation, etc. Consequently, it is reasonable to choose oils that are able to effectively normalize metabolism and give diuretic effect.<br /><br />Various types of essential oils helping to lose excessive weight<br /><br />1. Soothing and relaxing oils<br /><br />All essential oils bring some advantages, but the best ones to fight against overweight should have soothing and relaxing effects. Among them are jasmine, orange, lavender.<br /><br />2. Essential oils for removing excess liquid<br /><br />Oils that lead to fat loss are also the ones that release excess fluid from the organism, providing a mild diuretic effect. Some oils with such an effect fennel lemon, juniper, grapefruit, , rosemary, cypress.<br /><br />3. Oils reducing appetite<br /><br />To fight an unjustified desire to constantly eat something, it is required to have a bottle of some oil in the pocket, and inhale it whenever the flavor or outlook of food causes an appetite. You should pick the oil of sweet dill, lemon, cypress, green apple.<br /><br />Fish oil is a useful mean to lose weight and heal the whole body<br /><br />Fish oil - a natural product contains a large number of nutrients that can provide excellent help in combating excess kilograms.<br /><br />Fish oil for weight loss - not a magic tool and won't help to reduce weight noticeably in a short time. It has to be used with diet, physical loads, only in this case it will normalize metabolism and help to get rid of overweight.<br /><br />Juniper oil is really great for effective weight losing<br /><br />If we talk about weight loss supplements then the first place is to put juniper oil, which has diuretic and metabolizing properties. If you plan to reduce weight, take this oil inside by dropping 2-3 drops on a piece of sugar or half a teaspoon of honey. Take in a half an hour before breakfast, and an hour after dinner. It will help not only to get rid of excess fluid, but also will clean of toxic deposits accumulated in the body that will cause weight loss.<br /><br />Essential oil of cypress to get rid of excessive kilograms of the body<br /><br />If you want to strengthen effect of massage and cleansing baths, it is advised to purchase cypress oil. To make mean that helps to reduce weight, combine the following oils: 13 drops of cypress, 12 drops of juniper and 50 ml of jojoba. This mixture is needed to rub into the skin. Massage with essential oils for weight loss is similar to anti-cellulite one.<br />Article last time updated on 03.01.2018.	Ann Morgan	2018-01-03 00:00:00	155	m2m
363	136	2	Description of natural brain boosters – Omega-3 essential fatty acids!	Do you want to live to the extreme old age with a lucid mind and good health? Take care of this in advance. Studies show that Italians and Japanese are long-livers. Every day they eat fresh sea fish and other foods rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. These substances are considered natural brain boosters.<br /><br />Omega-3 are not produced by the body and should be consumed with food or special supplements. Therefore, they are called essential (Omega-3 cannot be substituted by other nutrients). Unfortunately, our diet is dominated by vegetable oils with an omega-6 fatty acid content. This is, first of all, sunflower oil.<br /><br />Why should we get Omega-3 fatty acids?<br /><br />Ideally, Omega 3, 6, 9 fatty acids should be delivered to the body in in the correct proportion. In practice, it is difficult task. Omega-6 fats predominate in the diet of modern man. They are found in animal sources and in most vegetable oils. Omega-3 is found only in certain foods, including oily fish and linseed oil.<br /><br />It has been proven that omega-3 fatty acids have a positive effect on the functioning of the cardiovascular system. The risk of a stroke and heart attack is reduced. Omega-3 improves the condition of the vessels, prevents the occurrence of inflammation and occurrence of cholesterol plaques.<br /><br />Each cell needs Omega-3 fatty acids<br /><br />Omega-3 fatty acids are part of the cell membrane. A healthy cell passes inside useful substances and releases waste. The membrane of the cell must be permeable and elastic. Omega-3 improves the permeability of the cell membrane and the state of the capillaries. Fats from animal sources that enter the body in large quantities, on the contrary, worsen the permeability of cell membranes.<br /><br />The use of Omega-3 for brain function<br /><br />Good memory and strong nervous system are necessary qualities in the modern world. Omega-3 fatty acids improve the conductivity of neural connections in the brain. They increase transmission of nerve impulses from the cell to the cell. This leads to a memory enhancement, an increase in the cognitive abilities and quality of learning in general. In adulthood, Omega-3 protect people from senile dementia and atherosclerosis.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Foods that contain Omega-3 fatty acids<br /><br />It is important to monitor the constant delivering of Omega-3 brain booster into the body. Fatty acids can also be taken in the form of food supplements. First of all, it is fish oil in capsules. A rich source of Omega-3 is the fish of fatty varieties inhabiting oceans. These fish products include mackerel, salmon, and tuna. Omega-3 is also found in vegetable oils.<br /><br />The richest source of omega-3 is flaxseed oil. The content of Omega-3 in cold pressed flaxseed oil is 57%. Therefore, probably, this oil is the best brain booster (or one of the best). Sunflower oil does not contain Omega-3 fatty acids. In olive oil, the content of Omega-3 is only 0.6%.<br />Article last time updated on 08.12.2017.	Ann Morgan	2017-12-08 00:00:00	168	m2m

In order to avoid getting cold, you can follow few easy, effective steps to keep yourself fit and healthy this winter!<br /><br /><br /><br />1# Dress Warm: As the weather is extremely cold outside as well as inside the room, it’s better to wear winter outfits including jackets, pullovers, sweaters, etc even while going to your workplace. These will prevent you from freezing, and keep your body warm.   <br /><br />2# Drink Lots of Water: You are suggested to drink almost eight to ten glasses of water a day in winter to keep yourself hydrated. Water intake plays a valuable part in battling illness. Hence, never limit yourself in drinking less water.<br /><br />3# Take Breaks in Between and Move Around: Every two to three hours at office, get up and move here and there to straighten your back. Constantly sitting at one place can hamper your health in weight gain! When you move around for a while, you also feel warmth from within.<br /><br />4# Avoid sharing anything when unwell: As you know that the germs have a tendency to spread out soon. So avoid sharing your lunch or drinks with anyone or having lunch from other’s tiffin-box. Winter germs around you tend to creep around the other persons too.<br /><br />5# Wash your Hands: It is very hygienic to wash your hands frequently. People at workplace tend to put one or two fingers in mouth in between while concentrating working on their projects, so they’re recommended to keep hands clean. One can also use a sanitizer to ward off germs.<br /><br />6# Fruits and Vegetable a Must: Your New Year resolution must be to be healthy; so start taking fruits and green veggies on daily basis which will add adequate amount of protein and vitamin in your body and make your immune system strong. Evade those pizza and fast foods this season, and head towards vegetable sizzlers, and fruit and vegetable salads.<br /><br />7# Evade Sick Co-Workers: If your co-worker had to come to office in spite of their sickness, they tend to sneeze or cough often at workplace also. Though it may not be possible to avoid them completely, but try to stay away from them or maintain a distance for 2-3 days.<br /><br />8# Go on a Vacation: You might have reserved few leaves for year-end.

365	137	2	All You Need to Know About Dental Implants	You might wonder for the solution of your missing teeth if you have never consulted a dentist. Whether it is a requirement to find an emergency dentist in Indianapolis or just an old accident making you hide your beautiful smile, a dental implant can make you fully confident to smile wide.<br /><br /> Well, what could be the better option to replace missing teeth? The only answer is a dental implant. And what could be better than a dental implant? The natural tooth. But can a dental implant be as perfect as a natural tooth? Yes, it certainly can be. If a natural tooth is firmly anchored to the jawbone with deep roots, so does an implanted tooth. If you are curious to know about dental implants, go ahead and read more to have fundamental information about the same:<br /><br />- Dental implants<br /><br /> The dental implant is a tiny titanium root like screw which is inserted where a tooth is missing. This metal anchor is a substitute to the lost tooth. An implanted tooth can be surgically placed into the jawbone which bonds with used material or titanium, building a strong foundation for an artificial tooth with the bone.<br /><br /> Small posts are attached to the implant that pokes out through the gums. The posts or screws provide stable anchors for artificial replaced teeth, dentures or partials. A dental implant helps to maintain the facial structure and prevents bone deterioration that can happen when a tooth is absent or missing.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Types of dental implants<br /><br />> Crown, a single prosthesis is used to replace one lost tooth where each prosthesis tooth is attached to its own implant.<br /><br />> Fixed bridge means a partial prosthesis or a complete prosthesis. A partial prosthesis can fix two or more teeth at once with the same number of implants while a complete prosthesis can replace all the teeth of upper and lower jaw with dental implantation.<br /><br /> Here the number of implants depends on the type of complete prosthesis recommended which can be removable or fixed. A removable prosthesis attaches to a ball or a bar in socket attachments, while a fixed prosthesis is stuck permanently and only a dentist can remove it.<br /><br /> Many patients think that Dentures offer most affordable, low-cost and the best solution. Thus, they prefer to go for it which is not right. In the long run, dental implantation pays off with more advantages of a long lasting natural looking smile.<br /><br />- Why you should get the dental implants<br /><br /> It is understandable that before you go for any health treatment, you would make sure why you need it. If you are a bit confused about why you should get the dental implants, here are the points to ponder on:<br /><br />> Implantation does not just replace the missing tooth but also brings back the comfort that was lost once from chewing with a previous natural tooth.<br /><br />> It gear ups the confidence and secure feeling to speak, smile and chew at social gatherings and places.

When the upper body is elevated, gravity lessens up the chances of the stomach contents to come back up into the esophagus.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A wedge pillow can be used while sleeping on your back or on your side without causing any problems or sprains with your head or neck. Most of the pillows available in the market allow 30 to 45 degrees elevation or 6-8 inches at the top.

In the occasion, you do not provide a normal physical activity you will not be able to burn the required amounts of fat stored by your organism.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> However, the inappropriate physical activity is not the only factor that may lead to this problem. The prestigious British Medical Journal or simply BMJ made a special research and tried to include different factors that develop this disease.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Amongst them are:<br /><br />  A natural predisposition for overweight. Some people are predisposed to gain abnormal weight in brief period of time due to their natural characteristics.<br /><br />  Some health ailments that are associated with weight gain. There is a variety of ailments that can cause overweight, which lead to obesity. One of the most typical examples is an imbalance of chemicals in the cerebrum. Due to the production of definite neurotransmitters, people are not able to control their hunger. This is a psychological factor. Nevertheless, there are also physical ailments.<br /><br />  Unhealthy foods and drinks. The consumption of unhealthy products that are more affordable that the healthy ones, a constant advertising of nutrient empty foods, food subsidies that favor the fewer healthy products make people choose the harmful products.<br /><br />  Local environment. Physical activity may be not sufficient thanks to some factors out of the nearest environment. For instance, the overly frequent reliance on cars or office work.<br /><br />  Social conditions. Here may be mentioned such reasons as lack of finance for a proper nutrition, poor work conditions, undermining of the material and psychological resources and so on.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Conclusions<br /><br /> Judging from the mentioned above facts, it is obvious that the issue of obesity is really serious. The disease is very dangerous, though somebody might think in a different way. Nevertheless, the facts and possible risks are undeniable. Unfortunately, the predictions of the experts are not promising. The humanity will face the increase in obesity cases, especially in children. Therefore, the WHO and other organizations should develop efficacious strategies for the reduction of these cases. Thus, the disease may be stopped. There is a huge need in dependable methodologies, which should be implemented in the nearest future.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> About author: Sarah Richmond is a 32-years-old health blogger who writes on different problems associated with health.

375	140	2	Kneecaps and Newborn babies	Are you going to be a mother for the first time? If yes, then congratulations! Often, we get confused regarding the health of a newborn as there are some obvious differences of physical structure of a bay with that of a full grown human being.<br /><br /> For first time mothers are babies born with kneecaps become one of the most asked questions. Here are some of the facts you do need to know regarding the kneecaps and whether it should be there in a newborn’s body. Give it a read.<br /><br /> Ø  For adults, the kneecap is a patella which is formed at the end of the femur. This bone structure helps the knee work properly as well as remain responsible for the proper functioning of the knee including muscles and proper joints. If you have a newborn baby with you, they don’t have kneecaps per se in the sense that they don’t have bones in their body.<br /><br /> Ø  For the bone structure of a newborn, they have cartilage which are the premature stage of the bone in our bodies. All our bones were once in the cartilage form. The process of cartilages turning into bones is called ossification. This process is a slow one indeed, and it takes more than three years for a baby in its kneecap. Therefore, if it takes much time, don’t get worried for nothing. This is a normal physiological process that is slightly time-consuming.<br /><br /> Ø  Make sure you are taking your baby through enough physical exercise. Otherwise, the baby will gain fat in its childhood which often creates unnecessary problems during the ossification.<br /><br /> Ø  The patella turns into bone and starts functioning properly when the baby grows. All this time, the cartilage goes through the process of ossification, and this is why the process of physical exercise is so important for them.<br /><br /> Ø  Many think, that the human kneecap is made of bones from the very time of their birth. This is a misconception and now you know how a kneecap is formed, with time. For a newborn, a kneecap is cartilages that are roughly attached to the tendon at the end part of the femur. So, make sure you are taking proper care of the baby’s health when the bones are not formed properly and the kneecap is going through the process of ossification.<br /><br /> Ø  Knees are the most important organ in a human body after heart. All our movements, our balance in the lower parts of our body is actually maintained by the patella tuned kneecap. So, keep strict care of the patella of your newborn. You don’t need some unwarranted problems to arise for the child when then grow up to be adults.<br /><br /> Ø  Also, don’t panic when someone tells you they have babies with proper kneecaps. No one has that. It takes time and is a natural process for all the human beings alike.<br /><br /> Now you know the answer to the question of do newborn babies have kneecaps. All the best for your newborn!<br />Article last time updated on 18.07.2017.	Diego Wii	2017-07-18 00:00:00	345	m2m

So, a lot of them tend to go for e-cigarettes instead, thinking that they will cause less harm since the nicotine is not entering the system. However, there are some finer details that a lot of people are not aware of when it comes to these electronic cigarettes.<br /><br /> To put it in simple words, E-Cigarettes During Pregnancy is not at all a good choice since it is harmful for both the mother and the baby. In order to fully comprehend the risks associated with this habit when it comes to pregnancy, we need to first understand what the basic difference between e-cigarettes and normal cigarette is.<br /><br />Understanding the difference<br /><br /> E-cigarettes are basically electronic devices which contains a kind of liquid. This liquid has various chemicals present within it with a concentrated amount of nicotine. Now when the cigarette is lighted the water with the nicotine it is gets heated up and produces a water vapour that is inhaled. Since one inhales the water vapour coming from the cigarettes it is also referred to as vaping. Now the main difference between regular cigarettes is that in case of a regular cigarette the smoke is produced when nicotine burns with tobacco and the fumes that we inhale contains various harmful elements. However, the presence of nicotine in both these types of cigarettes is almost always the same and hence e-cigarettes are no way less harmful than the regular ones and not at all advisable for someone who is pregnant.<br /><br /> In fact, there are various reports that show how little people are aware of the harmful effects of these e-cigarettes. People tend to believe that these are way safer than the regular ones and some of them are also of the opinion that they do not contain nicotine since they taste different.

The risks of vaping when pregnant are manifold. Nicotine is the element that causes maximum harm to the baby and that is present in substantial amounts inn e-cigarettes. Apart from some of the common consequences like still birth, miscarriage, deformation in the baby’s growth and various other complications, there might be even rare conditions in the baby and its organs might not even be able to fully develop if one does not stop smoking during pregnancy. In fact, the point is not just about stopping smoking regular cigarettes, but it is more about not putting any nicotine inside your body.<br /><br /> So, the main conclusion to arrive at from this is that e-cigarette smoking is bad for you and your baby. If you are having difficulties to quit the stick, it is best if you consult an addiction counsellor if you know that you are pregnant or want to stop this harmful habit. <br />Article last time updated on 15.06.2017.

378	140	2	How to select the right sleeping option for your baby	Just like everybody needs sleep after a day’s tiring work, similarly, every baby too needs its sleep, especially the newborn ones. You will always see that the newborns are dozing in your arms or have their eyes closed. These little cuties need their sleep and hence you must make sure that you have the best sleeping options lined up for them.<br /><br /> Well one might just wonder over here that why do newborns seem to be asleep all the time. The thing is pretty simple. They are used to sleeping and dozing most of the time when in the mother’s womb and hence once they come out they tend to stick to their sleeping habits and gradually come out of it. But, whatever it might when it comes to sleeping the proper comfort is necessary so that the baby can maintain a proper posture and for that you must consider the best newborn baby sleeping options! Here are some of the classical and not so classical one’s for you to choose from:<br /><br /> 1.      The Crib: Well, these are everybody’s favorite. Though it is not advisable that you bring the newborn home and directly place it in the crib. Try to sleep with the baby beside and then after a few months you can place it in the crib. These are pretty easily available and hence very commonly used. However, cribs are really expensive and they have larger areas than what your newborn might need which will actually cause discomfort for the baby since it is used to sleeping in a warm and cozy surrounding- its mother’s womb.<br /><br /> 2.      The bassinet: This is another option that you can consider for your baby. These are cozier than cribs since they are smaller in size and hence have that warm factor that your baby will be missing in case of a crib. However, when it comes to bassinets they are not exactly easy to move around in the house since they do not come with any wheels and the number of designs that you will find for these are also limited.<br /><br /> 3.      The co-sleeper: This is probably one of the most convenient options that you have when it comes to sleeping options for babies. These are just like cribs, except that they are shorter in height and hence when you place it right by the bed, you can easily pick up the baby in your arms as and when needed!<br /><br /> 4.      Baby hammocks: You can now literally rock your baby to sleep without lifting a finger thanks to this remarkable of all the sleeping options for the newborn baby. These have an inherent rocking motion that sets off once you put the baby inside it and it will create the motion that will help the baby to fall asleep easily.<br /><br /> 5.      Moses basket: If you are looking for a cheap option that will help you in carrying your baby around then you might want to try this one. However, this is one is not too favorable for your baby’s posture.<br /><br /> So, if you want to make sure you get the best sleeping option for your baby, then pick one from the top five that you have listed above!<br />Article last time updated on 15.06.2017.

379	140	2	Answering the age-old debate about kneecaps in babies	There is an unending mystery about the development of human life, particularly babies. And if you are about to be a mom soon, then it is going to be a pretty overwhelming time coming up for you. You will be asked plenty of questions about your baby, half of which you do not even know yourself!<br /><br /> Well, here is one question that you will definitely come across- are babies born with kneecaps? Does your baby have a knee cap? Wondering what that means? Well, not to worry, here’ s are some facts about kneecaps that will definitely help you to understand what kneecaps exactly are and how and in what way they develop in babies-<br /><br />What is a kneecap?<br /><br /> Do you feel that slight bulge in your knee which is quite hard and strong? Well that is known as the patella. This patella is what the knee cap is. It basically acts as a protective cover or sheathing that guards your ball and socket joint against the impact of injuries. The ball and socket joints are some of the most important joints in your body. The fact that you can run or bend your leg is only because of the ball and socket joint. If you hurt this joint then it is very likely that you will take a long time to recover from it. Hence the human body provides a natural cover for your joint in the knee area, which are the most important ball and socket joints apart from the one in your pelvic region. Thus, the kneecap is basically a protective measure that helps in protecting your knees.<br /><br />How does the patella or knee cap develop?<br /><br /> What you find as a bony structure as an adult, has not always been like that. Touch your ear lobe- do you feel the softness quality of it? Well, that is because it is a cartilage and not a bone. Cartilages are formed and from there bones are then formed. This process of bone formation from cartilages is known as ossification. When it comes to kids who are growing, this is why dairy products are necessary since they contain large amounts of calcium and vitamin D that helps in the absorption of calcium which in turn helps in the process of ossification.  Do you know why ossification is important for a growing child?<br /><br /> Well, remember the famous thing that all our mothers used to say, “Have your milk, then you will have stronger bones!” This is because as a child you have cartilages in place of bones. These cartilages began to grow stronger with ossification and bone structures are created. So if someone asks you do newborn babies have kneecaps you can safely conclude that no they do not because they are born with cartilages in place of bones. The knee cap develops over a long period of time to form the hard and bony structure that you see today. Knee caps or the bony patella is completely formed during the time of puberty.<br /><br /> So, now you are armed with one more data about babies. So, go ahead and prepare yourself for the journey of motherhood!<br />Article last time updated on 15.06.2017.	Diego Wii	2017-06-15 00:00:00	260	m2m
380	140	2	Pregnancy Tests: True Pregnancy or False Result?	Are you and your partner trying? Do you want to know for sure whether you are pregnant or not? Well the easiest way to detect at home whether you are pregnant or not is through a home pregnancy test. But did you know that not all pregnancy home tests can be trusted?<br /><br />The home pregnancy test<br /><br /> You can do a home pregnancy test with the help of a pregnancy kit which are widely available in the market today. But the best way to confirm your pregnancy is through an ultrasound which can actually capture the image and detect the presence of the growing foetus in your body. When women experience typical pregnancy syndromes like fatigue, nausea, craving for a particular food item or repulsion towards certain things like food, smell, a missed period etc, they generally opt for a home pregnancy test. In fact when you visit a doctor, she or he will first ask you whether you have done a test or not. However the results of the test cannot always be trusted. It can show a Pregnancy Test False Negative or just the opposite for various reasons. You might actually be pregnant and that might not show up in the test! So it is always best to consult a doctor if you feel changes that are typically associated with pregnancy.<br /><br />How can a home pregnancy test be wrong?<br /><br /> First and foremost you need to understand that most of the pregnancy kits are hardly ever faulty. Out of 10, 8 might be, but the chances are extremely rare. So how come you have a false negative? Well there are a number of reasons behind it, to understand which you need to know how these kits function. You need your urine sample, preferably the first urine in the morning, because these kits use the sample to detect whether HCG or the pregnancy hormone is present in your urine or not. However, the amount of detectable HCG in your urine will vary and that is the main cause behind these tests yielding false results.<br /><br /> Your test can show you a false negative if you do it do early. It will take about 10-14 days for the fertilised egg to attach to the uterine wall and initiate enough HCG hormones that will become detectable in your urine. If you take the test within 48-72hours after the time of conception, then there are high chances that it will turn out to be negative. So it is best to try the test again after a week or so if you feel the symptoms. Another uncommon but a possible reason for yielding a false negative is that if too much HCG is present in your urine; more than what the kits can detect.<br /><br /> In order to understand why a pregnancy test can be wrong and show a false positive, you have to take into consideration factors like residual HCG in your urine from an early miscarriage, HCG left from any kind of fertility treatment that you might be going through etc.<br /><br /> Though pregnancy tests at home are hardly wrong, if you want to be absolutely sure, check up with your doctor and get an ultrasound done. <br />Article last time updated on 06.06.2017.

381	140	2	Is Douching Safe During Pregnancy?	Douching is a process to clean your vagina with water or other fluids such as vinegar or iodine. The liquid is inserted through a tube or nozzle into the vagina. According to some medical experts, women should never douche, regardless of whether they are pregnant or not. According to a US Department of Health and Human Services publication, nearly a quarter of women in the age group 15 to 44 years douche.<br /><br />Does douching alter my fertility? Is douching during pregnancy safe for me and my baby?<br /><br /> Douching as often as once a month may make it difficult for you to conceive. However, research suggests that douching after sex has no impact on the odds of getting pregnant. Douching has been associated with a higher incidence of ectopic pregnancy. This means that your likelihood of conceiving are reduced.<br /><br /> If you douche during pregnancy, there is an increased risk of delivering prematurely. Therfore, douching while pregnant is not recommended.<br /><br /> The health problems associated with douching can be long-lasting. They include bacterial vaginosis, infection in the vagina, and risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. Douching can facilitate a number of health problems since it alters the balance of the vaginal flora and the natural acidity found in the vagina. This means that, along with the harmful bacteria, the good bacteria are eliminated as well.<br /><br /><br /><br /> When you douce, your levels of vaginal bacteria change considerably, increasing your risk of yeast infections and irritation in the vaginal area. Studies also point to the fact that, when you douche, you increase your chances of exposure to phthalates. These are chemicals that are used to soften plastic or vinyl, as in the case of toys or personal grooming products.<br /><br /> Many women who douch convey to their doctors that they undertook this procedure for hygienic reasons. However, one of the the main problems with douching is that it impacts considerably on both the benefitial as well as the harmful bacteria in the vagina area.<br /><br />Then, what should I do to clean my vagina when I am pregnant?<br /><br /> When you bath, the outside of your vagina can be washed with warm water. Regarding the inside, it is preferable if you let it clean itself with its mucus. If you have thick vaginal discharge or redness and irritation around the region of your vagina, consult with your doctor.<br />Article last time updated on 25.05.2017.

382	140	2	Is vaginal douche safe during pregnancy?	For all those wondering whether vaginal douche is safe during the course of pregnancy, here is a word of advice, No. The process involves cleaning the vagina with water or other fluids such as vinegar or iodine, and this is done by squirting the liquid through a nozzle or tube inserted in the vagina. According to research by eminent medical professionals, any woman, be it pregnant or not should not douche. But a quarter of women in the age bracket of 15 to 44 years do douche.<br /><br /> Douching once a month reduces the chances of being pregnant, and research suggests douching will not prevent you from becoming pregnant. Douching does increase the chances of ectopic pregnancy that makes it difficult to conceive in the future. If douching pregnancy is undertaken, the possibility of an early delivery cannot be ruled out. Some of the other health problems related with douching include bacterial vaginosis, HIV causes AIDS, dryness or irritation in the vagina. A recent study, which was published in the month of August that when you douched for the last six months, it was associated with an increase paving way for a higher rate of infections. This led to all types of genital human papillomvirus and there are 200 of them along with a risk of high HPV types. This includes a dozen of them that can cause cervical cancer along with other types of cancer, while other HPV types cause genital warts.<br /><br /> Another study pointed that vaginal douche does increase the exposure to phthalates. They are chemicals used to soften plastic and vinyl, as in the case of toys, there are also used in personal care products and cosmetics such as douches. They have been linked to developmental or behavioural issues to children who have been exposed in the womb.<br /><br /> Why do women douche is the thing which we need to figure out? In a study, which was conducted in Los Angeles asked 141 women, whether they douched and the answer was yes. They found out that 6 out of 10 African women douched and 4 out of 10 Latin American women douched, which proves that the former tends to douche more.<br /><br /> Most women who douche in Los Angeles told that they did it for maintaining their personal hygiene. But the problem is that douching goes on to disturb the balance of the good along with the bad bacteria in the body.<br /><br /> Now the question is what you are supposed to do when you need to clean the vagina? When you bathe, wash the outside of it with warm water, and from the inside, the best mechanism would be to let the vagina clean itself by forming mucus. You need to figure out that a clean and healthy vagina will not smell like a rose garden, and you should get in touch with your doctor if you tend to have a thick vaginal discharge with or without any form of swelling, pain while urinating or having sex as well as swelling or redness in the area around your vagina.<br />Article last time updated on 17.05.2017.

383	140	2	What To Tell Your Patient With Gestational Diabetes	Gestational diabetes is a common common condition during pregnancy. Luckily, there are effective ways to keep it under control.<br /><br />What are the causes and symptoms?<br /> There are several maternal risks of diabetes in pregnancy. The most common symptoms of type 1 diabetes are increased thirst, constant hunger, urination, blurred vision, weight loss, and extreme fatigue. This can make your pregnancy journey more difficult.<br /> Most pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes do not have type 1 diabetes but type 2 diabetes. The most common symptoms of type 2 diabetes are bladder or kidney problems, increased urination and thirst, fatigue and need to have meals constantly.<br /><br /> Gestational diabetes may have a genetic component. However, this has not been confirmed yet.<br /><br /> When you are pregnant, your placenta will make hormones which will accumulate sugar in your blood. Your pancreas will make enough insulin to handle everything. However, if you do not produce enough insulin (or if your pancreas produces too much of it), your blood sugar levels will be disturbed. This will then lead to gestational diabetes.How will it harm the baby?<br /> If you detect the problem during your early stages of pregnancy, there are treatments that can be very effective. With good monitoring and treatment, your glucose levels can be kept under control.<br /><br /> Mothers who have uncontrolled gestational diabetes have very large babies. This is known as fetal macrosomia. This condition makes the delivery very difficult and often requires a C-section. It can also increase your blood pressure levels, which will further complicate things.<br /> The best way to protect yourself from gestational diabetes is to avoid stress as much as possible, to limit your sugar consumption and to be active. Go for walks, stay active and keep a watch on your diet. Get regular tests and let your doctor know if you experience symptoms that worry you.<br />Article last time updated on 14.05.2017.

384	140	2	How to breastfeed after surgery	Most women would have had surgery of some kind. This may include breast reduction to reduce the size of the breasts or augmentation to increase the size of it. Now the question that might come to your mind is can you breastfeed with implants? Yes, you can do so, but how successful it will be depending to a large extent on the type of surgery you had in the first place. For the matter of fact even if you are able to produce some amount of milk it would be to better to supplement with a dose of supplements.<br /><br /> Milk is produced in the glandular tissue of the breast and then travels through the nipples with what is known as the milk ducts. If you had surgery of any time, then you need to cross check the fact on whether your milk ducts were interrupted or damaged in any way. In case of some surgeries milk ducts are cut whereas in case of others it is not the case. Even if they are cut, it may go on to heal after surgery and be able to produce milk after the course of surgery. If you had any form of surgery and still want to breastfeed the baby, then you should get in touch with a doctor to obtain the necessary go ahead. If this is the case, you can go on to provide them with the necessary medical records of your surgery and make sure that they are aware of the fact that you had any form of breast surgery and they tend to focus more on the growth of the baby.<br /><br />Breast augmentation or reduction<br /><br /> Most of the increase in the size of the breasts is undertaken through the technique of silicon transplantation. It depends on the size of your breasts and how much you want to enlarge or reduce them is the key. When it is the case of increasing the size of the breasts, implants are being placed on the natural tissue of your breasts or beneath the muscles of your chest. Most of the women who have had this operation done goes on to answer the question of can I breastfeed with implants relatively easily.<br /><br /> The implants do not interfere with the breastfeeding mechanism as they are placed naturally under your tissue and if they are inserted it might go on to cause a problem.<br /><br /> You need to take note of the fact that any form of breast surgery is bound to reduce the amount of milk you are bound to produce. Some of the methods which remove or attach the nipple are most likely to cause problems and leave breastfeeding a thing of the past.<br /><br /> If a woman has had their breast size reduced still she can go on to produce milk and feed the baby. But the amount of milk that they produce might not be enough and they would need to supplement it with some sort of formula to be honest.<br />Article last time updated on 10.05.2017.

385	141	2	Harmful Effects of Vaping While Pregnant	"The US Surgeon General has said that the increased use of e-cigarettes among young people represents ""major public health concern."" Since a large proportion of the 6 million US pregnant women are young, it is reasonable to wonder about the risks of vaping during pregnancy. This topic has been previously discussed in Vaping while pregnant. Here, I will review some major concepts.<br /><br />The Harmful Effects <br /><br /> Vaping delivers nicotine to the respiratory system and, from it, to the rest of the body. Due to nicotine's well-known addictive property, people who vape crave it. There are reports of addicted users who go to extreme measures to be able to vape.<br /><br /> It is believed that vapes contain chromium and nickel, both potentially harmful to a growing fetus. These are just two of the many chemicals absorbed during vaping.<br /><br /> The composition of the liquids used in e-cigarettes is not well known. They contain flavors and taste providers that may be health hazards to a pregnant woman and her fetus.<br /><br />The Unfortunate Truth<br /><br /> The unfortunate truth is that over half of the women in the US do not know that vaping while pregnant is harmful. Many have the incorrect perception that vaping is a healthy alternative to smoking. This cannot be further from the truth. Vaping during pregnancy can be as dangerous as smoking a cigarette.<br />Article last time updated on 21.06.2017."		2017-06-21 00:00:00	444	m2m
386	141	2	Do Babies Have Kneecaps?	"Have you ever wondered why babies crawl so easily while it usually hurts when you do it as an adult? Babies also quickly recover, sometimes even with a smile, when they fall. Do babies have kneecaps? The answer to this simple question is actually quite complex.<br /><br /> First, we must agree with some basic medical terminology. As you know, bones do not appear already developed. They evolved from cartilage through ossification. At birth, the baby’s skeleton includes around 300 bones and some cartilages. With time, bones develop and some of then fuse resulting in a total of 206 bones for an adult.<br /><br /> Now, let's focus on the structure of the knee. The knee has a flat circular bone known as the kneecap or patella. The patella is a sesamoid bone (a bone embedded within a tendon or muscle) which is exposed to considerable friction and stress. Sesamoid bones are also found in the hands and feet. The femur and tibia hold the patella. A tendon connects the femur and patella from the front and the tibia is connected with the help of a ligament. The patella increases the leverage of the leg by providing extension to the knee so that it can bear the body weight and the to-and-from motion.<br /><br /> Let's come back to the question whether a baby has kneecaps at birth . The baby’s patella is just a cartilage at birth. This will gradually turn into bone under the process of ossification which begins at the age of 3 to 5 years and continues until adulthood (ie, puberty). The bone grows slowly in irregular patches. A final expansion is made at around young adulthood when a firm and strong bone results in a strong, curvy kneecap. If babies were born with fully developed kneecaps, they would be prone to fractures when they fall. The soft cartilage acts as a cushion or sponge, preventing the baby from getting hurt whenever he falls. In fact, crawling is much easier and less painful with a soft patella or kneecap.<br /><br /> So, the answer to the question in the title is ... ""it depends."" In other words, it depends on whether you consider the kneecap a bone or not. If you do, then the answer is ""no."" However, based on your knowledge of cartilage development and the ossification process, you will probably be of the opinion that babies do have kneecaps. You may say that babies do have kneecaps at birth which are soft at the beginning and then gradually become harder and stronger with the passage of time.<br />Article last time updated on 03.03.2017."		2017-03-03 00:00:00	3957	m2m
387	141	2	Vacuum Extraction – What You Should Know	"Forceps delivery is a well known type of assisted childbirth. Another one, less known among pregnant mothers, is the vacuum, also called ventouse, and the act of using a vacuum at birth is called ""vacuum extraction.""<br /><br />Why vacuum assisted delivery is sometimes necessary?<br /><br /> Assisted delivery typically involves the use of a device to deliver the baby via the birth canal. One case when such procedure may be necessary is when the second stage of labor has not progressed as expected. The mother may be experiencing contractions and pushing. The cervix may be dilated and the head of the baby already descended. However, the delivery does not progress further. Often, in these cases, the baby's heartbeat may indicate that his or her heart is affected.<br /><br />When the use of a vacuum is recommended<br /><br /> Some midwifes and physicians prefer using the vacuum over the forceps. This may be just a personal preference. However, nowadays neither device is routinely used. It is estimated that just under 3% of all births were assisted with vacuum in the US and 1% used forceps. Over time, both devices have seen a systematic decrease in use, partly because more c-sections are performed in complex cases.<br /><br /> In the past, the use of forceps was regarded as the only available choice to deliver the baby if labor was stalled. With the advent of sterile surgical techniques, anesthesia and blood transfusions, c-sections per se are no longer high risk to mother or baby. When compared to a delivery by forceps, the use of the vacuum is considered to be much more recent. It was during the 1950's that its use became more frequent.<br /><br />The vacuum extraction procedure<br /><br /> Whenever possible, the obstetrician or midwife will discuss the procedure with the pregnant mother. Usually, epidural anesthesia and, in some cases, an episiotomy will be needed. The procedure involves using a small plastic suction cup gadget that is placed on the baby's head. A small pump produces the needed vacuum effect while the mother pushes naturally. Once the head of the baby becomes visible, the suction is released and the cup is removed.<br /><br /> In the case that the vacuum extraction is not successful, a cesarean section may be inevitable.<br />Article last time updated on 20.02.2017."		2017-02-20 00:00:00	479	m2m
388	141	2	Why Cesarean Section Is Called So?	Cesarean section or c-section as it is popularly called by the masses is considered to be a surgical procedure. It is conducted to have the baby delivered through an incision that is made in the uterus and womb of the pregnant woman during her final stage of pregnancy, when she is ready to deliver the baby.<br /><br />How Did Caesarean Sections Get Their Name?<br /><br /> This is an interesting question that many mothers and even fathers are eager to know. There are several body parts like Eustachian & Fallopian tubes that have been named against some famous people. These have been named against those anatomists namely, Bartolomeo Eustachi and Gabriele Fallopio, respectively. Several procedure types have been named for those people who had actually created them. Some of these are the Heimlich maneuver that has been named after Henry Heimlich. However, both the cases cannot be stated as cesarean section.<br /><br />Clearing some common misconceptions<br /><br /> One popular misconception among the majority of the people across the globe about the c-section getting its name is from the famous Roman ruler named Julius Caesar. The reason is because, there are many who are of the opinion that Caesar had been born in such manner. Even though a good fit, it is actually not true, but just vague rumor. According to Pliny the Elder, the Roman Historian, there is probably a link between Julius Caesar. It states that during the ninth pregnancy month,  his mother, Aurelia had died. Her womb was cut to bring out the baby. But some historians state that Caesar’s mother was very much alive even when he went into his adulthood.<br /><br />Why is it called a cesarean?<br /><br /> Before the birth of Julius Caesar, there was passed a law in Rome that stated women who died during childbirth, were to be cut open to remove the baby from her body. This way, the mother and the child could be given separate decent burial as well as the final resort to save the life of the baby. Probably some Caesar’s ancestor had been born in this particular manner and hence, this family name got associated with such type of early birth. The historian also has not specifically named Julius to be related to this type of birth, probably it was some other relative of his, who was born in this manner.<br /><br /> The truth is that Caesar as well as his family might not have anything to do with the name of C-section name. In Latin, caedare stands for ‘to cut’, while caesus is the past participle. Hence, the  name of the procedure, which is to cut into uterus as cesarean or caesarean section.<br /><br /> These days, most of the mothers have been giving births to c-section babies, due to the easy availability of antibiotics and anesthesia. But there are Hindu, Chinese, Roman, Grecian and even European folklore that state this procedure was conducted on pregnant women who were alive even after the birth of the baby.<br /><br /> Whatever be it, this procedure does have plenty of significance even today.<br />Article last time updated on 20.02.2017.		2017-02-14 00:00:00	776	m2m
389	142	2	Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs - Balancing the Odds	Drug abuse is an epidemic worldwide. According to the World Drug Report 2016, a quarter of a billion people in the age group of 15-64 years used at least one drug in 2014. There were an estimated 207,400 drug-related deaths in 2014 and over 29 million people suffer from drug use disorders.<br /> Among the different kinds of drug abuse, prescription drug abuse is a particularly insidious problem to tackle. There are people who genuinely need these drugs for relief from dangerous and painful health conditions. But then, there are people who tend to abuse these prescription drugs. Stringent policies are required to dissuade abusers from procuring drugs. Overly stringent policies, however, end up adversely affecting genuine patients who medically need these drugs for chronic conditions. Balancing the fair provision and the control of these drugs is an uphill battle for health departments and law enforcement authorities alike.<br /> Prescription drugs monitoring programs (PDMP) have been introduced as a possible solution to this growing epidemic. Having been introduced in North America, Australia and parts of Europe, these programs aim to control non-medical use as well as medical abuse of prescription drugs, most commonly opioids that are prescribed for pain management.<br /> Electronic PDMPs are tools used by government officials that collect, monitor and analyze prescribing and distribution data transmitted by pharmacies and clinicians. This data helps monitor the distribution and purchase of drugs thus allowing the state to keep a check on the drug consumption. The state and local authorities use this information to prevent abuse as well as for education and research purposes.<br /> Unfortunately, though, there are as many disadvantages to these PDMPs as there are advantages. A delicate balance can still be achieved for the greater good if clinicians and enforcement officials work cohesively. Understanding the pros and cons of each can help gain a better perspective of the challenge at hand.Some of the Key Advantages of PDMPs Include:1. Control Over-Prescription<br /> For clinicians, everyday working conditions involve seeing multiple patients every day making it nearly impossible to keep track of a number of drugs prescribed to each patient and the frequency of their visits, should the patient try to compromise paper records. Also, it is difficult to discern if a patient is genuinely in pain or is pretending to be in pain just to procure drugs. Electronic PDMP records can make this task easy by tracking every detail of how much and how often a patient has obtained drugs. This is also extremely useful for controlling doctor shoppers who visit multiple doctors to procure the same drug.<br /> A PDMP will enable doctors to see a complete patient activity history to find out if the patient has obtained prescriptions from another doctor or elsewhere. Stolen or forged prescription pads too can be detected with the help of PDMP which provides an extra layer of insulation against patients indulging in fraudulent practices.2. Control Fraudulent Prescribing by Doctors<br /> In addition to patients, a number of doctors too, indulge in fraudulently prescribing drugs to undeserving patients. PDMPs can help identify any illegal prescriptions being administered and any clinicians indulging in inappropriate dispensing of drugs.   3. Provide Better Care<br /> PDMPs help physicians obtain real-time data about all the different prescriptions a patient has received from all different sources. This can help them find out if the patient is at the risk of polypharmacy and appropriate measures can be taken to proactively help the patient. Using data from PDMPs is also a better, more convenient way to check patient-centric prescription drug abuse as opposed to blood tests or urine transfer kits.4. Gathering Demographic Data<br /> Data collected through PDMPs can be used by researchers to study evolving trends in addiction and substance abuse in different geographies, ethnicities, and nations. This can help develop better education, awareness and intervention programs were necessary to bring about far-fetched solutions to the addiction problem.Disadvantages of PDMPs:1. Increased Pressure on Physicians<br /> While PDMPs help curb fraudulent prescription and procurement of drugs, it also adds pressures to genuine physicians who need to prescribe higher amounts of drugs to seriously ill patients who really need it. Knowing full well that law enforcement officials can't always objectively discern between right and wrong in such sensitive situations, physicians face the challenge of being misinterpreted and wound up in a legal hassle for prescribing drugs. This makes a lot of doctors underprescribe, affecting patient health and causing what's known as the 'chilling effect'.<br /> Alternatively, 'chilling effect' may lead to doctors prescribing alternate drugs that may be less effective or have more side-effects, known as 'substitution effect'.2. Pseudo-Addicts<br /> There are no machines to measure pain and doctors have to greatly rely on patient-provided accounts. There are patients who cannot find any relief from their pain and are forced to try out several different doctors. Such patients can appear to be addicts on a doctor-shopping spree. While such a situation is often inevitable, it would look like fraudulent activity on PDMP records and can create additional problems for already distressed patients.  3. Other Social Issues<br /> Excessive control over prescription drugs may result in an increase in illicit drugs and related crimes. Mandatory use of PDMP could also affect the trustful relationship between doctors and patients. Data security and privacy concerns will increase and newer doctors will face a fear of being categorized as fraudulent prescribing even though they prescribed with genuine intentions, but lacked training.Striking a Balance<br /> While the cons are many, the pros are likely to go a long way when it comes to PDMPs in the face of the rising epidemic of prescription drug abuse. With proper training, sensitization, and mutual co-ordination between healthcare and law enforcement, PDMPs can be used effectively and can be exceedingly helpful in curbing the menace of drug abuse.<br />Article last time updated on 15.05.2017.

392	147	2	Caregivers' Strategies for Mitigating Alzheimer's Effects on Seniors	Alzheimer’s is a cruel disease, and can badly effect not only the person suffering from it but also their close family and friends. It’s natural that those around them will want to try to mitigate the effects as much as possible. In the case of seniors suffering from Alzheimer’s, these are some key strategies to help make that happen.<br /><br />  <br /><br /><br /><br />  <br /><br />Reduce stress and risk of stress<br /><br /> While there is always hope of new developments as testing continues, the likely reality for many sufferers is that they will not see a cure or any easing of symptoms except by the current means. That means you need to think of long-term coping strategies that will help to keep them going for as long as possible.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A good first step is to reduce the amount of stress the patient experiences in their daily lives. They will find it difficult and stressful to continue forgetting things, more and more often. In order to keep these stressful episodes to a minimum, make things as easy as possible. Add labels to things around the house, particularly in areas they seem to struggle with personally. Remove potential stressors from the environment, such as photographs or even people they find it difficult to deal with. The less stress they are under, the more likely they are to enjoy their remaining life calmly and without experiencing violent or fearful attacks.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Safety-proof their environment<br /><br /> A senior with dementia can often be a risk to themselves, as they may engage in behaviour such as wandering off on their own or walking into dangerous areas. It’s very important to try to keep them safe and stop them from experiencing these risks. Make sure to fence off dangerous areas of land around their residence, put safeguards in place so that they cannot go out alone, and keep dangerous items hidden out of reach.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Do this gently, and with kindness. Locking a door and stopping the patient from going outside at all will only cause them to have many episodes of fear, anger, or frustration. Making sure they go out with a companion when they do wish to go out will reduce the risk of danger, and will keep them satisfied.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Hiring a professional carer may help for loved ones who are struggling to keep up with the patient and watch over them at all times. This extra pair of eyes will ensure that they are caught before engaging in dangerous activities.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Exercise their brains<br /><br /> Although the disease may be destroying their memories, Alzheimer’s patients can have some success with using their brains as much as possible to prolong their better periods. One thing to do, for example, is to read regularly. Reading helps you to encode new information, which is an important skill when doing tasks in a number of different ways. This means they may be able to hold onto the ability to find another way around to a solution when they forget something. Though it cannot prevent them from losing all of the ways to do a particular task eventually, it will at least give them a chance of staying as independent as possible for as long as possible.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Caregivers for patients with dementia have a lot to deal with, much of which is very difficult. The most important thing is trying to keep the senior as happy and relaxed as possible. This is the best any of us could ask for at the end of our lives – and unnecessary stress or risk could be very harmful to the patient, both mentally and physically.<br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 12.03.2018.

Unfortunately, this is not always the case, so parents must help kids stay healthy by taking steps to strengthen their immune systems.<br /><br />Feed Children a Nutritionally Balanced Diet<br /><br /><br />Adding plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables to your child’s diet, particularly those that contain vitamin C and beta-carotene, can have immune boosting effects. Vitamin C increases the production of antibodies, white blood cells, and interferon levels in the body, while beta-carotene increases the number of infection-fighting cells in the body.<br /><br />Good sources of vitamin C:<br /><br />    <br /><br />oranges<br /><br />collard greens<br /><br />broccoli<br /><br />brussel sprouts<br /><br />red cabbage<br /><br />kale<br /><br />strawberries<br /><br />raspberries<br /><br />grapefruit<br /><br />snow peas<br /><br />sweet potatoes<br /><br />tomatoes (canned and fresh)<br /><br />red peppers<br />Good sources of Beta-Carotene:<br /><br />    <br /><br />    <br /><br />carrots<br /><br />apricots<br /><br />papaya<br /><br />mangos<br /><br />pumpkins<br /><br />sweet potatoes<br /><br />cantaloupe<br /><br />spinach<br />In addition to vitamin C and beta-carotene rich foods, parents should add foods that contain vitamin E, bioflavonoid, and zinc to their kids’ diets as well.<br /><br />    <br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture’s “MyPyramid for Kids” can be used as a guideline for providing a well-balanced diet to a child. If your child is a finicky eater, talk to his pediatrician about adding multivitamins to his diet.<br /><br />Encourage Kids to Get Physically Active<br /><br />Regular, moderate exercise can increase the production of bacteria-fighting cells and help immune cells circulate through the body faster. Playing outdoors, participating in sports, going on nature walks, bike riding and doing martial arts are all fun ways for children to get the exercise they need to boost their immune systems.<br /><br />Reduce the Amount of Stress in Kids’ Lives<br /><br />Prolonged stress in kids can suppress their immune systems. The best way to minimize stress in children and help them stay healthy is to find ways for them to relax. In addition to getting plenty of rest and exercise, your child can practice mini-meditation techniques and engage in soothing activities such as working with playdough, coloring and painting.<br /><br />Encourage Children to Get Plenty of Sleep<br /><br />Sleep is vital for your child’s immune system to function properly. Preschoolers should get between 11 and 13 hours of sleep each day and early elementary age children need 10 to 11 hours of sleep.<br /><br />To help your child get a good night’s rest, stick to a regular bedtime routine, eliminate caffeine in his diet, and keep your child’s bedroom optimized for sleep.<br /><br />Don’t Expose Kids to Cigarette Smoke<br /><br />Second-hand cigarette smoke increases the risks of respiratory illnesses in children, worsens existing breathing problems, and exposes kids to harmful toxins that can weaken their immune systems.<br /><br />As the children nurse and research paper writer I encourage you to make sure your kids eat right, get plenty of sleep, relax, exercise, and avoid cigarette smoke to strengthen their immune systems and enable their bodies to fight viruses, bacteria and other harmful organisms they come into contact with each day.<br /><br /><br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 29.01.2018.

399	151	2	BraINtestine	"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder leading to motor deficits (trembling, rigidity, slow movement), impairment in thinking and interference of emotional cognition. It belongs to the so-called synucleinopathis, which are characterized by an accumulation of aggregates of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn). In PD, α-Syn is believed to oligomerize in a stepwise process in neurons, forming insoluble aggregates. Interestingly, Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra seem to be specifically sensitive towards these aggregates and are massively affected in their function. Up to now, there is no cure for PD, however, many medications aim at modulating dopamine homeostasis but those medications can carry severe side effects and also often lose effectiveness over time.<br /><br /> Although neurological disorders are clearly associated with the central nervous system (CNS), the impact of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) on the progress of such diseases gets emerging attention by scientists. Several observations and studies suggest a co-occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the progress of PD, however, the direct link between gut microbiota and the progression of PD has never been addressed before.<br /><br /> Scientists from California uncovered the role of gut bacteria in the progress of PD. They looked at a mouse model of PD that overexpressed α-Syn and that shows progressive deficits in motor function as well as in gastrointestinal function. Non-sterile mice were compared with antibiotic-treated germ-free (GF) littermates and several tests, investigating motor function and gut motility, revealed that GF mice performed much better. The colonization of the gut with microbiota was required for motor deficits, microglia activation, and α-Syn pathology, but just the oral administration of specific microbial metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), to germ-free mice was sufficient to promote neuroinflammation and motor deficits, mimicking PD. Moreover, microbiota derived from PD patients promoted increased α-Syn dependent motor function loss in α-Syn overexpressing mice. The observed phenotypes can be possibly explained by activation of microglia cells in the brain through microbiota metabolites (SCFAs), leading to inflammatory reactions, which are known to trigger α-Syn aggregation. <br /><br />In conclusion, the role of the PNS in neurodegenerative diseases has to be reconceived. Emerging research links gut bacteria to disorders like anxiety, depression, and autism already. Unravelling the role of gut bacteria in neurodegenerative diseases might eventually offer new chances for treatment of those.<br /><br /> The study is available via the following link:<br /><br />http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(16)31590-2<br /><br /> Image copyright for ""picture neuron"": Taylor Maley/flickr/CC BY<br /><br /> Image copyright for ""picture intestine"": Hey Paul Studios/flickr/CC BY<br /><br />Image copyright: <br />NIAID/flickr/CC BY <br />Article last time updated on 26.01.2018."

400	152	2	Missing gut bacteria produces autism symptoms	23-year-old Xu Han who weights 174 kilograms stands on a weighing machine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University on May 6, 2016 in Chongqing, China.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Women who are obese have a higher risk of giving birth to children who have autism. Mauro Costa-Mattioli, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, and colleagues are the first to discover that the lack of a gut bacterium is a cause of the symptoms of autism. The discovery was announced in the May 16, 2016, edition of the journal Cell.<br /><br /> Sixty female mice were fed a diet that was the equivalent of eating three fast food meals per day. The mice gave birth to offspring that had a much higher rate of displaying symptoms that are consistent with autism. The researchers used ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to identify the microbes that lived in the guts of the autistic mice. The Lactobacillus reuteri bacterium was reduced more than nine-fold in the guts of mice born with autism.<br /><br /> The researchers developed three strategies to “cure” the symptoms of autistic mice that were caused by a lack of one bacterium. The autistic mice were paired with normal mice and regained the normal gut bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri by eating the feces of normal mice. The normal gut bacterial group was restored in autistic mice through fecal-transplant. The autistic mice were given human breast milk containing the missing bacterium.<br /><br /> The study showed that an increase in the number of Lactobacillus reuteri reduced the social avoidance seen in autism but not the anxiety. The bacterium also increased the levels of oxytocin produced. The bacteria were found to restore the lack of synaptic function in the reward circuitry of the brain.<br /><br /> The study is the first to show that a gut bacterium may play a crucial role in autism. The rate of obesity in women in the United States is now 40 percent. No effort has been successful in decreasing obesity in men or women.<br /><br /> According to the study from the writing website, autism rates have increased as obesity rates have increased in women. One of the problems with obesity is the lack of delivery of the bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri in blood or breast milk. The new research will not cure obesity but it offers a much easier method of dealing with the symptoms of autism caused by obesity.<br />Article last time updated on 11.01.2018.

However, this is a profession that will serve you and lots of people in the future, so the number of options for studying is high. If you’re looking to find out whether it is possible to study medicine in the European Union for free, read on.<br /><br /> Until 2011, some powerhouses of the European Union including Germany and Sweden provided non-EU students with the opportunity to enroll in universities without tuition fees. Unfortunately, governments in these countries have decided to change that.<br /><br /> For example, the Finnish Parliament passed new regulations that introduced tuition fees for non-EU students in 2016 (€1,500 per year). German government followed suit, and that students coming from outside of the European Union must now pay fees of €1,500 (£1,256) per semester. This decision mirrors a 2011 decision by Swedish universities that introduced tuition fees starting from 60,000 SEK ($7,200).<br /><br /> This is certainly frustrating news, but let’s not undermine your dream of becoming a healthcare professional. There are always affordable destinations for future doctors to go. Let’s see what they can offer you.<br /><br />Affordable Destination #1: Poland<br /><br />  <br /><br />Polish medical schools are drawing an increasing number of students from outside the European Union, and for a good reason.

402	153	2	7 Laws for Successful Medical Students	Becoming a medical student, let alone a successful one, is a daunting prospect for many young people. Indeed, being a medical student will have you working harder than you have ever worked in your life, but the experience will be rewarding if you know how to approach it right. People always overplay it when they say that medical school is a nightmare because you have to do so much, and there is a lot of pressure on you. However, in reality, the life of a medical student can be interesting and enjoyable. You just need to remember the following things. Some people may even call it laws, and they are something you need to try to learn to increase your chances of succeeding and having more fun that you have ever had before.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Law #1: Figure Out How to Learn The transition from a college to a medical school can be a shocking experience for you because it requires a lot more investments. The sheer enormity of knowledge that has to be learned is overwhelming, so learning will take most of your time. Very quickly, you’ll realize that your only option for succeeding is trying to learn more efficiently. For example, you can listen to lectures on your phone while commuting; if you realize that you learn better when in a team, join a study group. In other words, make sure that you tailor the learning to your learning style to maximize knowledge retention and interest.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Law #2: Recognize Your Strengths and Weaknesses In the medical school, you’ll encounter some of the brightest persons in your life. Most of these people were at the top of classes during college, and they try to be the best in the medical school as well. This is not to say that should be preparing yourself for some competition but rather inform you that your weaknesses as a learner can be more evident at that point. If some of the grades you receive are lower than you expected, don’t be discouraged because medical school is something entirely different from anything you have dealt with before. Even though this can be rather sobering, the only thing you should be feeling is the desire to work on your weaknesses. As for your strengths, they should be fed to ensure that you go through more ups than downs in the medical school.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Law #3: Develop Empathy Empathy is a great human quality in life, and it’ll serve you really well as a medical student as well. In fact, having the ability to put yourself in another person’s shoes and imagine what their life is like, and what their experiencing. Empathy should not be confused with sympathy. When patients and their families come into the hospital, chances are they are dealing with complex medical diseases. Having an injury or an illness causes them to experience a variety of feelings, including loss of control, depression, fear, and anxiety. If a healthcare provider is empathetic, he or she will realize their needs and how they need to be treated.<br /><br /><br /><br />(Empathy is needed to provide the best care for the patient because it helps to understand the experience of the patient)<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Law #4: Don’t Miss Out the Things Medical School Has to Offer The sheer enormity of knowledge that you have to learn is overwhelming, but you should not spend all your time in the library. Medical school offers a wide range of other activities that you can use to have fun. For example, you can become a member of student government, join various clubs, or sign up for a committee. As the result, you can meet a lot of new people and increase your professional network. Moreover, you’ll contribute to the culture of the organization by bringing your unique experience.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Law #5: Get 8 Hours of Sleep Yes, you have a lot of learning to do. Yes, you’ll have to discover an essay writer in you to complete all written assignments in time. Whatever you have to do, just do it to ensure that you sleep for at least 8 hours. If you don’t get enough sleep, here is the Cleveland Clinic’s list of short-term problems you will experience: Impaired memory Lack of alertness Greater likelihood for car accidents Lower quality of life Relationship stress None of these effects will contribute to your studies, so no debating this one. Turn off the light and your smartphone, forget about the TV, and go to sleep. Remember, you’re about to become a doctor, so keeping a sleep schedule is important.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Law #6: See Your Faculty Advisor The faculty at the medical school has highly skilled and experienced medical educators. They have been through the experience you’re going through right now, so they know better how to advise you. The faculty members can be your mentors and provide you with specific knowledge, ranging from how to study for an exam or how to perform a surgery.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Law #7: Take Some Time for You This one is also undebatable. You should take time to nurture your relationships, visit your family, take a cooking class, or go to the gym. Even taking a walk is a good idea given all the challenges you have to face. In other words, take care of yourself.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Good luck, future doctors!<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 17.11.2017.

405	155	2	What You Need To Know About Choosing The Right Cosmetic Surgeon?	If you’re looking for a cosmetic surgery of any kind, right from advanced plastic surgery to breast implants, you need to be 100% sure of the surgeon who performs the cosmetic procedure on you. I’ve put together some of the things you need to know and understand before you make your choice so that you get the improvements you want to your face and body. So, read on. <br /><br />Identify Accredited Surgeons<br /><br />The biggest misconception among people – surgeons with state medical board certifications are actually suited for performing cosmetic surgeries. The fact is that governments don’t really require surgeons to be specifically trained in particular surgery procedures. This means, the medical board certificate is just a pre-requisite, and not a differentiator. Instead, look for the credible associations the surgeon has with local, national, and international cosmetic surgery associations and boards. For instance, American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS) is one board dedicated to providing education, training, and certification to cosmetic surgeons. <br /><br />Focus on the Niche<br /><br />Cosmetic surgery is a vast field; each procedure requires special training and skills. For instance, breast implants in Miami enjoy higher success rates and patient satisfactions scores as compared to nose jobs. That’s because breasts comprise primarily of soft tissue, whereas nose jobs are complicated because surgeons need to deal with cartilage, breathing passages, and bones. So, after you choose an expert cosmetic surgeon, it’s time to ensure that he/she has expertise in the procedure you’re considering. The duration and intensity of requisite training in the niche, experience, and testimonials from recent clients – these are healthy indicators of the niche expertise of a cosmetic surgeon. <br /><br />Ask Questions<br /><br />When you visit a cosmetic surgery clinic, don’t shy away from asking questions. Of course, you can easily find answers to generic and common questions related to cosmetic surgeries. However, the more focused and pointed questions are best addressed in a clinic. The most important ones are:<br /><br /><br />What kind of after-operation care will I get?<br /><br /><br /><br />What options do we have if the results are not as per expectations?<br /><br /><br /><br />What will the after-care costs be?<br /><br /><br /><br />What are the latest technologies relevant for the procedure I’m interested in?<br /><br /><br />Reputed cosmetic surgery clinics understand that patients will need to understand the nitty-gritty of the process even before making up their mind to go for the procedure, and are willing to offer consultation. <br /><br />Tip – Doctors and surgeons who’re dismissive of your qualms about risks are, really, not worth the risk. Professionals understand the need for patient counseling, and don’t shy away from it. <br /><br />Ask The Surgeon to Walk You Through Some Before-After Photos<br /><br />The sense of aesthetics of a surgeon is a crucial element of how successful a cosmetic surgery turns out to be. And this can be judged perfectly by how detailed a walk through the surgeon is able to deliver while showing before and after images of previous surgeries. <br /><br />A good surgeon will clearly help you understand the intricacies of the procedure, as applied to specific face structures and body types. Also, request the surgeon to specifically cover case studies of people with similar face structure, breast formation, and body type as you, for clearly understanding the potential cosmetic improvements that the procedure can offer. <br /><br />A good surgeon is all you need, and that’s where this guide intends to help. <br />Article last time updated on 12.11.2017.

408	155	2	How Nanotechnology Is Shaping the Present and Future of Medicine?	Nanotechnology is a term often projected in the light of the unbelievable in sci-fi movies and novels. However, thanks to the real technological advancements, nanotechnology is all set to be a real thing. Nano-tech based therapies have simplified complex medical procedures and revolutionized the way we look at medicines. <br /><br /><br /><br />What is Nanotechnology?<br /><br />Nanotechnology is a concept that was first discovered by Richard Feynman in his lecture, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” in 1959. Eric Drexler further popularized the theory in his book, “The Engines of Creation.” Nanotechnology is a branch of science that deals with dimensions and tolerances of less than 100 nanometers; it is the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular and supermolecular scale.   <br /><br />Nanotechnology in Medicine <br /><br />With nanotechnology, doctors can now focus on the problem areas and work towards eliminating the damaged section without affecting other parts of the body. Nanotechnology applications in medicine have simplified the complex treatment methods; the particles can reach the finer capillaries and other minute corners of the body and target the problem causing bacteria or germs. This enhances the effectiveness of the medicine and boosts the success rate considerably. <br /><br />How Nanotechnology Cures Cancer? <br /><br />The double-helical structure of the DNA has a foldable design and can bond with proteins and enzymes. The DNA columns are also attuned to the changes in the human body and adapt accordingly. DNA nano-robots can effortlessly carry out the complex operations for curing the damaged gene or genome. The machines build cages that are responsive to certain chemicals and enzymes. Doctors can now direct chemotherapy at target locations and minimize the risk of side-effects. Another approach is by binding silicon, or gold plated nanoparticles on the tumor tissues to focus laser beams on them. <br /><br /><br /><br />Nanotechnology in Diagnostics <br /><br />Nanotechnology has worked wonders in the diagnostics department of medicine. Doctors can now distribute microscopic diagnostic devices and detect chemical changes in the body as and when they happen. The technology also comes in handy to speed up gene sequencing and faster chemical analysis by attaching quantum dots to the DNA structure. It is easier to fish out the damaged gene, cancer elements or an HIV genome and screen tumor tissues. Scientists are working on creating a nano-device that can track the entire DNA map of the body. <br /><br />Nanotechnology and Neuroscience <br /><br />Using nano-scaled diamond particles are now used for data collection. These particles light up when they receive any information on brain’s electrical activity by converting the neuro-signals to light energy. Nanotechnology allows doctors to delve deeper into the human brain and figure out the intricate patterns in the case of frequent seizures, or other mental illness. A better alternative to the conventional carbon tubes and electrodes, these nano-particles broaden the scope medicine by facilitating brain implants and faster cell repair.  <br /><br />From repairing cells to curing internal wounds, with Nano-therapy, almost everything is possible. With all the extensive research and path-breaking findings, the future of nanotechnology looks pretty promising.  <br /><br />  <br />Article last time updated on 30.03.2017.
