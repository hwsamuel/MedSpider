0	18	2	Very good point of view. But who is the pharmacist that have time to help? May I suggest that the patient himself read the instructions and ask his doctor about the interaction of the drug. If the doctor isn’t interested in helping him he should choose another one. Fair?	Dr. med. Safwat Alani	2018-01-17 00:00:00

10	87	2	"Hi,  I have a question. I have epilepsy. When my insurance increased the deductible for my brand name medicine, I had to switch to generic. Teva generic worked in controlling my seizures. The pharmacy switched to a cheaper generic that didn't control them. I had driving privileges by my physician, but after switching generic brand I had a car wreck. The wreck injured my daughter. Can you please help proving the difference between generic and brand name epilepsy medicine. The FDA needs to understand.

20	219	2	It is really a very good point, John ! And furthermore, lets not forget the following statement; Physicians are NOT a commodity as they are seen through the eyes of the insurance companies. We have to teach the society that in the end, we as physicians together with the patient are responsible for the how healthcare is provided and consumed. Now the insurance companies dictates what, how and when a patient gets a certain kind of medical treatment. And an insurance company is in the end only responsible for MORE PROFIT instead of a better medical treatment....... it is a strange world we live in.......Lets go back to the old values and practise medicine as it once was taught to us!

21	221	2	The GP of yesteryear had little more than kindness to dispense, but his patients felt and sometimes got better. The modern doctor hiding behind a computer screen may show great computer-generated stats, but doctor burnout is at an all time high. See any connection there? Ah yes, his patients are not happy campers either.	Frank Campbell	2017-02-07 00:00:00

37	294	2	Thank you for this insightful article. I am currently working in the US on an exchange from the UK. I have tried several primary care physicians and they all share the same symptoms of a severe lack of time and energy.  I thought that this was particularly egregious given the fact the cost of care is manifold higher than back home. Now I understand the reason (Obamacare expanded coverage for almost 20 million Americans seemingly overnight. Patient volumes doubled due to the unprecedented surge in insurance coverage) and although I have no solution, I can at least have a little more empathy for my less than empathetic PCP!		2017-12-05 00:00:00
