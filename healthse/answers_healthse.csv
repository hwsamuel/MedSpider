And in general, the elderly and others with impaired immune systems often require more frequent dosing of vaccines to ensure immunity is maintained.	2018-02-28 01:14:05Z	Graham Chiu	3
15457	15460	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15460	I think this is likely to be benign.  The OP does not say how long the interval between the injections was, but let us presume it was at least several weeks. When we do catch up immunizations for infants, they often get spaced at roughly monthly intervals without ill effect.  And the mechanistic idea of vaccines seems to suggest that a second dose would have few ill effects.  (There would be very little difference between a second dose of vaccine and an encounter with wild type virus.  The whole idea of the vaccine is that encountering the virus again will   make you sick.)	2018-02-28 03:36:48Z	John Melville	1
15454	15458	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15458	Drug shelf life is usually measured at 25 deg C but accelerated testing for stability is done at higher temperatures as this adds energy to the system degrading the drugs faster.  So, storing drugs at lower temperatures increases shelf life. When a new drug product is being formulated, it is desirable to determine the stability of the drug entity in the drug product so that a shelf life or expiration date may be assigned to the product. The shelf-life is the length of time required for the product potency to be reduced to some percentage of its original value. For most products, this is the T90 or time at which the product retains 90% of its original potency. Although the drug's stability at room temperature is of primary interest, a stability study at room temperature would take too long to be useful as a screening procedure for new formulations. Therefore, such screening studies are conducted at elevated temperatures in accordance with the Arrhenius equation:	2018-02-28 01:00:52Z	Graham Chiu	2
15453	15455	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15455	You are not going to find what you seek, because any list small enough to be a decent answer here would be an overly restrictive diet - you need variety. That said, if you buy: You can use these to create daily meals like this: You can vary this by making a salad of greens, carrot, cabbage, and the canned fish, by buying a loaf of bread and making sandwiches of peanut butter or tuna or salmon salad (this will require some mayonnaise) and so on.  You will be able to eat for WELL under your budget. These foods will provide protein, vitamin C, vitamin A, and fibre. You might be a little low on calcium, so drinking milk or eating cheese can take care of that, though they require refrigeration. You could go out, buy a litre of milk for a few dollars and a small (half pound?) package of cheese and make macaroni and cheese from that (drinking the excess milk) and be in a good place. (Or take a calcium supplement, or buy a milk-based drink when you go out each day.)  If you can grow your own food, then you can have greens every day and do even better. Looking for some references about what makes a healthy diet? Here's  . Here's the  . You can find a lot of advice like this online. $10 a day is actually a high budget if you are only buying food with it (no toilet paper, soap, shampoo etc) and you are not buying meat or processed foods such as canned soup or frozen dinners. For example Amazon will sell me 2 kg of rice for $5 Cdn, which is probably $4 US and   suggests 50g per serving. Even if you double that you would get 20 servings for your $4, or 20 cents a serving. Beans? Dried beans on Amazon look like $4 Cdn a pound, and again you won't eat anywhere near a pound of dried beans per serving. And of course your local Asian supermarket is going to be cheaper than Amazon prices. So feeding just one person on $10 a day is not challenging. Eating essentially the same food day after day, having to cook for 30-60 minutes each day, having to remember to soak the beans the night before -- these things become challenging and this is why your local store sells so much frozen pizza. 	2018-02-27 21:20:39Z	Kate Gregory	1

The harmful effects of alcohol on the liver are in general certainly   to chronic abuse. The immediate dangers of alcohol are often as much overstated as the long time dangers from it. "Often overstated" means portrayed as such from moral crusaders that want to condemn the substance as such. That is unfounded. The liver is usually quite resilient and capable of taking quite a lot of abuse. But consumption of alcohol is not without dangers. Also not for a single incident. Of course it depends. The question does not indicate "how much" alcohol would be involved in that hypothetical incidence. "One/Once too many" can easily kill a human. That does not necessarily include involvement of acute hepatoxicity, although it mainly is common knowledge for acute overdose. Depending on individual genetics, nutritional status, fitness level, other health parameters, a single sufficiently large dose of alcohol can really damage a liver. Adding some drugs – like   – into the mix and the liver gets even more vulnerable. Some overview might be found in 	2018-02-25 23:02:05Z	LangLangC	2

Harm from smoke is mostly dose-dependent, meaning the more you smoke the worse harm you are causing your body.    But if we measure  , cigars are usually even worse. They often don't have a filter, there's higher nicotine content, more tar... cigarettes do have more added harmful ingredients, the list is a mile long, but they're both death sticks.   People incorrectly assume cigars aren't as bad because they smoke fewer of them, but they are bigger and pack more in them. People incorrectly assume cigars aren't as bad because "it's all natural!" - but so are snake venom, poison ivy, and cyanide.    Even those who don't inhale cigars still have risks of cancer and all the other fun stuff.

If the proximal interphalangeal joint can be passively extended, then an orthotic can help. If the passive issue is neurological then exercises won't help as they won't be able to maintain the joint in the correct position when you're not doing the exercise, and you're not correcting the underlying problem.  A tendon transfer operation can be used for passive problems. But if it's due to a contracture of the joint when you can no longer extend the joint then you'll need surgery.	2018-02-22 04:07:13Z	Graham Chiu	2

According to the  , Instead of focusing images on the  , the   of the eye focuses the image in front of the retina. In a normal eye, the light focuses on the retina. However, in individuals with myopia, the eyeball is too long and focuses light in front of the retina.  Although genetics plays a major role in the development of myopia, it's development may also be affected by how an individual uses their eyes. For example, individuals who spend a considerable amount of time doing near-work such as reading, writing, and working on a computer have an increased risk of developing myopia. Although it primarily presents in school-aged children, adults may also develop the condition as a result of visual stress or as a complication of another health condition such as diabetes. Although a cure for nearsightedness has yet to be discovered, several studies suggest it may be possible to at least control myopia by  . An article published by the American Academy of Ophthalmology: ‘ ’ references a   which was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of different concentrations of atropine eye drops for the control of myopia progression. Results of the five-year trial indicate that  . ' ' evaluates the ocular safety of orthokeratology (also known as Ortho-K or OK) for the treatment of myopia. Another study analyzes the efficacy of atropine eye drops and orthokeratology lenses in controlling myopia progression and elongation of axial length. ’ ,' a retrospective study, included   and   every night during the 3 following period. Comparison of increases in axial length in relation to baseline myopia showed significant correlations both in the OK lens group and atropine group.  Results of the study reveal that the   even in   patients.    In conclusion, although myopia cannot be reversed (yet), several studies concur that it is possible to control or slow the progression of nearsightedness. 	2017-11-11 19:13:57Z	Taylor	4

The results from the Sydney Myopia study found that In adults refractive surgery can ameliorate myopia but I'm not aware of any drugs that can do this in the adult. It would seem prudent, especially in at risk populations such as east Asian, and if one has a parent with myopia, to spend adequate hours outside in sunlight to help prevent the development or progression of myopia.	2017-11-11 20:38:33Z	Graham Chiu	2

I can't offer an opinion on your first hypothesis, as I have not seen anything about this in reference manuals. However, your second hypothesis is sound. There are chemoreceptors in blood vessels that monitor PCO2, the partial pressure of CO2 in the blood, Past a certain point, ventilation will be stimulated automatically by the brain stem's respiratory centers. However, low values of PO2 (partial pressure of oxygen) will also have that effect, as far as I know. I think your urge to let air out might just have been the prerequisite for inhaling new air afterwards. Normally, inspiration follows immediately expiration under the circumstances you describe.

For example, say I do a study and discover that most Olympic athletes come from wealthy families, at a rate far more than everyone else. I find a   between wealth and Olympic success. Some people might say "that makes sense, they get put into expensive sports when they're young, their families can buy equipment and pay coaches, and they can concentrate on their sport instead of having to work at a job in their teens and twenties." But someone else might point out that tall people are generally richer than short people -- more successful, get more promotions, etc, and for most sports, taller people do better. Or is it that rich people, who eat better and have less stress, grow up taller than poor people? Anyway, maybe their tallness is causing their sports excellence and is correlated with their wealth. Height becomes a confounding factor. Does it explain all the wealth/Olympic correlation? Or most of it? Or just a little bit of it? Shared familial confounding refers to things like "if your parents are tall, you'll probably also be tall and so will your siblings." It could also refer to "if your parents had a lot of success in sports, they will encourage you to do it too" -- and whatever factors led them to their success in sports may or may not still exist for you. You can try to separate the confounding in the athlete study by looking at sports in which being taller isn't an advantage, or sports that don't require years of expensive training, equipment, memberships, vacation trips to ski resorts etc. You can also look at adopted children, who don't share genes with their parents, to try to reduce some of the "tall child from a tall parent" aspect. It's hard. In your study, you can imagine the question is "does getting a lot of childhood infections mean you're more likely to be psychotic?" and they I suppose I have to deal with "does being psychotic mean your children, who inherit your tendency to psychosis in their genes or by the way you raise them, are more likely to get a lot of infections?" as well as "is there something that runs in families that might make you psychotic   more likely to get a lot of childhood infections?" - either by having a weak immune system or by being exposed to some other agent or by being raised a certain way or having certain genes.

15384	15386	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15386	: That is: you see a correlation between two variables and try to understand the causality that   connect the two variables you look at. If there is a causal factor, but an indirect/external one concerning your two variables of interest then you only have confirmed the correlation, but are not much the wiser for the probable causal link connecting them. This is very often a problem if we like to hunt for monocausal explanations and in reality there are more factors than one influencing the outcome of any observation. If variables A and B are correlated, that's interesting. If A causes B it's fantastic to know. But If C causes A and B, and you do not know about C, it's still a dark box. You want to get to know C and how much iz is causing anything on A and/or B. Sometimes it is not easy to manipulate C, then you must at least identify C and better yet try to control C.

15383	681	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/681	Metabolic rate, individual genetics, cholesterol-absorption controversies, nutrients of the egg, size of the egg, and definition of "maximum" all contribute to ambiguity.
 , but I will also address this in a general context of what experts recommend and nutrient content. When people talk about eggs, they usually want to talk about cholesterol. The problem is that the body doesn't fully absorb all of the cholesterol, so there's no hard rule. What we do know is: Registered dietitian Leslie Beck recommends: However, for healthy people with no medical condition, regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are better strategies to guard against heart disease and stroke, not cutting down on eggs (for   -   of the population). The two studies cited indicate that consumption of eggs does not raise cholesterol levels significantly for about 3/4ths of the population. Each egg yolk contains 6 g of fat and 54 kcal. Even though they're full of nutrients, they still do contain calories, so factor that into your daily intake. Someone who does an average amount of physical activity would probably require an average amount of eggs. Definitely not something on the level of dozens, but even so, giving any numbers would be hard since there are so many factors in play. Eggs are naturally rich in vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12, vitamin D, selenium and iodine. They also contain vitamin A and a number of other B vitamins including folate, biotin, pantothenic acid and choline, and essential minerals and trace elements, including phosphorus.  Before reaching a daily recommended value of any of these nutrients though, you would probably far exceed the daily recommended values for fat and calories first, but it's possible to overdose on anything, so be sure to keep track of how much of these nutrients are in each egg that you consume in the event that you're burning off all the fat and calories. To know your "maximum" number of eggs, you should probably talk to a dietitian.	2015-04-25 00:34:15Z	Dave Liu	20

   and
 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a clinically approved method to treat depression,  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common and well-studied form of psychotherapy, combining cognitive and behavioral therapy. The goal is to reveal and change false and distressing beliefs, because it is often not only the things and situations themselves that cause problems, but the importance that we attach to them too. For example, a dangerous thought pattern might be when somebody immediately draws negative conclusions from an occurrence, generalizes them and applies them to similar situations. In psychology, this generalized way of thinking is called “over-generalizing.” Another distressing error in reasoning is “catastrophizing”: If something disturbing happens, people immediately draw exaggerated conclusions about the scope of the supposed disaster ahead. Such thought patterns can sometimes develop into self-fulfilling prophecies and make life difficult for the people affected. Cognitive therapy helps people learn to replace these thought patterns with more realistic and less harmful thoughts. It also helps people to think more clearly and to control their own thoughts better. Behavioral therapy assumes that human behavior is learned and can therefore be unlearned or relearned and aims to find out whether certain behavioral patterns make your life difficult or intensify your problems. In the second step you work on changing these behavioral habits. For example, people who have developed depressive thoughts often tend to withdraw and give up their hobbies. As a result, they feel even more unhappy and isolated. Cognitive therapy helps to identify this mechanism and find ways to become more active again. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on current problems and finding solutions for them. It is much more concerned with dealing with current problems. The most important thing is helping people to help themselves: They should be able to cope with their lives again without therapy as soon as possible. This does not mean that cognitive behavioral therapy completely ignores the influence of past events. But it mainly deals with identifying and changing current distressing thought and behavioral patterns. As an example, in anxiety disorders, behavioral therapy often includes learning methods to help you calm down. For example, you can learn to reduce anxiety by consciously breathing in and out deeply so that your body and breathing can relax. When doing this you concentrate on your breathing instead of what is bringing on your anxiety. These kinds of techniques can help you to calm down instead of getting all worked up with anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to treat conditions such as depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders, and addictions. Cognitive behavioral therapy requires the patient's commitment and own initiative. Therapy can only be successful if the patient actively takes part in the treatment and also works on their problems between sessions. This can be a considerable challenge, especially with severe conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders. That is why medication is sometimes used at first to quickly relieve the worst symptoms so that psychotherapy can be started. Choosing a certain kind of psychotherapy also depends on the goals. If you feel the need for deep insight into the causes of your problems, cognitive behavioral therapy is probably not the right choice. It is particularly useful if you are mainly interested in tackling specific problems and are only secondarily concerned with the “why.” It is important that you and your psychotherapist have a close and trusting working relationship. It can sometimes take a while to find the right therapist. In the first session, you will briefly explain your current problems and outline your expectations. That forms the basis for discussing the goals of therapy and the therapy plan. The plan can be adjusted if your personal goals change over the course of therapy. Therapy often includes recording your own thoughts in a journal over a certain period of time. The therapist will then check the following things with you: Do I perceive things appropriately and realistically? What happens if I behave differently than I normally do in a certain situation? You will regularly discuss any problems you may have and progress that you have made. Cognitive behavioral therapy also uses relaxation exercises, stress and pain relief methods, and certain problem-solving strategies. Some people already feel much better after a few sessions, while others need treatment for several months. This depends on the kind and severity of the problems, among other things. An individual session lasts about an hour. Sessions usually take place once a week. Cognitive behavioral therapy is offered in psychotherapy practices, hospitals and rehabilitation clinics- sometimes also offered as group therapy. Side effects resulting from psychotherapy cannot be ruled out. Being directly confronted with your problems or anxieties may be very stressful at first, and relationships might also suffer as a result. It is crucial to speak openly with your psychotherapist if any difficulties come up during therapy. The   from Science Daily mentions: Additionally, there are several studies of CBT's long term effects which point out: Immediate crises in which an individual is at-risk of hurting themselves or others are commonly addressed with rapid-acting medication, since CBT might not be fast enough, relative to the situation. Sometimes, the side-effects and other risks of taking medications will out-weigh the risk of that person taking dangerous actions. Additionally,   notes:	2018-02-16 21:28:09Z	Dave Liu	4

And a crash cart was close by. It is thought that it should only be used when witnessing the onset of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia but it also has the unfortunate possibility of converting that rhythm to a more lethal rhythm such as asystole. But one study showed it worked the best in asystole. Presumably because it can't get worse. The energy delivered by a thump in the correct location is about 5 Joules compared with e.g. 300 Joules from a defibrillator.  The number needed to treat is 13-50, but the numbers needed to make the rhythm worse is 2-10.

You can dramatically decrease the number of organisms by using high-dose antibiotics and flushing out the gut copiously, and by copiously, I mean your intake plus an osmotic agent is so high that you have explosive diarrhea that looks like pure water. (It's not.) Even with all this, swabbing will reveal plenty of CFU's (colony forming units) from what appears to be a perfectly pristine gut.  Drinking several gallons of household bleach would give you even less desirable results, not to mention it would kill you.  That's not to say there aren't any animals with perfectly microbe-free intestines. There are germ-free mice, rats, and possibly a few other animals by now. Obtaining them is difficult: they must be harvested by sacrificing a pregnant female, and under the most stringent sterile conditions, removing fetuses from the uterus, and growing the offspring in a sterile environment, feeding them sterile food (obviously processed), etc. Allow these animals to reproduce, and the result is- eventually- germ-free colonies.  The cost is phenomenal. If it were possible to sterilize mice guts more easily, it would have been done. 	2018-02-16 01:42:43Z	anongoodnurse	3

There are a large number of microbes in the intestines, their presence is essential for being able to digest food properly. The lining of the intestines   contains living cells, so any method that completely sterilizes the gut will also do severe damage to the gut. Sterilizing the skin, in contrast, is a different matter, in that case   light can kill microbes without doing damage because far UV-C light doesn't penetrate the skin deep enough to affect living cells. This means that the only safe way to do this (involving aggressive chemicals, radiation or whatever other means) is to make sure the patient will survive with damaged intestines, and that requires putting the patient on  .	2018-02-14 21:20:05Z	Count Iblis	0

(That's an oversimplification of a  .)   Temperature regulation involves the hypothalamus as well, and fever (which is mediated by some of the same cytokine mechanisms) is often correlated with an increased HR. A marginal increase of resting HR is not usually clinically significant.  Resting HR of an individual can change with level of fitness, as well.  However an increase of resting rate by 20, or resting HR over 100 would be more indicative of a systemic inflammatory response; however, whether that's a concerning finding or just an expected effect of your body fighting infection depends on other factors including individual risk factors, medicines, medical/surgical history etc.  Someone who is concerned should review it with their doctor.	2018-02-15 23:15:07Z	DoctorWhom	2
15325	15352	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15352	Facial lesions are very common and the differential is broad. I will attempt to narrow down the possibilities based on size, appearance and presence or absence of pain. Benign facial growths (such as warts, seborrheic keratoses, moles, basal cell carcinomas, cherry angiomas, dermatofibromas, etc., are not fluid-filled, nor painful, so need not be discussed.  Pre-malignant or malignant skin lesions are also solid, not fluid filled or usually painful. Bacterial skin infections (acne, abscesses, etc.) are inflammatory, and present as painful, tender areas of swelling and commonly redness, but do not present as clear fluid-filled lesions. Pus may be present with a bacterial skin infection, but pus is white or off white, sometimes blood tinged, not clear. The exception is discussed below. This leaves blister-like lesions of the face. What are possible causes of blisters on the face? Emphasis will be   and  . There is a difference between a   (usually larger than .5 cm) and a   (.1-.4 cm). Also, vesicles can occur singly or in clusters in the same lesion. A cluster of vesicles in the same area may appear to be a blister. They are different. Before vaccinations became available, the most common cause of blisters on the face was chicken pox. Almost 100% of an unvaccinated population contracts this virus (Varicella Zoster Virus or VZV) at some point in life. While chicken pox is still quite common in many parts of the world, the incidence has fallen considerably in countries routinely vaccinating their young. The lesions of chicken pox are probably familiar to most adults: multiple small (less than .5 cm) scattered red papules (small bumps on the skin), clear vesicles on a red base, or small crusted lesions on a red base (initially just the papules, followed by lesions in each stage)  . These lesions are very itchy. Since VZV infects spinal nerves and lies dormant in the body after chicken pox infection, reactivation (called shingles or  ) is possible. Like chicken pox, the lesions are clear fluid filled small blisters (called vesicles) on a red base. Unlike chicken pox, reactivation most commonly occurs only in one nerve root at a time, on one side of the body, in the skin which that nerve serves, called a  . Also, the lesions tend to be painful (sometimes very much so), and the skin can be exquisitely sensitive. The trunk of the body is the most common area to be affected, but the face is commonly affected as well. The clear fluid from a ruptured vesicle contains live viruses, therefore attention should be directed to avoid infecting others. Contact with certain chemicals can cause blistering of the skin. Industrial strength cleaners, harsh alkaline substances, etc. can cause painful blistering and redness that looks like a second degree burn of the skin. The source of such chemical burns is usually obvious, as the substance irritates the skin on or very closely after contact. The lesions are usually painful and feel like burns. Treatment is similar to that of burns. A common allergen causing blistering is  , the active organic compound that in  poison ivy that causes a form of contact dermatitis. With sufficient contact, an itchy, red, vesicular rash will appear after several days  , accompanied by itching. The lesions caused by poison ivy often tend to be linear (caused by rubbing along the edge of the leaf) or diffuse (on the hands) if one has been handling poison ivy. If handling the plant, and accidentally touching the face or other body part, urushiol can be transferred to the face as well. The diagnosis is made by the appearance, the distribution of the rash, the characteristic itchiness without pain, and the history of outdoor potential exposure.  Impetigo is a skin infection most commonly involving young children, but  it is highly infectious, adult close contacts may be affected. There are two types.   starts as as painless or possibly itchy single papule that progresses to a vesicle. The vesicle ruptures, and the lesion secretes clear fluid that forms the typical honey-colored crust. As the fluid is infectious, the lesion grows in diameter, and new lesions appear near to the initial one. It is commonly found near the nose or mouth, but can occur anywhere on the face/exposed areas of the body. Bullous impetigo forms small to large, soft blisters which break easily. It is not particularly painful although it can resemble a superficial second-degree burn. Bullous impetigo is not common on the face, rather it seems to occur more commonly in moist areas, such as the diaper area (in infants), the underarms, and neck folds. Once infected with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), the virus, like VZV, lives in sensory nerve ganglia. There are two types of HSV, Types 1 and 2. HSV-1 is the common cause of cold sores or "fever blisters", but in fact can infect and recur on any part of the body. HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes. Both viruses are spread by direct contact, so any skin/mucosal membranes directly exposed to either HSV-1 or HSV-2 can become infected, with recurrences common. HSV-1 infection, though it is with the same virus, can have different names depending on the area infected: Herpes labialis (lips), sacral herpes (on back near buttocks), herpetic whitlow (fingers),   (aka 'mat herpes', initially diagnosed in wrestlers with close skin-to-skin contact), etc. Herpes Simplex Virus infections can occur anywhere on the body. HSV, since it infects sensory nerves, is characterized by  . The first outbreak is usually the most dramatic, but it may be minor and overlooked. The pain can often seem disproportionate to the size of the lesion(s). Fixed drug eruptions can occur anywhere (including eyes, mouth, tongue, genitals, etc.), and can take many forms. One form may be a blister. This is called a  . Symptoms may include itching, burning, and/or pain. There usually isn't pain preceding the eruption. The initial lesion can be a vesicle or small blister. The characteristic recurrence after one particular drug or class of drugs, hyperpigmentation  (more common in dark-skinned individuals), and lack of pain or tingling preceding eruption helps differentiate this from other causes.	2018-02-17 05:24:52Z	LangLangC	2

Its main role is to help regulate temperature in the scrotum by controlling how close the testicles are to the body. This is important because a very precise temperature is needed to make sperm (just a little colder than core body temperature). I couldn't find anything to suggest that high-pitched sounds cause the cremaster to contract. However, there is some evidence to suggest that activation of the sympathetic nervous system (the "fight or flight" response) can cause the cremaster to contract. In   the authors state that there is a In other words once the "fight or flight" response was disabled in these rats, the cremaster had less of a response. This indicates that the cremaster responds at least in part to the sympathetic nervous system.

The physiological fat-loss mechanisms work differently depending on your approach. Low carbohydrate consumption can induce 'ketosis', in which your body utilises ketones (and eventually fat stores) for energy, whereas low fat means you have more glucose (carbs) available for energy, until that runs out at which point your body will utilise fat (if your protein intake is sufficient). As a quick aside, your protein intake seems very high. For a 200lb (90kg) person, the protein requirement would be approx 90 x 1.2 = 108 grams of protein.

(  found 5 studies that all showed children can be taught to swallow pills.) Here is what worked for me. Start by buying some candy that mimics pill shape. Skittles, M&Ms, or the like are good choices - they have a slightly hard and slippery coating that makes it easier. M & M's have a "mini" that is very small and a good one to start with. Choose a candy you like to eat. If you're trying to swallow it and failing, you can always just chew it. (For a small child, I had great success with putting out 5 candies and saying "once you swallow one whole, the rest are yours to chew.") Every day, try to swallow one of these candies using the tips above. When you can consistently swallow one mini at will, try moving up to the regular size M & M or Skittles. If you can do this then you can take the majority of pills, though ones without a smooth coating will be more difficult. Painkillers like Advil and Tylenol all come in a coated version that is easier to swallow. Many prescription pills are smaller than an M&M or a Skittle, so you will have won most of the battle at this point. If you have a large pill that you need to take, you can work your way up to it by practicing with vitamins, which come in a variety of sizes and are safe to take every day. Once you have learned to take a large pill, the skill will stay with you and be useful for decades to come.	2018-02-01 15:08:40Z	Kate Gregory	7

Like other drugs of abuse such as cocaine and opiates, withdrawal symptoms are thought to be a major (if not the major) contributor to relapse. Common symptoms of amphetamine withdrawal include depression, dysphoria, anxiety, agitation, irritation, anhedonia, fatigue, sleepiness following by sleep disturbance, increased appetite, concentration problems, and others. I'm not sure why a doctor (I presume a physician?) would suggest that amphetamines do not cause withdrawal symptoms. It's possible this statement was meant to apply to prescriptions for amphetamines, for example for ADHD, but those drugs can also cause withdrawal symptoms. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, it's possible she was referring to a low dose of an amphetamine that would not be likely to cause withdrawal side effects, and describing them this way was a professional simplification meant to reassure a patient about a particular option rather than make a blanket statement. I don't agree with that approach but I can appreciate the reasons for it, if that was the case. Otherwise, the idea that these symptoms are somehow "not true" because they are mental symptoms and therefore somehow invalid seems to be a very old and discredited approach to addition, akin to telling a depressed patient there is nothing wrong with them because it's "all in their head."

15141	15146	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15146	 is an update to the non-hospital DNR, which as you saw in a previous answer has very stringent (and frankly unrealistic) requirements. The MOLST is printed on bright pink paper, and EMS providers are trained to look for it upon entering a house. In addition, patients are able to wear a metal bracelet stating "DNR" if they have a valid MOLST or non-hospital DNR form that states the patient is DNR, and EMS services are trained to treat this bracelet the same as the form itself. The MOLST does need to be signed by a physician, but any signed MOLST is considered valid unless there is a more recent form or there is other evidence to suggest that the wishes of the patient have changed. This eliminates the 90-day renewal requirement of the non-hospital DNR. The one limitation I could find is that a MOLST is not valid for psychiatric patients or patients with developmental disabilities. Many healthy people have DNR forms. In fact, whether or not you want a DNR is a part of an advance directive  , which every person is encouraged to have, regardless of health status.   that provides anecdotal evidence about doctors with no health problems of their own choosing to have a DNR order in place. A doctor is likely to ask you questions about your advance directive in order to make sure that you are not depressed or suicidal (which would invalidate the MOLST), but there are many good reasons for not wanting aggressive care.

15130	15131	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15131	1) What happens to the heart in cardiac arrest? During a cardiac arrest, the electrical and mechanical activity is compromised (either one or both) such that the heart does not pump blood sufficiently to sustain life. This can be either due to an abnormal electrical rhythm, such as ventricular fibrillation, or a condition such as hypovolemic shock where the preload of the heart (the volume of blood in the chambers prior to the start of a contraction) is insufficient to have a useful amount of normal blood flow. 2) Why is an AED useful? An automated external defibrillator is useful for two abnormal heart rhythms: pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The shock from an AED essentially resets the electrical system of the heart in hope that it will resume normal activity afterwards. In many cases, this may work. The reason that an AED is not the cure-all for cardiac arrest is that there are many reasons for someone to go into an abnormal rhythm and only rarely are abnormal rhythms an isolated problem by themselves. Typically, someone goes into ventricular fibrillation because they are having a heart attack. Only by opening up the artery that has been blocked in a cardiac catheterization suite can the inciting event be treated. Shocking the patient may get them back to a normal rhythm for some time but until the blockage is fixed or the tissue beyond the blockage is completely dead and therefore electrically inert they will go back into the abnormal rhythm. I remember one patient whom I had flown to the cath lab who was shocked 13 times, the last time being in the hallway prior to the doors of the cath lab. Once the blocked artery was opened he stopped going into abnormal rhythms. 3) Does CPR do something else? In some cases, the heart can mechanically be defibrillated. The old "precordial thump", which was taught to those of us with grey hair back when advanced cardiovascular life support was a 3 full day class, can (every once in a while) shock the heart enough for return of spontaneous circulation. There is a reason it is no longer taught, along with "cough CPR" not being mentioned. CPR, at best, produces maybe one third of normal cardiac output. It can support oxygenation of vital organs and prevent clinical death (pulselessness and apnea) from becoming biologic death (dead beyond any hope of resuscitation). A hypoxic heart is not likely to have enough oxygen for normal electrical function. It doesn't make sense to try to zap someone into oblivion without at least giving them a fighting chance with CPR. This is the reason for the old "shock first" with witnessed arrest and "shock fast" with unwitnessed arrest strategies that I believe were put into the ACLS protocols maybe around the year 2000. 4) Pacemakers Defibrillation and cardioversion are distinctly different from internal or external pacemakers. Think of defibrillation and cardioversion as a sledgehammer and a temporary transvenous pacemaker as a jeweler's hammer. Ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia require a big whack. Really big. Sometimes two distinct defibrillator units at the same time big ("dual simultaneous defibrillation" - google scholar it, it's neat stuff). However, getting the heart to beat in an organized manner requires a much more gentle touch. We are talking 200 Joules of a big whack versus 0.2 mA of pacing current the last time I had floated a wire in someone's heart. Pacing is a firm but gentle zap. It gets the electrical system to beat but orders of magnitude less than what is required to reset the system from V-fib. Finally, there is no "slight" ventricular fibrillation. That's an all or nothing rhythm. The reason that "cough CPR" is still useful to those of us board-certified in emergency medicine is that we have toys the majority of the population does not know how to use. Consciousness can be maintained many seconds beyond cardiac arrest. If I have you on a cardiac monitor and you go into asystole in front of me, I can likely keep you conscious for a minute or longer if you actually obey my instructions for cough CPR.	2018-01-28 06:17:34Z	RudyB	2

15123	15124	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15124	This is a great question, an area of active debate, and a personal interest of mine. I actually just did a presentation on this, so this answer will probably have more information in it than you need, but I'll add it for completeness. The first important thing to know about fever is that it is something your body initiates when you get certain types of infections. It is not a direct consequence of the bacteria or viruses themselves.  -- essentially turning up the thermostat. This is important because it seems to indicate an evolved response-- perhaps there is an evolutionary advantage to a fever in the setting of infection.  , so this idea makes sense. Many papers have been published on the effect of fever on infection-- here are just a few: In critically ill patients (my area of interest), there have been several interesting studies. In   (RCT) from 2005, they compared mortality in ICU patients where fevers were controlled with acetaminophen/ paracetamol and where fevers were not controlled. They actually had to stop the trial early because death rates in the group getting acetaminophen/ paracetamol were much higher.  (not randomized) from 2012 looked at over 1400 critically ill patients, and found that treating fever doubled the mortality rate. , which included 11 studies, found a "trend towards higher mortality for aggressive treatment" of fever, though their p-value (how likely it is their findings are due to chance) was 0.09, which is higher than the 0.05 that is traditionally used as the cutoff for statistical significance. , which included 16 studies and a total of about 20,000 critically ill patients, found less dramatic results-- essentially concluding that it makes no difference if you treat a fever or not. Most of the studies done here are in critically ill patients, with mortality as the final endpoint. You can make a case that in those patients, you may be better off not treating fever, since you want to keep them alive. . These have low mortality rates, and so rather than trying to lower mortality,  . And it sucks to have a fever. So for most people who do not need to get admitted to the hospital, treating a fever is a tradeoff between potentially getting better faster (an UNPROVEN benefit, as far as I could find), and not having a fever. If a person is willing to sweat it out with the hope that the disease will run its course faster, that's perfectly reasonable. And if they are ok with the disease taking a little longer to clear from the body as long as they aren't sweating, shaking, and burning up, that makes a lot of sense too. I should also note that there are times when a fever IS extremely dangerous-- if it's over about 106 it can lead to brain damage. All of the studies in humans treated fever if it went above about 104 degrees.  You are onto something! There is a lot of data out there that supports the hypothesis that treating fever is bad for you (or at least not any different from doing nothing).	2018-01-26 23:21:31Z	Nate	6

First off, I'd be careful with the sources you are citing-- one of them is an opinion letter in a journal, and two are studies in rats. When looking at studies, the best evidence is that with patient-centered outcomes (5). Increased dentate gyrus neurogenesis or HGH production are interesting results, but it's unclear that those translate into meaningful benefits for you. The papers that are worth changing your daily habits for are the ones that look at endpoints that are meaningful to you: weight loss, increased survival, improved memory, etc. While you can theorize a link between neurogenesis or HGH and a meaningful outcome, science is full of theoretical connections that turned out not to exist in real life. 
There is not yet great evidence on the topic, as you mentioned, but there is a decent review published in 2014 comparing calorie restriction (CR) diets with intermittent fasting or alternate day fasting (IF/ADF) diets. It concludes (emphasis mine): So while intermittent fasting may not cause as much weight loss as a typical diet, it seems to be similarly good at eliminating fat. There are several studies out there that look at intermittent fasting and weight loss, but they all have small sample sizes (n<110) and most of them involve women only, so it's hard to extrapolate much from them. However most of them say that the two dietary approaches seem to be similar in terms of weight loss (2-4). Overall, it looks like intermittent fasting has comparable effects on weight and blood sugar as traditional calorie-restrictive diets. References:	2018-01-25 16:45:28Z	Nate	2

Since S. aureus is a normal part of our microbiome,  , namely trouble swallowing, sore throat, fever, and pus coming from the tonsils (4).

Taking the cited value of 40%-60% from the CDC, we can say that it might be a coin toss for you   to be protected from influenza by the shot. However, if many thousands of people take the flu shot, even if it only works on 40% of them, it helps protect the remaining population from the spread of the virus (AKA herd immunity). This is especially important to those within the population who cannot access the shot or cannot receive it due to a preexisting medical condition. As Graham Chiu's answer points out, influenza is no joke, especially for vulnerable members of the population (such as the elderly or people with certain medical conditions). With regards to mercury in the flu shot, the specific additive is called "Thimerosal". Firstly:  . If you feel strongly about it, ask your pharmacist for a vaccine that doesn't contain Thimerosal. The additive is a   to prevent bacteria or fungi from growing in multi-dose vials containing the influenza vaccine. For explanations as to why you don't need to worry about Thimerosal, see the   great   below. Some further information to put your mind at ease. In their   in Scientific American, Matthew F. Daly and Jason M. Glanz (a pediatrician and epidemiologist respectively at Kaiser Permanente's Institute for Health Research in Denver) have this to say about the safety of vaccines: From the same article: As a final note: in that article shared by the OP there are several scientifically unsound arguments and factual errors. I'm not going through the effort of refuting them all here. It is however worth pointing out that the presence of Thimerosal in vaccines is not a secret, and is well known among the scientific and medical community. In a   search of medical literature in the medical science database   (free to the public, by the way) with the search terms "influenza vaccine safety" I could find no results making any claims about adverse side effects due to Thimerosal. In a database containing literally millions of independent, peer-reviewed medical scientific publications, you will be hard pressed to find any supporting the claims made in the aforementioned article shared by the OP. In fact, this   (where researchers summarize the results of 190 other sources on vaccine safety) had this to say on the topic of vaccine safety [paraphrased by me]: In other words, infants who have problems breathing might be more significantly affected by allergic reactions or congestion. That's all they have to say about flu vaccine side effects (regardless of whether they contain Thimerosal). Finally, a direct quote from the conclusion:	2018-01-23 05:36:17Z	StrConDexWisIntCha	57

By contrast, influenza (and potentially also gastroenteritis) is a serious, and potentially deadly, disease. Its symptoms vary but  . In a word, you’ll feel rotten for the better part of a week. In addition, the mortality may not   very high but (even ignoring that it caused the   in human history)  . In fact, the numbers vary greatly with each season, from about 3,000 to almost 50,000.

This prevents the flu’s spread and protects other, less healthy people, from dying from the flu. Even a 40% risk reduction is very effective. It’s maybe not considered “highly effective”   because vaccines, in general, are extremely effective. But compared to other remedies, vaccines are one of the most effective treatment methods. Rather than thinking of 40%–60% as a coin toss, think of it this way: amongst the vaccinated population, the   is more than halved (due to the compounding effect of reduced risk of infection in the population). This is impressive. This is intentionally deceptive:   (and never have)!   flu vaccines contain   (or “thimerosal”), which in turn contains  . Despite its name, this is a different compound, and does not have the same chemical properties as elementary mercury.  Contrary to what   claims, thiomersal in vaccines is safe: it has never been found to produce a negative effect in humans. Beware of your news sources:   that lies to sell ineffective, unregulated, and potentially harmful supplements. When researching health topics, always cross-reference your information with respectable sources such as the WHO, the NHS or the CDC.

Some young people can die   of the flu infection from the latter reason.   And if we just look at   we can see that for the age range 18-49, the rate of 41/100,000 is under half that of the average but twice higher than age range 5-17 years.

Herd immunity is a proportional to the product of vaccine efficacy, and the vaccination rate. Here's a simplified visualization of herd immunity, which I think presumes 100% vaccine efficacy. We can compensate for lower vaccine efficacy by increasing the vaccination rate.

That said, the article you've linked to does indeed present some very scary points, and I fully understand why reading something like that would give you some doubts about your own safety, so I'd like to directly tackle the key point raised by it. I have no medical qualifications whatsoever, so just like you I'm reading the information that's available as a lay person. Injecting a syringe full of mercury into your body is definitely a  . The article is mostly worried about Thimerosal, which is used as a preservative. The US National Toxicology Department has tested this ingredient in response to fears, and you can see the results  . It tells us the following: The LD50 being 98mg/kg means that, to have a 50% chance of killing a rat that weighs one kilogram, you'll need to inject 98mg of Thimerosal. Looking at  , 400g for a rat's weight seems like a reasonable estimate, so it'll take about 40mg of Thimerosal to have a 50% chance of killing a pet rat. Heading back to your article: Yep, it absolutely does. Converting the units, 50mcg=0.05mg. If we want to kill that rat from Thimerosal poisoning, we'd need to inject it with 800 of these flu shots. I'm going to re-state this in big text just in case you're only skimming: You're probably a lot bigger than your average lab rat, so we're talking tens of thousands of flu shots before the mercury inside it starts getting dangerous. The article also discusses formaldehyde, and if you're interested you can do your own research into the toxicity of that and see how many flu shots you'd need to be in danger of death from formaldahyde poisoning. It's a real shame that the articles trying to tell you vaccines are dangerous are so exciting to read, whilst articles describing actual scientific research are so dry and boring. You can see why ideas like this gain so much traction - it's terribly exciting to read! Unfortunately, it just doesn't stand up to any serious scrutiny.	2018-01-23 13:35:20Z	ymbirtt	10

Unfortunately, viruses like the flu are able to combine and recombine their genes almost endlessly, meaning that they end up with different proteins on their outer coat. Those proteins are the way that our body recognizes the virus as a foreign invader, and so a different type of protein means that our body doesn't recognize the virus. The flu vaccine each year essentially tries to expose your body to proteins from many of the emerging strains of flu, in order to reduce the chances of you getting infected. Because there are so many strains of the flu, though, the vaccine is only effective at preventing about 60% of cases (still a huge accomplishment!). However it's also important to note that immunity to many diseases is not forever. Some diseases, or vaccines against diseases (for complicated reasons) cause a shorter period of immunity. In other words, the body "forgets" the exposure sooner. That's why you should get regular tetanus booster vaccines, for example. While it's possible to lose immunity, most colds or cases of the flu come from mutations in the virus that our body can't recognize.	2018-01-23 13:58:41Z	Nate	2

Anti-reflection coating: The coating creates two reflections (on each side of the coating) that destructively interfere (cancel each other out), thus reducing the amount of blue (high energy) light reaching the eyes. This is the reason why the coating is promoted to help alleviate eye strain from computer light.  Physics behind the image: 
Index refraction of coating is somewhere between air (~1) and glass (~1.5); the coating's thickness is around 1/4*light's wavelength (number varies, but should be around blue/green area of light spectrum).  From what I can tell, there doesn't seem to be any negative impact on vision/eye health by reducing the amount of blue light that reaches your eye.

So they both augment (additive) the effect of depressing the CNS, which can lead to unconsciousness or even a coma. Also, both substances can be abused, which can lead to increasing (again, additive effect) damages in health (liver,kidney,mental state) and relationships.  In regards to your question of the synergistic/multiplicative effect, there have been pharmacological studies (See References for more information) studying the interactions between alcohol and psychiatric drugs (including benzodiazepines). Interestingly, the effect has some dependence on whether or not an individual is a chronic alcohol consumer. 
From the paper: 
 So acute ethanol intake is correlated with decreased clearance of the benzodiazepine, which means it multiplies the effect by helping the benzodiazepine inhabit the body longer. The reverse effect can be seen for a chronic alcohol consumer.  A hint of the more detailed biochemical explanation: "Highly bound drugs with low intrinsic hepatic clearance are among those most commonly reported to have their kinetics altered by ethanol (e.g. benzodiazepines, phenytoin, tolbutamide and warfarin)."

So, when you have a PA chest x-ray ( or dorsoventral view for a dog ) the x-rays enter the posterior surface, exit the anterior surface to hit the imaging surface.  This used to be x-ray film. So, the right side of the chest appears on the right of the film, and the left side on the left.  But the sides are switched so you actually read the films as though looking from the anterior side of the patient i.e. facing the patient. When taking an AP film, the patient is positioned so that the posterior surface is now closest to the film, and the patient's left is on the left of the film. And that's the way the film is read, from the front. I've noticed some DV images of animals are not switched so that the R is on the left but apparently most are.  But I'm guessing that vets also read DV and VD images of the thorax as though facing the ventral surface.

The child then gets a functional H gene from the other parent and this then exposes the A or B gene from the mother.   What actually happens is that the A or B gene code for proteins that turn the H protein into A or B, and if the H gene is defective, the A or B proteins can't be made and so the blood type appears as O.

Telling the difference between food and poison is one of the most important survival skills for any higher organism. Any hairless monkeys which couldn't tell the difference and ate spoiled food died and didn't pass on their genes. Those who were able to tell the difference survived and passed on their genes to us. This is how humans have evolved the ability to smell if food is good or bad. When microbes do their work, they produce poisonous chemicals. Human olfactory senses evolved to detect these chemicals and respond to them with a strong aversion. This is why bad food "stinks". Similarly we evolved an instinct to notice certain colors or textures which hint at spoilage and find them distasteful. So if it looks spoiled, smells spoiled or tastes spoiled, follow your instincts and don't eat it. But remember that your natural senses to detect spoiled food are not perfect. In an early phase of spoilage, the signs might not be there yet, but the food is already bad. There are certain kinds of spoilage you can not detect instinctively at all. You can only protect yourself from them  . There are also some kinds of foods which appear spoiled but are actually safe to eat (like blue cheese.

This is known as PEEP. PEEP is the background pressure that the ventilator always tries to maintain, whether a patient is breathing in or out. When a patient tries to breathe, they suck in air, lowering the pressure to below the level of PEEP. This alerts the ventilator that the patient is trying to breathe, and so the ventilator starts supplying more gas to maintain the PEEP. If PEEP is set at 8mm/Hg, the sensitivity threshold for a breath might be 5, 6, 7, or some other number below 8. If the patient is weak and can't take big breaths, you might have a high sensitivity, because they might not be able to take powerful breaths on their own.

The shape of ribcages of women and children leans towards what older literature refers to as the thorax inspiratorius - that is, it resembles the shape assumed during inspiration (it's rounder and more convex), whereas the male and the geriatric ribcage is closer to the thorax exspiratorius.  Keep in mind, however, that you're looking at a study with a small sample size. The study linked above speculates that the purpose of this particular example of sexual dimorphism is to accommodate large abdominal volume displacements as in pregnancy. Of course, there could be myriads of other coexisting reasons for it - in males, the extra volume could come in handy during oxygen-expensive activities such as hunting (incidentally, the average female RBC count is roughly 90% of the male RBC count). A robust ribcage also permits the attachment of stronger pectoral muscles. I would always suggest to consider sexual selection when looking for reasons for sexual dimorphism - the paradigm of "men with wide upper body and narrow lower body good, women with narrow upper body and wide lower body good" is as ubiquitous as  and the shape differences referred to in the second sentence of the first paragraph seem to fit it perfectly.

There may be significant differences between the adhesion of bacteria tested in these studies and bacteria of the skin flora, though.

During a shower, soap is generally applied only for a few seconds on the skin before being rinsed.

Using "germicidal water" as the usual shower water would do just that and very likely cause more problems than it should like to solve. However, looking at the "device", a seemingly simple shower head's description: This is quite unclear in how this supposed to work and even though there appears to be an  , prizes and patents awarded, this does actually mean nothing. Nothing good. How is this   to work? There is no energy source, no consumables to replace in this shower head. 
The comparison with   is interesting. A   of this product? What would be the result of comparing this product with an ordinary shower head? Is the water from the waterfall germicidal? Well, water is known to dilute bacteria and also removes quite some smells. And this effect is greatly enhanced if you do what you apparently always do when showering: "use detergent by up to 20 % of normal usage for best cleaning results." This may be a shower head with a good internal design. Without a sound explanation of the functional principles or any proof provided by manufacturer or sellers that all these effects are really there to observe: one of many bogus 
products on the market. Although ironically it is probably not so harmful to your skin, compared to normal water from other shower heads, since it just will not work as advertised.	2018-01-12 11:44:12Z	LangLangC	0
14925	15079	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15079	The concentration of drugs declines based on a property of the specific drug called pharmacokinetics. Here's a broad-brush strokes overview  : A drug with zero order kinetics declines linearly. This is often the case if a drug is metabolized by an organ such as the liver. Alcohol has 0-order kinetics. If your blood alcohol level is 0.8 at midnight, it might be 0.6 at 1AM, 0.4 at 2AM, 0.2 at 3AM, and 0.0 at 4AM. A drug with first order kinetics declines exponentially. This is common in drugs that are excreted from the kidney. Say you have a drug level of 0.8 at midnight. At 1AM it might be 0.4, then 0.2 at 2AM, then 0.1 at 3AM, then 0.05 at 4AM. It will continue to decline exponentially until there is an undetectable amount of drug in the body. As to your second point  : Most drugs work based on plasma concentration. Take an antibiotic: if the plasma concentration is too low, it isn't able to have an effect (killing bacteria), simple as that. Some drugs, however, cause longer-term changes in the body. This is especially common with psychoactive drugs such as SSRIs. The effect of these drugs is to cause the body to produce more receptors to the neurotransmitter serotonin. This takes several weeks to occur, and also takes several weeks (or months) to reverse. In this way, the effect of the drug can be seen long after the drug is stopped.	2018-01-23 14:24:37Z	Nate	1

Martinaityte I1,2, Kamycheva E1,2, Didriksen A1, Jakobsen J3, Jorde R1,2. Author information Abstract CONTEXT: Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are stored in adipose tissue, but the clinical relevance is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in serum 25(OH)D and adipose tissue vitamin D levels after stopping vitamin Dsupplementation. DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind cohort follow-up study. SETTING: Clinical Research Unit at University Hospital of North Norway. PATIENTS: Seventy-six subjects were included after participation in a 3- to 5-year prevention of type 2 diabetes study and were administered 20,000 IU of vitamin D or placebo per week. INTERVENTION: During the 12-month follow-up period, blood samples were drawn at the beginning and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Fat biopsies were taken at the start and end. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in 25(OH)D level in serum and 25(OH)D and vitamin D levels in adipose tissue. RESULTS: Forty-one of 42 subjects who were given vitamin D and 33 of 34 subjects who were given placebo completed the study. At the inclusion, mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 122 and 71 nmol/L in the vitamin D and placebo groups, respectively. Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group throughout and were 84.5 and 73.1 nmol/L, respectively, after 12 months. In the vitamin D group, adipose tissue vitamin D levels decreased by 52% over 12 months. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D and 25(OH)D stored in adipose tissue after 3 to 5 years of vitamin D supplementation may have a clinically relevant effect on serum 25(OH)D level the following year.	2018-02-23 01:06:51Z	Graham Chiu	1

If you suspect anyone around you is having a heart attack or stroke  .  Therefore, another thing you may want to have is  . Knowing what to do when heart attacks, strokes, or other heart issues occur is critical. Discuss this with your doctor, and they will be able to provide answers better than any other person on the internet, since they will understand every aspect of your parents' conditions. After all, your doctors have gone through years of medical training and have tons of experience under their belts dealing with these kinds of situations. Don't hesitate to voice your concerns, and ask questions if you don't understand something.   After all, you may not be home or with your parents when heart failure strikes, so it's vital they know what to do in case of an emergency. You may also want to keep a list of emergency phone numbers on the fridge if your parents, like mine, are not very fluent in English. Furthermore, you may want to consider investing in a cheap but vital medical alert system, like  . These medical alert systems allow your parents to contact 911 by pressing a button on a pendant or bracelet, and a dispatcher stays on the line even if the caller (in this case, your parent) cannot talk. In addition, since you have a family history of heart history, you may want to spend time exercising and eating healthy. Reducing your cholesterol intake and regularly working out makes it much less likely you will encounter any heart problems in the future, although it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility, especially as you age. Convince your parents to exercise and eat healthy as well, but be careful. Increase the amount of exercise you and your parents perform SLOWLY. Don't bite off more than you can chew when exercising. I've heard too many stories of people dying of heart failure when they overwork themselves at the gym. Also, avoid alcohol and tobacco, as both substances can lead to further health complications. Keep track of blood sugar levels if you have a family history of diabetes. You mentioned your mother doesn't want to go through with the operation. Sit down with your mother and her physician, and discuss the operation with her. Make sure to understand her concerns and why she doesn't want to have an operation. The doctor should be present when you have this discussion, so you can decide what's in your mother's best interests.    Most importantly, remember YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Heart disease affects people all across the world, and there is help out there. Your doctor and credible organizations like the American Heart Association can help you much better than I can.

A good example is  .  This effect gives minoxidil two very different uses: the first is as a pill that reduces high blood pressure, and the second is as a topical ointment that can regrow hair on the scalp. The mechanism of action is the same for both purposes (increasing blood flow), but the effect is very different given the formulation. A pill affects the body as a whole and so reduces blood pressure, but the topical ointment affects only a small area of scalp so encourages hair growth in that area without having an effect on blood pressure.

The purpose of bone marrow is (Most often) to provide clean slates (The scientific term being "stem cells") for the production of platelets (Helps with blood clotting), red blood cells (Transports oxygen and carbon dioxide to tissues), and white blood cells (Fights infection). Usually only two to three percent of bone marrow is extracted when donating. The bone marrow will likely regenerate within a few weeks. The donation of bone marrow won't endanger anything (Except   make pathogens slightly more dangerous), and the bone marrow will grow back in a few weeks. It's less dangerous than giving blood. I apologize for getting my facts wrong. The use of general anesthesia may leave you feeling tired after the surgery (Although you will be kept until you recover from the anesthesia's effects), and as the marrow is taken from your pelvic bone, you will likely be sore for a week or so, resulting in no long term damage, posing no risk to your daily life. On the other hand, in blood donation, afterwards you can expect to feel nauseous, and have the potential to bleed profusely if you perform any "Heavy lifting," posing a possible risk to you and possibly your surroundings, if you work in any job which requires operating machinery. Ergo, donating bone marrow is still less dangerous than donating blood.

Head trauma can lead to the development of epilepsy, which is a disorder characterized by chronic seizures, also having catalepsy as a symptom. It may be a different disorder, depending on how the trances present themselves. If you want the trances to be chronic, multiple over time, this leads to the question of whether or not there's a trigger. If you want it to be triggered by, say, a loud noise, it would be considered Post Traumatic Stress disorder. This might result in him curling up in a ball on the ground, or screaming, and becoming somewhat unresponsive. I believe you're looking for Atypical Absence Seizures, during which the person having the seizures stares straight ahead, becomes unresponsive. These episodes are only considered "Atypical" if they last longer than 20 seconds. Otherwise, they're just called Absence Seizures. You'll need to start being concerned if the seizure lasts longer than five minutes. Either way, they're symptoms of Myoclonic Astatic Epilepsy.
Hope this helps!

It will not provide you vitamins, or cure you from cold. TL;DR
But it isn't   unhealthy. What that means is that there are health   you must take into account and decide whether it worths it. Smoking hookah can also be very beneficial in terms of the way you feel. For some people, those benefits overly exceed these on cigarettes, which is one of the reasons they quit smoking, which is a good thing, because cigarettes are more harmful than hookah, but they can also be less harmful than hookah. It depends on how much you smoke. The more you smoke the more the risk increases. People have tendency to abuse cigarettes more than hookah, partially because smoking cigarettes is easier, cheaper and more practical. So, generally there are much more harmful chemicals in generic tobacco, but we will discuss the top 3 most hazardous of them. Videlicet: Not all hookah is prepared with a tobacco that contains nicotine. It could still be tobacco, but wiped out tobacco, soaked in water even boiled, until its full purification. I would still not give my bets on that though as it may still contain some levels of nicotine, which immediately turns it into an unhealthier product. You can also smoke shisha gels, shisha fruits, steam stones and Hookah Creams - all of these do not contain nicotine unless explicitly added.
Although there is insufficient evidence to classify nicotine as a carcinogen, there is an ongoing debate about whether it functions as a tumor promoter. Almost all hookah tobacco (like Al. Fakher, Gazi and whatever) contain approximately .05% nicotine. If it says .5%, that is probably a typo. Nakhla shisha is the only brand that boast .5% approx.
these percentages will stay the same regardless of whether you load a 20g bowl or a 100g bowl. That means if you buy 50grammes you will be smoking 0.025mg of nicotine around 5 times. Note that this is the general content of nicotine not the actual amount, being absorbed from the organism. The smoker inhales smoke, by which the nicotine absorbs. Hookah is something to be shared with a company, so very often it is being shared from 2 to even up to 10 people, distributing the total nicotine intake, but eventually exposing all to the secondhand smoke. How much of the substance you would get is determined by variety of different factors such as how long you smoke, how much smoke you inhale, how often you inhale. Some people think that because of the huge amount of smoke the hookah produces it is by any chances loading you with much higher levels of nicotine, which is not true, because 1. 50% of the smoke being produced is actually a vegetable glycerine and 2. Because the nicotine level will not magically increase, specially for your bigger clouds. Bigger clouds only means overtoasting the tobacco, which ultimately leads to a reducing time of use. At least pleasurable time. Almost all the times bigger clouds means shorter hookah session lifespan. One hookah session can vary but people generalize it to between 45 minutes and one hour. So there is still some nicotine you will absorb, which makes it unhealthy. Lots of people smoke cigarettes for 45 minutes too, smoking much cigarettes that contain much higher density of poison.
 . Adding good flavors only make it more charming and more addictive. The tar is a known carcinogen.
Sometimes, this substance is even more dangerous, because unlike the nicotine, which absorbs in your body fast, the tar does not and it produces dense accumulation over time, that kills the pulmonary tissue. It may also cause cancer. ( )
The process of purifying tobacco removes some of the tar, but not completely.
Cigarettes take advantage of some 3 centimeter filter of "foam" while the hookah gives you a few hundreds of water filtration, which "wash" the smoke itself.
And it works a-okay. As the time goes and you smoke, you can notice that the water becomes more yellowish. Some people wrongly assume that's all tar, but it is proven that it contains so much more, including molasses and solid particles /heavy metals. The water does not only filter, but it also cools down the smoke and when the smoke is cooled down, it is lighter and when it is lighter it is easier for your lungs to aspirate it.
So a good practice is to put ice in the water phial. You can also try one of those  . Manufactures claim that it empowers the water with special molecular level filtration abilities. I haven't encounter scientific studies remotely related to this product yet, but from using it I can not tell. This is what is being produced from the process of burning. It is being released by the charcoal. When smoking cigarettes you are exposed to a direct burning of a tobacco set on fire, which gives you a lot of carbon mono and some dioxide. When you smoke hookah, the shisha does not burn. It bakes. On a temperature of anything around 100C. But, I shall tell you that, the carbon monoxide released from angry lighter coal might exceed that from cigarettes and cigs, mainly because of the duration of your drag. Carbon monoxide might be the least of your problems. It causes dizziness, caused by the blood vessels (arterial) tightening, whereat the heart rate increases to compensate the blood delivery to your brain. To summerize:
Nicotine is in very low levels and density - there is a slight but existing risk of developing cancer and increase of cholesterol levels and even greater risk of addiction. Smoking inside somewhere may lead to a nicotine exposure equal to or greater than that if you were smoking, it depends on the place, its ventilation, air flow and how much people smoke. The tar is in low levels and density, the more you smoke, the higher levels of it you accumulate. Smoking way too frequent leads to more tar being accumulated, which may damage everything between your mouth and lungs and cause cancer. Carbon dioxide isn't risky - it WILL violate human internal processes. Read this:

As a general rule of thumb: consider an Inuit or Japanese gut and body, trained or habituated to large amounts of sea fish, whose owner also   likes eating fish. The equivalent amount of fish oil in supplements might be a good orientation for staying in the 'not detrimental' range.  There is no reason to abstain from fish.

It does have this attribute due to many case reports available in the non-medical newspapers. You see a pattern, you have a desire to name it. The trick of taxonomy is trying to explain this behaviour pattern, many psychological theories stand at the ready:  To properly diagnose a new "syndrome" you need to measure "symptoms", and   to enable a differential diagnosis. One such scale applying the concept of "Stockholm Syndrome" to dating complications is presented here: But the whole process is hampered by the rarity in which subjects are scientifically examined compared to the media coverage if such a case is presumed to be present. That concept is now apparently highly attractive for lay persons to explain counter intuitive behaviour up to a point that Stockholm Syndrome now almost replaced the previously assumed intuitive behavioural response of intense hatred. That is the weakness expressed by different researchers in the question. Psychological and psychiatric symptoms, disorders and syndromes are highly influenced or even dependent on culture. (cf. DSM and homosexuality). At the moment the process of clearly defining Stockholm syndrome as a distinct category that is really sharply defined against alternatives and related concepts is not finished:	2017-12-07 14:47:14Z	LangLangC	2

One obvious answer to give here is:   of the abstracts have to be read, once the papers turn up "positive" within the (re-)search strategy for the literature. After all they have to be evaluated for inclusion or exclusion.  
If the original question is meant to ask for the average number of studies actually used, i.e. a hard number of included papers into the review, then the answer is quite different: From  It therefore depends on how well studied and researched a field or a research 
question is to select the reviewed papers from. Highly fashionable topics with controversy attached will have hundreds or thousands to choose from, niche interests, unprofitable venues perhaps only a few. To request a statistic across all of these fields of clinical systematic reviews is entirely possible. But one of the problems associated with   is the so called garbage-in-garbage-out problem: such an undertaking – of not only "estimate how many paper abstracts medical researchers read when preparing a clinical systematic review?" but even precisely calculate that number – might be in danger of producing meaningless numbers, only useful for journalists or politicians. One article providing just such a meta-meta-analysis does list such a number as requested in the question for the sub-field of psychology: 51 (range 5–81). (doi: 10.1080/00273171003680187
 ) But it also  highlights the problems inherent with such an approach quite nicely: More general we might guard against blind trust into reviews or meta-analysis in general. Currently, the field of medicine strives to rebuild its knowledge on an evidence based foundation, which is of course very welcome. But in pursuing this goal with overly confident concentration on quantitative data and mathematical models, a child in the bathtub might get hurt. Naming, using or just believing in any kind of 'gold standard' (or variously even platinum) will be too much on one extreme side. That is pictured as follows: The biggest problem with that picture is that "the filter" is quite ill defined and regularly studies with higher statistical power or greater significance are chosen to be included. While sounding logical at first this violates philosophical principles, on principle, like Carnap's "  of  ". This mechanistic reasoning introduces therefore its own set of systematic bias. To address several of these known dangers, pitfalls and shortcomings the   is an   to at least standardise the approaches and document transparently the procedure chosen for these types of analyses.

14556	14557	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14557	To get the answers started, though admittedly with a very rough estimation, I'll add my own idea of a lower bound of calories burned to regrow an entire liver. Because basic laws of thermodynamics state that to produce 100 calories worth of food requires at the very least 100 calories worth of energy, an estimate on the nutritional content of the liver itself should be a reasonable lower bound for how many calories it takes to regrow a liver. According to  , raw pig liver has 134 calories per hundred grams, and   has 135. Given the relative consistency, right around 134 should be a reasonable estimate for the caloric content of human liver, not that any of us really want to test that one out. Now according to   referencing a number of sources, average mass of a human liver is around 1.5 kg. Finally,   states that the majority of a liver is regrown in the first two weeks. In theory, this would mean that in the case of a whole liver donation, half the liver would be regrown in the first two weeks after donation. However, whole liver donations tend to not lead to regrowth, with   (unfortunately paywalled) stating that around 25% of the liver needs to be left to initiate regrowth. For arguments' sake however, and considering we're already vastly underestimating the caloric needs for liver regeneration by assuming 100% efficiency, let's roll with it. So 1.5 kg of liver at 134 calories per 100g yields 2,010 calories per liver, of which 1,005 would regrow in the first two weeks, or   71.79 calories per day to regrow a liver for the first two weeks after loss/donation. Notably,   implies that regrowing a liver may burn  , so I'm really curious to see what answer someone who knows more than I do might provide.	2017-12-03 16:03:21Z	TheEnvironmentalist	1

Usually the first cells to die in the brain are  those located in hypotalamus and they start dying within 3 minutes and as the lack of oxygen progresses other brain cells die to. The last important organ that is heart starts dying at 15 minutes. So probably if you rescue the person now and start CPR it will live but with brain damage(the worst here being a vegetative state due to major brain damage). Also another big factor in cell death is the metabolic rate of cells which slows down considerably in very cold water temp.

Clinical death is not necessarily permanent. CPR, defibrillators, and drugs can sometimes reverse the situation. Clinical death is different from  , which is what happens when a doctor declares someone dead. The most likely scenario is pulses were never restored, but they were young and previously healthy so a lot of time and effort was expended trying to resuscitate them. It was quite possibly a few hours. This is a very common scenario. When you read that someone was taken to the hospital in cardiac arrest and died hours (not days) later, what that usually means is the hospital spent hours trying to save them but failed. They most likely never regained pulses. The time of death is reported when the doctor in charge gave up and declared them dead, not when their hearts stopped.	2017-12-02 02:08:56Z	Carey Gregory	1

First and foremost, serious trauma requires immediate surgery, and quite often surgeons with different specialties. A single patient might need a thoracic surgeon, a neurosurgeon and an orthopedic surgeon (they might need more than that but you get the idea).  In addition to the surgeons, they'll also need a surgical team, an available operating room, anesthesiology, radiology with CT capabilities, blood bank, and a bed in ICU. Most smaller hospitals aren't likely to have multiple surgeons and all the support staff and facilities immediately available. It's extremely expensive to maintain such resources 24/7, especially since they would be idle much of the time at a small hospital. This is why trauma systems were developed in the US. These are hospitals specially designated as trauma centers. Typically, they're large, urban hospitals that have the patient volume and financial resources to be able to afford keeping such staff and facilities available.

Modern toothpaste is madness for alot of reasons and the main one is that they keep using fluoride(not even it's natural form by the way,which is calcium fluoride and you very well could do without it) (Main sources from the points below,unless I mentioned a different source comes from this website,which is a database of more than 500 studies about fluoride various health effects(organised by different health issues).  
------Check out brain effect , acute toxicity(dosage) ,etc); EPA itself (but 2004,so it probably is reduced and some subtances banned,still looking for most recent)   Vitamin D and aluminum absorption.  And interraction of phosphate or phosphorique acid,iron ,zinc, and aluminium with fluoride.
  3 Substances are absorbed through skin and sublingual, but how fluoride % or quantity I did not find enough studies yet.  Still compiling studies about how much in ingested from mouth/enamel 3.1 But this study,although in my opinion not the best(since it has a few flaws in it's clarity),is still good to prove the point even more since it has enamel absorption as well as sublingual, because sublingual is alredy proven to increase absorption of many drugs/substances .   I will find more,but this one is interresting because in the application theres no open enamel/cavity area.    " SDF that is applied in the buccal or sublingual mucosa will be rapidly
absorbed into the reticulated vein located beneath the oral mucosa and then carried through the
internal jugular and braciocephalic veins until it flows into the systemic circulation and is excreted
through the urine [15]" -7 Other substances increase absorption of toxins from the skin/buccal.
  
"It has been reported that anionic surfactants like sodium lauryl sulfate can penetrate and interact with the skin, producing large alterations in the barrier properties.[30] An additional mechanism for the penetration enhancement by SLS involves the hydrophobic interaction of the SLS alkyl chain with the skin structure which leaves the end sulfate group of the surfactant exposed, creating additional sites in the membrane. This results in the development of repulsive forces that separate the protein matrix, uncoil the filaments, and expose more water binding sites, hence increasing the hydration level of skin.[12]  " 7.1  From same study ; "Anionic materials tend to permeate relatively poorly through stratum corneum upon short-time exposure but permeation increases with application time.[2] The alkyl sulfates can penetrate and destroy the integrity of the stratum corneum within hours of application.[18] " 7.2 --- So the long term repeated exposure in that sens ,and shampoo/soaps ,are worse,but oral absorption is very effective as well.
--- Will find more studies, but it's very convincing. 8 -And there is so much more available studies to be looked at , so anyone saying fluoride should be used and telling others to take it and that theres no risk,are either very uninformed,biased and naive,to stay polite. Even if all forms of buccal absorption can(depending on fluoride content quantity) be small in one day(although small is relative to what dentist and "health agencies" call small ), on the medium,and especially on the long term it's not small at all,especially considering the acute toxicity dose of fluoride, and the fact that from skin/buccal absorption,alot of it goes straight through the blood or the brain. 9   *** Heres 2 studies about fluoride detox that show Tamarind Indicus food but mostly extract of seeds and pulp big potential for detox,including bones fluoride removal(second study).

Full study     9.2  Full study dogs and fluoride  9.3 The studies contradict themself in some nutrients absorption, but it can show fluoride interraction with those nutrients,especially magnesium. And can be due to various nutritional aspects of the test subjects, such as food and tap water anti-nutrients.

I have known suicidal people who have accepted that they are going to die, secretly say goodbyes, give their possessions away and are otherwise happy with their decision.  Then there are others who are in so much pain that they just can't cope.  Trying to gauge or delineate someone's "depression" is fruitless, too.  Some of us thrive on stress, struggle, challenges and chaos.  I just received an email from a woman this morning whose son was arrested for a henious crime and it destroyed the family business as people in the community alienated the parents, too.  They now have nothing (thanks to "good" people) and are contemplating moving away (where the internet can't get them?!?!?!).  They are very depressed, fearful, have been attacked and vandalized by good-people vigilantes, but, fighting and survival is all that is on their minds, not submission or quitting.   So, I don't think you can identify the person contemplating suicide but, you can be a supportive, caring, loving and friend to all.  If you are that kind of person, those in pain will instinctively know they can come to you. When people can trust you and know that you won't try to fix them, they   tell you everything.  My favorite quote on the topic is by Henri Nouwen: “When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.”	2017-11-24 13:46:12Z	Malcolm Kogut	0

One of these is imaging involving radiation, such as X-rays or CT scans. However, after 16 weeks of pregnancy imaging is unlikely to cause harm to a fetus (1). There are a number of drugs that can cause harm to a fetus (teratogenic drugs), however many safe alternatives exist, and emergency medical personnel are trained to treat you as though you are pregnant until proven otherwise (3,4) References:	2018-01-24 17:48:12Z	Nate	3

Depending on the type of drug molecule and its functional groups, the molecule may undergo all kinds of chemical processes that may change its structure and\or properties. Therefore, drugs (and foodstuffs, as mentioned in the comment above) degrade and decompose over time, and are thus given an expiration date to indicate that after a certain amount of time, the drug's manufacturer strongly recommends to avoid using the product. An important remark should follow: the expiration date refers to  , i.e. the formulation, and not just the active ingredient. It is absolutely possible that the active ingredient will remain stable for a long time, but some inactive ingredient (excipient) in the  tablet\capsule\syrup will have undergone some decomposition that may render the product ineffective, or even worse, toxic.

According to ' ,' Wound healing is not always a linear process, as it depends on multiple local, system, and environmental characteristics. When the healed wound completely restores the anatomy and function of the initial tissue,  However, fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration are not favorable in mammals.  Although several systemic and genomic studies have identified potential cellular and extracellular factors that mediate the formation of scars, the exact mechanism that induces proliferative scar tissue formation instead of healthy tissue is unknown. Inflammation plays an important role in the body’s response to the injury and in all stages of wound healing. Multiple studies show that inflammation continues to play a critical role in wound remodeling, Wounds create damage at the system’s protective layer and provides a new, nutrient rich ground for microorganisms. Advances in molecular biology have allowed for an improved understanding of wound healing. The depth of injury is of particular interest as it determines if a wound heals with scarring or not.  Many factors influence the time needed for a wound to heal… Your "normotrophic" scar type is said to cause the least harm and typically forms as a result of an adequate reaction of the body to an injury. A chapter on Normotrophic Scars in the ‘ ’ states the following,   There isn't one specific vitamin, supplement, or "some other substance" that is useful for the skin. However, your nutritional status in general can greatly influence wound healing, as wounds increase the energy, vitamin, mineral, and protein requirements necessary to promote healing. In fact, without adequate nutrition, the process of wound healing can actually be negatively impacted.  According to ‘ ’  The above abstract determined that  , regardless of the type of wound. In summary, Nutrition also influences  . An abstract titled ‘ ’ evaluated the associations between macronutrients, energy intake, and skin structure in mice. Skin structure was associated with the   and the nature of the effect differed between the sexes. An abstract on ' ' discusses nutrition as related to the patient with chronic wounds. The review provides knowledge of basic nutrition, the epidemiology of malnutrition in the chronic wound patient, and how to screen patients for malnutrition. It also recognizes that ' ' by Washington State University, outlines specifics related to macro- and micronutrients including role in the body, recommended daily allowance, and food sources. This might be a useful resource in determining appropriate macro- and micronutrient related food choices that may promote wound healing and possibly reduce the appearance of scarring. Additionally, ' ,' concurs, Although it is possible that you may not achieve complete scar prevention, the information described above may provide some insight about the role of nutrition in wound healing and scar appearance. Because your injury is located on your face, it is also important to be conscious of simple facial movements, as this may also affect the healing process and contribute to scar formation. However, as with any health-related question or concern, it is always best to consult with your primary care physician or treatment specialist before making any drastic changes to your normal dietary regimen.	2017-11-16 05:28:03Z	Taylor	3

However, haemophilia carriers and women with other bleeding disorders (such as von Willebrand disease or platelet problems, e.g. Glanzmann) may experience very heavy menstrual blood loss. In general the menstruation won't take more days, but the blood loss can be much more severe. This could lead to anaemia and   death. To minimise this blood loss, one could suppress the period (e.g. oral contraceptives or an intra-uterine device). Other options would be administration of the part that's missing or malfunctioning (clotting factor or platelets) or blood transfusion to treat anaemia. * based on the comments below I want to add that it is possible that a woman is a true haemophiliac, but that this is very rare. Haemophilia is an X-linked disorder; because men inherit XY one affected X chromosome will cause the disease. Women have XX, which means that they can "compensate" the effect of one affected X chromosome by the activity of the other X chromosome. She is then a carrier of the disease: there is a 50-50 chance of her son (to whom she gives one X) is a haemophiliac. A woman could inherit two affected X chromosomes if her father is a haemophiliac and her mother is a carrier (and inherits the affected X chromosome). This makes true haemophilia much more rare in women than in men.	2017-11-14 13:57:35Z	Jasper	5

The bone itself has hardly any nerve endings, it is only the periosteum that causes pain. This only works in a few cases. Other options include administration of pain killers.  A few “guidelines” what to do when: Bottom line: To be on the safe side, call an ambulance. During my very first first-help training, my trainer said something that stuck with me: “We humans have two fundamental fears: To die, and to die alone”. While it is sometimes impossible to save someone’s life, we can always, always be with them and comfort them. 
So, never leave a patient alone unless there is absolute need, and if so, communicate clearly that you will return very shortly and e.g. just need to grab an AED. Secondly, being in pain is not very enjoyable, and having a large crowd of bystanders assemble around the patient doesn’t make it a bit better. Try to give them the decency of privacy. If you have already called the ambulance, get a few people to spread out, watch out for the ambulance and guide them to the patient. Hush the other ones away or give them tasks like looking for AEDs in nearby public buildings. Thirdly, lying immobilised, the patient gets cold quite quickly. Make sure to keep them warm. Jackets,  , or a   are always a good idea, even on mild summer days. (Pro Tip: A rescue blanket makes it quite clear to the ambulance drivers where and who the patient is, and it also protects the patient from the watchful eyes of bystanders. Such blankets are usually a part of every first-aid set in public buildings). Lastly, as a patient you are very dependent on the people around you. Because patients are usually sitting and leaning against a wall or lying on the ground (to prevent meaningful damage if they should collapse), their field of vision is very limited. Pain also distracts, so they are not highly aware of their surroundings. 
This is why one must explain every action one takes to them, especially if it includes coming very near or touching the patient. Here’s what you could do (order and items on the list depend on every case, don’t take this as a standard rule). Reiterating from above, always tell the patient what you’re doing. : It’s not likely that you will need a defibrillator, and I wouldn’t send for one as a standard procedure. However, it is always easier to send people looking for   than just hushing them away.	2017-11-12 21:18:58Z	Community	22

A good rule of thumb: the larger the bone, the more serious it is. A second rule: if the skin is broken (the bone is sticking out), it is serious. So, if you suspect a hand or foot fracture with no blood, you can take the person to an urgent care center or ER. If you suspect a leg or arm fracture, best to call EMTs. If you see blood, or the person is unconscious, call the EMTs.	2017-11-12 20:45:21Z	Community	5

If you are unsure, call 911 (North America), 112 (Europe) or the local equivalent; they will instruct you what to do. Secure the accident site if necessary, stay with the patient. Give first aid for any additional conditions (if any), comfort them, make sure they remain conscious, get a blanket to keep them warm if necessary, help them look after their belongings, direct the ambulance to the patient. It may be OK to take the patient to a hospital on your own if all of the following are true: Get the patient to the nearest hospital (urgent care should be sufficient for cases that don’t require an ambulance) or suitable physician. If necessary, they will refer the patient to wherever adequate care can be given. Ski areas often have a specialized doctor in most villages, or even a sports clinic; the same may be true for other areas where outdoor sports are common. From my own experience, most with ski accidents: I know of several skiers who skied downhill with leg or vertebra fractures which were not discovered until they got to the doctor’s.

Drive very slowly over bumps and around corners, do not accelerate fast and leave plenty of stopping distance for slow braking.  This would be my preferred option for a minor injury to an arm, hand, shoulder or foot. In any other situation, call an ambulance and follow the phone operator's instructions to the letter.  Do   try to be clever or show initiative about treating the casualty - you could easily make things worse!  That said, be very clear about the situation and telling the operator exactly what happened and any change to the casualty's condition.  For example, moving a casualty or removing a bike helmet could increase the damage from a spinal injury, so normally this is a job for the experts - but if the casualty has stopped breathing then the first priority is CPR, because they're guaranteed to die if you don't. TBH though, your questions suggest you're asking in the wrong place - not the wrong forum, but just generally by asking on the net.  You won't learn anything useful here.  Get yourself to a properly-run first aid course, learn what to do from people who actually know, and do some hands-on practise so that you can actually do it yourself.	2017-11-13 13:54:21Z	Graham	3

It's not some sort of correction mechanism that turns on and off to make your weight go up and down. On a first approximation, you feel hungry because your stomach is empty and/or your blood sugar is low. People can drink water or eat lettuce to fill up their stomachs, and that works a little. Often, if you eat something very high in sugar, not mediated by anything slower to digest, you will be even hungrier afterwards because of your body's insulin response. The web is full of "foods that make you hungry", "what to do instead of eating when you're hungry" and such like, some of which have a grain of truth in them, and that certainly demonstrate how complicated hunger is in humans. Studies have been done showing that people can get hungry for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with their current weight.

One surefire way to increase TDEE is to gain muscle, as each muscle cell uses much more energy, even at rest, than each fat cell.  When you exercise, try shifting your focus from burning calories to building muscle (and you will still obviously burn calories in the process).

14253	14670	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14670	Personal experience:  If I fall asleep in a number of different postures, I also experience numbness, as I have since I was about your age. If I fold my arms, kink my wrists, place my hands under my head, etc, numbness typically ensues. Depending on which nerves are pinched off, the thumb and adjacent fingers may be numb, the pinky and adjacent fingers may be numb, or they may all be. If I fall asleep on a hard wooden chair, my legs may be numb and I may be unable to walk in a controlled manner when I extract myself from the silly thing.
Research: Unless you do have a disorder, deficiency, or tendency to use mind-altering substances, you will probably have no long-lasting effects from this phenomenon. According to James Dyck, MD, it could be you are actually waking up before your body is. I quote, “...During REM sleep, the brain sends a signal to cause a body-wide paralysis. The purpose of this is to keep you from acting out dreams (which occur during REM). But if you wake up during one of these phases, you can be conscious before your [sic] fully regain control of your limbs. This is called sleep paralysis, and it can be a frightening situation. You're stuck somewhere in between dreaming and wakefulness, and you can't move...”
What seems to me is happening is a little different, he explains what seems to be your condition (and mine) like, “The nerve compression has led to a temporary paralysis (perhaps because you got stuck in a compressed position during REM).” He warns, “Compressing nerves can damage them. The good thing is that the body will naturally wake up as a protection mechanism when a nerve has been compressed too long. After you wake and relieve the pressure, the nerves will quickly come back online, usually first with a pins-and-needles feeling.”
I recommend reading this article in full:
 
If your consciousness is impaired, eg, from alcohol or drug use, you may not wake up until you have already caused at least temporary damage to your nerves.
It is possible that a deficiency or disorder is causing the numbness*, so it is recommended to see a physician if numbness or tingling persists,** and I would say the same would go for weakness, particularly if it’s at all possible to be certain that you aren’t imagining yourself to be weaker. Are you measurably unable to lift or reposition the same items or weights you used to?
If you’ve ruled out disorders, or possibly in diagnosing whether it’s normal or something to be concerned about, you can try the following list of remedies from lovetoknow.com:***
“To reduce or prevent this from happening, try the following tips: Keep your hands from being under a pillow or your head while you sleep.
Don't lie directly on your arm and cut off the circulation.
Don't fall asleep with your hands in a fist; try to keep them uncurled.
Hold your hands above your heart to help them "wake up."
Try drinking ginger tea, which can improve circulation.
Try doing exercises to strengthen your shoulders, neck, and arms.
Try using softer pillows, including a knee pillow, and sleeping on your back (side sleeping can cause hands to fall asleep when they're under the pillow).
If you're having carpal tunnel or tendonitis problems that are causing your hands to fall asleep or feel numb, an anti-inflammatory drug might also be helpful.
Nocturnal support braces for your wrists and hands can help reduce the tingling sensation that disrupts your sleep. Splints can provide support, help you avoid bending the hands and wrists awkwardly and reduce the chance of crimping any nerves.” I personally would recommend trying some braces that keep your wrists from bending freely. If that doesn’t help, it could be that keeping your elbows straight will fix the problem. Either way, the advice will always be to consult with your physician, which makes a lot of sense if he knows any more about you than you’ve described, especially if he has experience in the field.

Constant steady-state serum levels of Naproxen are produced after four to five days..  It stands to reason that the lower the dose the lower the renal and hepatic load and vice versa; the higher dosage requires the kidneys and liver to remove more of the drug. @D Bagnall is correct, however, that the half-life is not affected by the dosage, other than the obvious fact that a higher initial dose leaves more drug in your body after the half-life period than a lower dose. Most NSAIDs produce their effect by inhibiting the production of the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.  COX-1, and (to a lesser effect) COX-2 help protect the stomach from its acidic environment.  Contrary to popular believe, NSAIDs do not "burn" a hole in your stomach. Because of the protective effect of these enzymes, NSAIDs should be take only while symptoms persist. If needed for longer periods, you should consult with your physician. But to answer your main question: As far as your liver and kidneys care it's the dosage that matters. One should always take the lowest dose that produces the desired effect.	2017-11-13 00:08:34Z	BillDOe	2

One must consider two things: the amount of medication needed to relieve symptoms and how long it lasts.  The body metabolizes 500mg and 250mg at the same rate, therefore 500mg won't last twice as long as 250mg.  But if the 250mg isn't strong enough to reduce the symptoms, it makes no sense to take it at that dose.	2017-11-12 21:30:55Z	D Bagnall	0

Some   include antipsychotics, antiepileptics, antihypertensives.  Most adverse sexual side effects of medications are actually just physical, such as inability to orgasm or have a full erection - WITHOUT decreasing desire.  Therefore they are not clinically indicated for intentionally decreasing libido.  Even if you found someone to prescribe it, you would have to then deal with the unwanted effects of those medications'   mechanism of action, and  .   Also, as a correction to your comment, Viagra doesn't increase sex drive, it increases erectile tumescence with arousal.     A person CAN address the psychological aspects of sexual behaviors that they find distressing.  The PsyD pointed out that for those who feel distress about masturbation behaviors, including in relationship settings, it is often not the act of masturbation that yields distress, it is what the person engages in during the act - e.g. pornography or ego-dystonic fantasies - and those are alterable behaviors.  This is actually a common issue that psychologists/sex therapists see and know how to address.  I advise seeking professional guidance for approaching this in a psychologically healthy way, as distress over sexuality can adversely impact healthy future sexual relationships. *This Wikipedia explanation is actually better than other medical sites I found that aren't behind pay walls	2017-11-09 13:34:22Z	DoctorWhom	2

14184	14231	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14231	Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula ZnO. ZnO is a white powder that is insoluble in water and is widely used as an additive in numerous materials and products including rubbers, plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, lubricants, foods, and as a sunblock.  For material science applications, zinc oxide has a high  , high  , binding, antibacterial and UV-protection properties. Zinc oxide can be used in ointments, creams, and lotions to protect against   and other damage to the skin caused by UV light. It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use by the FDA and is completely  . As stated in an article titled ‘ ' the suitability of microfine zinc oxide as a broad-spectrum photo protective agent was assessed by examining the properties considered important in suncreens:  , sun protection factor (SPF) contribution, photostability, and  . In 1999, the FDA issued a notice of proposed rule making that amended the tentative final monograph (proposed rule) for over-the counter (OTC) sunscreen drug products. ‘ ' states the following: In the proposed rule, the agency also discussed the public health significance of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation and the characteristics and proposed labeling of OTC sunscreen drug products that claim to provide protection from UVA radiation. One comment measured the spectral absorbance of three formulations: (1) 4 percent zinc oxide, (2) 25 percent zinc oxide, and (3) 2 percent oxybenzone. The spectral absorbance plots established that These measurements adequately demonstrated that zinc oxide Another comment included the results of in vitro testing of a formulation containing 15 percent zinc oxide in a stable emulsion. The transmittance data supported the premise that  One comment included a spectral profile of attenuation for zinc oxide alone in a cosmetic formulation and from 1:1 and 3:1 combinations of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. These spectral profiles of zinc oxide in various formulations demonstrated that Recent scientific advances in understanding the photochemistry and photobiology of sunscreen drug products have raised many issues regarding sunscreen active ingredients, including zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Because zinc oxide and titanium dioxide have many similar physical characteristics and may be used in combination in OTC sunscreen drug products, the following discussion addresses both ingredients. Sunscreens have been generally classified as chemical (organic) or physical (inorganic) depending on whether they absorb specific UV radiation wavelengths or reflect and scatter UV radiation. Various authors have shown that these ingredients exhibit a semiconductor optical absorption gap meaning they absorb most radiation at wavelengths shorter than the gap (approx. 380nm) and scatter radiation at wavelengths longer than the gap. There are many formulation variables that may affect the photocatalytic capability of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Although the FDA continues to evaluate data and information for the purpose of proposing a monograph method for determining UVA radiation protection, it nonetheless finds As it relates to the frequency one should apply sunscreen, a common recommendation by many public health agencies is to reapply sunscreen every  . Is this recommendation effective in minimizing ultraviolet exposure of the skin during time in the sun? ’ ’ studied how the time of sunscreen reapplication affects the solar ultraviolet exposure of the skin. Results of the study were as follows: The concluding statement advises sunscreen users  Another abstract, ‘ ’, studied whether a noninvasive swabbing technique can detect sunscreen use for up to 6 hours, and whether the technique can detect reapplication of sunscreen.  The study concluded with evidence indicating that the sunscreen swabbing technique is Moreover, the Skin Cancer Foundation answers several relevant questions in an article titled ‘ ’.  Finally, to address your question: “Why do I need to reapply a zinc sun blocker if it has not been exposed to sun or sweat?”; The International Agency for Research on Cancer’s ‘ ,’ explains in Chapter 6:  , that there are other potential beneficial effects of sunscreens that are not related to the prevention of skin cancer include prevention of painful sunburns, photodamage and photoageing UVR-induced provocation of certain cutaneous diseases, and photoimmune suppression. Under certain circumstances, diseases of various etiologies can be aggravated by sunlight in people who on other occasions may react normally. Therefore, if you are unsure about whether it is necessary to wear sunscreen indoors, you may want to consider your medical history and potential predisposition toward developing a disease that may increase the need for more intensive "sun-blocking" protective measures. However, it is always advisable to consult with your primary care physician and/or dermatologist with any personal health-related questions or concerns.	2017-11-06 05:03:19Z	Taylor	5

The FDA approves all 3 products, and the SPF value is an absolute, standardised value and does not depend on type of product. So, using a SPF 30 zinc sun blocker blocks equal amounts of UV radiation as a SPF 30 sunscreen. In fact,  , and yes, you are right, it is a physical blocker and therefore better than most sun screens as it protects from UVA and UVB also. The FDA agrees: However, this is the case with chemical sunblockers. Physical sunblockers do not get absorbed as easily by the skin (The swimming and sweating still holds, though): Nevertheless, both the FDA and multiple interviews with doctors I have seen encourage patients to use physical sun blockers and re-apply sunscreen every 2 hours.  I've read the claim on multiple, reputable websites that SPF multiplies the time you can normally stay in the sun without burns. .	2017-11-04 20:32:41Z	Narusan-in-coma	3

The best way to do this is usually to take a dose right before bed and right after you wake up. Don't worry too much if you sleep for more than 6 hours. Dosing schedules aren't generally down to the minute, as everybody metabolizes drugs differently, so delaying one dose for an hour or two likely won't make a big difference.

In some cases this leads to poor absorption for calcium, e.g. in case of spinach the calcium is bound to oxalate and only 5% of the calcium is absorbed. The calcium in kale, in contrast, has a 50% bioavailability. The calcium in typical dairy products have about 30% biovailability. Another thing to keep in mind when you try to get your minerals like calcium and iron from vegetables instead of dairy and meat products, is to make sure you eat a lot of vegetables. While only a few slices of cheese and small piece of meat is sufficient to get to the RDA for calcium and iron, the volume of vegetables you need to eat to meet the RDA is huge by ordinary standards. The best way to go about this is to include vegetables in your lunch and even in your breakfast if you struggle to eat large volumes in single meals.	2017-10-22 22:08:04Z	Count Iblis	2

I am not aware of any study that would show an association between the mere   of a food and the risk of acne. There is some evidence that   may help reduce acne ( ,  ). Glycemic load = glycemic index x grams of carbohydrates in the food. Glycemic index is an estimation of the effect of a food on the blood glucose level after its ingestion. Examples of   (GI >70) are some sweet beverages, cornflakes, instant oatmeal, white rice, potatoes, white bread, pasta, biscuits and other baked goods made from white flour and little fiber ( ). As you can see, high-glycemic foods are not necessary sweet. Diluting "the sweetness" of a food or beverage may not reduce its glycemic index. The   gives this example (but no link to any study): Such estimation sounds counterintuitive, but it makes sense, because a beverage with 5% sugar (25 g fructose in 500 mL water) usually empties from the stomach faster than a beverage with 10% sugar (25 g sugar in 250 mL water) ( ). So, the diluted beverage passes from the stomach into the intestine faster, which results in faster glucose absorption and thus in higher GI. To decrease the glycemic load of the meals, you can decrease the amount of high glycemic index foods, for example, eating whole-grain bread (high in fiber) instead of white flour products (low in fiber).	2017-10-23 14:28:17Z	Jan	3

   Newton first had ideas regarding spectroscopy, and later on, William Wollaston and Joseph von Fraunhofer built the first spectrometers and discovered the spectral signatures.  As different elements have different spacing between electron orbitals, the energy needed to absorb or emit photons is different and therefore  photons of different wavelengths are absorbed or emitted. This results in a specific spectral signatures of a molecule, a set of spectral lines.  Spectroscopy is really important for astronomers because it can tell them about the molecular make-up of planets, stars and nebulae.   Further Reading:  Red blood cells contain haemoglobin, an iron-containing protein (thus oxygenated hemoglobins are red), which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in blood. The oxygenated hemoglobin is called oxyhemoglobin. 
 Luckily for modern medicine, the absorption of light at wavelengths of 660nm and 940nm differs significantly between haemoglobin loaded with oxygen (oxyhaemoglobin) and haemoglobin lacking oxygen.  Basically, this is how pulse oximetry works. It can tell saturated and unsaturated haemoglobin apart, using different absorption of light due to different electron configurations in the molecules. Below is an extract about the technical aspects of pulse oximetry: The spectral signature of carboxyhemoglobin (hemoglobin saturated with CO) is so similar to that of oxyhemoglobin that standard oximeters mistake one for the other, as multiple studies have shown: Nowadays, CO-oximeters exist that can differentiate between oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin.  : An explanation as to why this is the case would lead way too far. It has to do with the wave-particle dualism of quantum mechanics and a good analogy can be found in  .  : The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency and  and thus inverse proportional to the wavelength.

If you want to absorb perspiration, use clothing. For example, choose soft absorbent cotton underwear over shiny synthetic fabrics. Choose larger underwear that contacts more skin over "thong" or "string" style skimpy underwear. Wear a soft cotton chemise or camisole under your blouse. Avoid pantyhose or other tight fitting clothing that might make you sweat. Wear a cotton nightdress instead of polyester pajamas. Choose soft cotton socks and go without shoes and socks as much as is practical (eg at home in private.) If your feet sweat dramatically, don't wear the same shoes two days in a row: give them a chance to dry thoroughly.

If the person cannot get an appointment with a neurologist, I would at least recommend that the person talk to their family physician, because the family physician will be able to help understand the true cause of these short naps.

A helpful analogy is IQ. The arbitrary definition of moron is a person with IQ between 50-69, an imbecile has an IQ from 20-49, and idiots have IQs below 20. That's pretty easy to measure, and also pretty meaningless. A much more useful application of IQ scores is to try to make ALL people improve their own individual IQ score over time through education. We don't focus enough on the fasting blood glucose level, or response of blood glucose level to ingested sugar  . Instead, we just have 1 label, T2D. Kinda like if we ignored geniuses, morons, and regular people, and just had a single "disease", called "dumb", for people with an arbitrary IQ, let's say below 73. When you ask about reversing diabetes, what you're really asking is, can a person use diet to improve their insulin sensitivity, as measured by fasting blood glucose, and/or response of blood glucose to ingestion of sugar. The answer is  ! Carbs are just sugar chains consisting of 3 or more sugars, so it's useful to divide all nutrition into simply sugar, fat, and protein, and never use the word carbs again. Just call them long-chain or complex sugars, so you don't camouflage diabetes-inducing sugars as nutritive-sounding "carbohydrates". Eating very low-sugar diets (ketogenic, atkins, or even many low-calorie diets) improves insulin sensitivity.  Here are some caveats: If you can make your aunt see that sugar caused her T2D, and that not eating sugar will reverse it, and she carries a powerful enough "WHY", such as not getting her legs sawn off, being able to hike mountains with her nieces and nephews, living a long and happy life, then she will start substituting fat for sugar in her diet, and live happily ever after. Just be aware, it's a psychological battlefield, and the same thinking and actions that got her where she is will NOT get her out. Other Sources:	2017-10-21 16:22:10Z	Narusan-in-coma	1

Inhaled alcohol can dry out nasal passages and make them more susceptible to infection not to mention that here is also a potential increased risk of addiction. Alcohol's bolining point would be very similar to agar's melting point - 78C which makes your idea interesting to some extent. (See   of the process from NCBI.

Inhaling agar however, is unfortunately *not-very-healthy and it can cause lung polyps and even respirator collapse.

After a patent expires, other companies can produce the same drug, under a different name.  In the case of Aspirin, Aspirin is still a registered trademark, but aspirin isn't. But because the drug is so famous, it is retailed by different companies under the name   (lower-case a), which is not trademarked.  The active ingredient of Aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid.

13930	13946	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13946	To "understand cancer on some very serious advanced level" is a major endeavor for someone coming from outside of a biological sciences background.  You might look at it that biology and chemistry are the foundation of medical sciences, where physics and math are the foundation of engineering sciences.  Physics and math are of course important in medical sciences, but I might say that it's only insofar as their role in biology and chemistry. Biomedical engineering is where the two really start to cross over. If you are considering focusing on cancer with your career, you might consider studying Biomedical engineering - but either way, I recommend you take a look at the coursework of a Biomedical engineering degree to see what you HAVE and HAVE NOT studied yourself. If I had to break cancer into fundamentals: when a malfunction occurs in the genes (or "processing" of genes) in the cells of a tissue of an organ in an organ system of an organism, each specific malfunction can cause specific normal histological structures and physiological functions to go "wrong" in specific and complex ways that have specific and complex effects.  There are specific conditions that can cause those genetic malfunctions to occur.  And there are a LOT of things we still don't understand about many of those steps. Therefore, to truly understand cancer, you need to understand many layers of material that are rooted in those below. As has been suggested, it may be easier to start with a specific cancer and start making a list of concepts you need to read about when you find your gaps.  OR you might look at TED talks or university lectures posted online for a video on the fundamentals of cancer, and see what you understand already vs what you would need to learn.  I can only offer a single person's opinion, so take it with a grain of salt, and I am light years from being an expert in cancer. But the first time I really felt that all the concepts fully came together and sprung alive was a lecture in a pathology review course called Pathoma - and that was my second year of med school after an undergrad degree in biology.  That's also when I grasped that there is SO much more to it that I will never understand without dedicating enormous time to it.

13926	14124	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14124	Apart from monks and nuns who showcase impressive abilities Wim Hof is onto something. One anecdote reads as follows: But anecdotes from believers are of course not very useful. Scientists are nevertheless intrigued by all those world records Hof has collected: The same study in a peer reviewed journal comes with more data: : A second study also sees changes resulting from practicing the technique, this time stripping the method of its Asian mysticism parts and thereby westernising it:
 That sounds indeed promising. But in what way remains mostly unclear. "Attenuating immune response"? Well, lowering the immune system's activity might be a bad idea in relation to cancer, putting a brake on overshooting inflammatory processes might be good. Is any of this studied in a larger group? Is any of this studied over a longer time frame?  short time hyperventilation or even hypoxia may have some kind of     that   lead to improved oxygenation of body tissues overall. Doing this repeatedly or routinely may also have quite   effects. But the   'tumor hypoxia' effects of cancer that appear as   under-oxygenation of the affected cells are not necessarily the same as what happens in breathing a few times like the Hof. So, Wim Hof is onto something. But what is it?     has optimised     and   many benefits one can gain from these practices, even in their archaic or   form. Better breathing patterns and more activity as opposed to sedentary life are without question positive changes for many 'civilised' people.  This answer assumes a somewhat mediated approach to the technique. There are always   cases that seem to invalidate a common sense evaluation. Trying to do this in a "cancer prone" individual? The relation to cancer seems currently indirect at best. If you overdo it, and what is meant by that is completely undetermined, it is very probably bad. As Taylor above has found this post: 
  some aspects become quite clear though: 120 minutes sessions, doing in a car or in icy water, and possibly alone, there are quite a number of such immediate risks involved in practicing this to these extremes. How much more likely cancer is due to these exercises if done so often and so long to   stress out and damage the system is not known via scientific studies. Overdoing it will very probably lead to very unwelcome effects, like driving off the road, so quickly that any increase in risk for cancer will be moot. Unless this Hof-method or the tummo meditation are more researched we have to conclude for now that there are many anecdotes but almost no real evidence as defined to our standards that this works either way or better than simply "do more sports". Only indicators, but a few, point into the direction of overall improved health, if one doesn't faint from the hyperventilation.  Being the optimist I await much more studies on this. Until those arrive: I guess it doesn't hurt much, it doesn't help much.	2017-10-26 17:25:57Z	LangLangC	5

As a result, ineffective breathing patterns can cause cell and tissue hypoxia, chronic inflammation, immunosuppression, and many other negative effects caused by low body-oxygen levels and hypocapnia (reduced CO2 levels).

In 1931, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the nature and mode of action of the respiratory enzyme as it relates to cellular metabolism and cellular respiration. His studies led to the discovery that Under normal conditions, abnormal cells are detected by the immune system and destroyed. However, the work of macrophages, enzymes and other agents of the immune system is severely restricted when hypoxia exists. For example,   studied malignant changes on the cellular level and wrote in an abstract, titled ‘ ,’ Malignant cells normally and constantly appear and exist in any human organism due to the billions of cell divisions and mutations. As described in ‘ ,’ ‘ ,’ describes methods that were developed in selecting and analyzing cells from tumors as a function of their distance from the tumor blood supply.  There is evidence about the fast growth of tumors when the condition of hypoxia is present. ‘ ’ gives credence to this notion, stating The abstract also draws a correlation between hypoxia and cancer metastasis:     Additionally, ’ ’ explores the relationship between tumor oxygenation and treatment outcome in human soft tissue sarcoma, claiming that tumor oxygenation predicts chances of cancer invasion. Hypoxia can also affect cancer development, treatment, and prognosis according to ‘ ,’ And in ‘ ’,  In ‘ ,  And lastly, in ‘ ,’ Based on the findings of the previously mentioned studies, the appearance, development, and metastasis of cancer can be attributed to cell hypoxia which can occur as result of extended hyperventilation. Therefore, the Wim Hof method may not be advantageous when included in a cancer-prone individual's "prevention plan" due to the potential risks involved with hypoxia (as a potential consequence resulting from the hyperventilation component of the breathing exercise). 	2017-10-26 01:15:07Z	Taylor	8

On an anecdotal note, I've done mouth-to-mouth on a perfect stranger. He was a young adult male drowning victim. It's not as off-putting as you might think. However, had he vomited, which is common in cardiac arrest, that would have made me wish for a pocket mask.  If protective equipment like a pocket mask isn't available and omitting mouth-to-mouth isn't an option, then there aren't many options left. A piece of cloth used as a barrier might help reduce the gross factor, but I doubt it will do much to protect you from bacteria and viruses. If vomit is present, you need to clear the airway first anyway, which should have been covered in your CPR class. If blood is present, now you have to ask yourself how much risk you're willing to take since you could be exposing yourself to dangerous bloodborne pathogens. Although it's okay to wipe the mouth and face off with a wet cloth, it's not okay to try and rinse the mouth.  Honestly, should you find yourself in the situation of using your CPR training, I think you'll find that you'll be too busy and focused to even notice the off-putting aspects unless the patient is a real mess.

13875	13881	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13881	In the US this should be a very rare event. Every state (or region) has hospitals designated as level 1 trauma centers. Being certified as a level 1 trauma center means they have all the personnel and facilities necessary to handle any type of trauma at any time. That means surgical teams and all the support staff and facilities such as radiology, blood bank, pharmacy and all the necessary personnel are on site and available 24/7. Surgeons being "on call" isn't good enough. Along with trauma centers, there is a system of regulations governing which patients qualify as trauma patients and how EMS must handle them. When EMS responds to a 911 call and they determine that the patient meets trauma criteria, they   transport that patient to the nearest trauma center. (This is one of the few times that EMS can overrule a conscious, sober, adult patient's choice of hospitals.) However, exceptions can and do happen. For example, a patient has suffered massive blood loss. The trauma center is 45 minutes away and the patient is deteriorating rapidly and unlikely to survive the trip, but another hospital is 5 minutes away that has a blood bank and surgical capabilities. In that case the medics would contact their own medical control (usually an ED doctor where they're based) and request a diversion. If approved, they would then contact the new destination hospital to give them a heads up on what's headed their way. You don't take a critical patient somewhere without knowing for sure they can accept them. The idea here is the patient will be stabilized at the smaller hospital and then transferred to the trauma center ASAP.  So the scenario you ask about should almost never happen. There's no benefit to taking a trauma patient somewhere where there are no surgeons since there's little a hospital can do that the medics can't. It's better to fly the patient if possible or simply keep moving. Time is everything in trauma and diverting to a hospital without the necessary resources would be a waste of precious time.  In comments Narusan raises a good question: What if the patient travels to the smaller hospital himself? In that case the same thing would happen. They would stabilize the patient to the best of their abilities and then transfer them to a trauma center as soon as possible. 	2017-10-05 20:21:19Z	Carey Gregory	5

This is partly an   and secondly not a pessimists complaint but an overoptimistic expectation. So, let's re-analyse and maybe rephrase or reframe the objectives first. That "puberty wreaks havoc on the skin" is a   based on time. In puberty certain unpleasant skin disorders may manifest themselves. True. But this is not a   explanation like in "  causes acne". And this is easily evident from the question itself: That "[…][anti-androgen]  […] are prescription only. Almost all of them are specific to either men or women." – Well, having "anti-sex-hormones" differentiated for the different sexes seems  . Men and and women have different levels of hormones. My guess here is that absolutely nobody wants zero androgens in his system. And considering the side-effects: Topical agents may have a systemic effects. If it gets   your skin to affect cells there, it is   your system, almost free to travel anywhere. "Usually, androgens are to blame for these…" Meaning that with certain levels of androgens (you were never free of them, maybe they are useful?) a certain number of people are more prone to develop skin issues? That is one part of a probably true explanation.  is not an   like   where you have one pathogen clearly causing a sharply definable set of symptoms. What is colloquially called acne is better described as a   where many symtopms, many causes and many treatment options are available now and will become available in the future. As it's stated in the question "this is a goldmine". But one mine that is still a bit difficult to explore and extract the wealth from. Among the so-called   for   there are really just a number of factors identified as contributing to the state of unpleasantness. Colloquially:  Hormonal imbalances, oily skin, bacterial infections and: Or in another systematic: This multitude of causes, often found in countless variations or combinations, means that to arrive at "The Acne Gel" with just an anti-androgen in it is bound to fail. Only if a condition is   as a androgen- or androgen-receptor   is there any reason to act upon this alone. Androgens are not "bad". Simply blocking, or yet destroying, the complete signalling pathway for that may yield quite unpleasant results.  "Just removing this one bad guy" is just not an option.
Or just imagine human skin without collagen, you would fall apart to see this: (An important side note should be allowed in reaction to the comment below: the   dependent an   that is manufactured   the skin is what   (well to a  , or likeminded identities), "the  "   in the same place is mainly manufactured by the bacteria   feeding on accumulated waste there. ) "Irreversibly damaging" anything looks like a good idea? Most of those suffering from acne in their youth stop suffering from acne in adulthood. Starting to manipulatie anyones genes without first getting a   better understanding of all the complexities of these processes –in general– seems very pre-mature. While I am by no means an expert in guessing the path of the future, I am convinced that there are better ways to treat acne now and even better treatments – without crispering genes – will become available. If a condition within this spectrum of unpleasantness   to be influenced positively by androgen receptor sensitivity modification then a treatment doing just that (but temporarily) will come quickly. Of course, only funding research into overly specific directions, like genetic modification or topical anti-androgens, may have detrimental effects in the long run.

In Germany,   (albeit the water having very good quality, it is not sterile) and instead, it is sufficient to  mechanically clean the wound with sterile compressions.  This has the advantage over disinfectants that the blood clotting is not inhibited. Opinion on this differs in the U.S.,  .  However, it hardly matters for a minor injury like this. If you do not have a sterile compression at hand, I recommend to use water instead.

Both learn at least a core medical curriculum, then take exams demonstrating that level of knowledge (USMLE vs COMLEX). Both can apply for residencies for any specialty, and they take the exact same specialty boards in order to practice medicine.  Both can go into research or any other branch of medical science, with or without going through a residency. The core medical curriculum is offered in all.  So I honestly feel that what you learn and your exposure to research is highly institution-dependent, and the differences between MD schools can even be greater than between MD and DO schools. (Except that   is not offered in most MD schools to my knowledge.)  There are some generalizations, like that DO schools tend to be more holistic in philosophy, but even that is institution-dependent. Unfortunately, historically, and even still in some circumstances/regions/fields, DOs have had a more uphill battle to reach the positions and recognition that they deserve in this MD-dominated medical field.  But within the medical field, I feel that the vast majority of MDs and DOs today finally see each other as equal colleagues, as they should.    a doctor's skill as a clinician or researcher is more dependent on their individual learning, mentorship and experiences that they seek out than anything else! Which is probably the most important factor for someone going into research: what the affiliated UNIVERSITY is doing.  What research can you be involved in during medical school? What can it offer you in strength of opportunities and mentorship?  I would approach it by exploring the difference between SCHOOLS rather than degrees. Figure out who is doing what you want to do, and who offers the most opportunity to explore what you're interested in.  Then apply accordingly.

The long answer: Preventing acne scars in the first place is the best approach, but there are many methods for removing scars of different types. There are different kinds of acne scars: atrophic scars (indentations in the skin caused by destruction and loss of collagen), and hypertrophic scars and keloids (firm, raised lump; less common; caused by collagen gain). There may also be a reddish hue associated with either type of acne scar. The first step in treating acne scars is to treat the redness. The best treatment to decrease redness is pulsed-dye laser therapy, which targets oxyhemoglobin (a compound from blood) within the skin and can reduce redness by about 60%. Other steps in treating acne scars include the CROSS technique (chemical reconstruction of skin scars, using a trichloroacetic acid peel), subcision (a surgical technique), and punch excision and punch elevation (another surgical technique). Collagen remodeling procedures are also available, which include ablative laser resurfacing, a method that ablates parts of the skin very precisely. Other miscellaneous acne scar treatments: chemical peels, dermabrasion, skin needling, injectable soft tissue fillers, and silicone gel sheeting. NOTE: Do not try any of the medical procedures at home. Talk to an experienced dermatologist. The best way for you to reduce the appearance of your acne scars will be to meet with a dermatologist who can give you a physical exam, treat any ongoing acne flare-ups, and provide you with personalized, practical options for reducing your existing acne scarring.

They have the ability to bind the antibiotic in the gut, decreasing absorption.   (such as the penicillin class, the one you're taking. The clavulanic acid is to increase it's strength against certain bacteria.) If the antibiotic package insert (or the pharmacists's instruction sheet) states it should be taken on an empty stomach, take it with water. But what you eat when you eat is your choice. Some doctors believe that milk products cause increased production or thickening of secretions, and that's a problem if you have a middle ear infection. If there is fluid in the middle ear, especially infected fluid, you want the fluid to drain out of the middle ear via the eustacian tube into the back of your throat. So, the thinking that milk makes mucus worse means recommending a decrease in milk products. Is that thinking correct? Probably not. Milk does not affect mucous production or quality. In one study of 60 volunteers, This has been confirmed in other studies as well. In a subset of asthmatic patients, cessation of milk consumption improved symptomatology, but this is thought to be due to an allergy to a component of milk. The advice to eat yogurt is in all likelihood an attempt to reduce the risk of C. diff (aka Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea), which is present with any antibiotic. Antibiotics upset gut flora.

Once the tetracycline (antibiotic) bonds, it creates a neutral environment for food to digest in. Once the calcium bonds with mil it breaks down the antibiotic as well as the stomach acid used to break it down.This will not only cause Mal-absorption of nutrients through your G.I. tract, but will also keep your body from breaking down the medication as efficiently or at all. Gastroparesis in combination with tetracycline is also sometimes reported, dairy products could exacerbate this, but this was out of an old medical journal, I don't know the validity of that so take it with a grain of salt..

From the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is this  , where they specifically discuss a few risks which I will summarize below.  All of this assumes a healthy pregnancy, and before term. The abstract summarizes it well: My summary of the specific risks from the longer paper: So - no, your partner did not put the fetus at particular risk by flying while pregnant; however, if she is likely to fly many times during the pregnancy (such as, if she works in sales and flies on a weekly basis), she should talk to her obstetrician and ask them whether the particular flight frequency and duration is safe throughout the pregnancy.	2017-09-21 17:57:18Z	Joe	10

Factors that are considered in recommendations include age, allergies (egg or mercury), and your medical history specifically if you are on a continuous steroid therapy or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  The medication that you received last year "AFLURIA" is not a Quadrivalent vaccine which means it only has the protection of 3 strains of the flu instead of 4. As mentioned in the comments, the strains selected is based on studies by health professionals to figure out the prevalence of a strain in a specific year. To get the extra protection ask for a quadrivalent vaccine and let the healthcare professional make the decision based on what he/she has available and your history. I have not found a study to compare the efficacy of the different quadrivalent vaccines and I do not think there will be one.  I would cite sources for what I said above, but this is all based on my experience as a healthcare professional. If you need additional information CDC website is your best source.

Vaping is around for somewhat 13 years ( ), but the international breakthrough was so recent that no long term studies have been conducted with meaningful results.  This is all there is to it.

13713	13724	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13724	The question might need isolation into two parts:  There should be little doubt that   habitually inhaling nitrosamines and aldehydes is probably better than doing so.  In the end, however, the suggestion is equivalent to "eating boiled steak is healthier than grilled steak" - for the very same plethora of chemicals that give flavor, but are the result of combustion - whether fine Turkish tobacco or Kobe beef.  I'll still take mine rare and blackened, please. Also, tempering the large research cited on   with the thought that "vaping" has created a whole large group of younger people that would not otherwise "smoke" burning tobacco,    Nor is research at all simple, as most "vapor" folks will not vape Frutopia Fun Blend #7 for decades, inhaling god-knows-what flavoring chemicals, with repeated long-term exposure and dosing. It can only be concluded that the combustion products are eliminated (or reduced by magnitudes).  If   are considered Enemy #1, then one could make the leap to "healthier".  But only with that assumption in place, and forsaking all others. "Substitution" presumes a nicotine addiction already in place.  The health effects of nicotine addiction   (without combustion and environmental factors) have not been proven or even justified well in my mind.  In fact, tests in rats have shown that nicotine alone may not be addictive at all.  Which right or wrong proves  . I worked for many years with a renown DABT toxicologist, building devices to smoke cigarettes in a precise way, and deliver "precision" cigarette smoke to lab animals like rodents and lagomorphs.  Not just for "cancer" type research, but psychology and performance physiology studies as well.  In fact, the nicotine and tar content have to be measured constantly and accurately by tobacco companies, for the required labeling, since tobacco is a natural product and can vary from season to season.  So I would say that I know a little something about this topic.  Very very little. A mere living will eventually lead to death.  Of this, and only this, I am certain.  Cites added to demonstrate some of the claims I made, and to comply with this stack's guidelines.  Note that I am not trying to   anything; I merely demonstrated a "path" to a conculsion of "healthier" (vaping vs. smoking) - with the provisio assumption that   products represent the bulk of the health risk compared to mere nicotene in water vapor.  It is only with this grand assumption one could come to a "healthier" conclusion.  The last cite is an interesting one that suggests the most meaningful "answer" to the OP question, within the framework of my assertions.	2017-09-21 03:55:33Z	SteveRacer	7

Most of the information on the internet is mere statements on sites that present health relevant info as easy and simple. But in reality most often answers to your question are not so easy and not so simple.  While certain companies and sometimes even mother nature might not subscribe to the following principle, at least you should treat yourself like a good doctor promised to do: first, do no harm! That means when looking for information you should always keep a very keen eye on on the cost/benefit relation that the information you find will hopefully enable you to estimate. Look for the possible side effects.

But they can actually vary quite widely within hours - depending on health conditions and medications.  It can even vary fatally in some (rare) cases. Why I cannot give a more complete answer: There are too many possible reasons to discuss adequately in an answer.  Therefore it would have to be individualized, which we can't do here.

13693	13710	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13710	It depends on the diet and the person. However, protein myths abound because people look at extreme ends of the scale, and assume that outlier needs are suitable for the masses. If you are looking for homeostasis and general maintenance, then the upper limit that has been shown in studies to be beneficial is 1.6g/kg/d, or about .73g/lb/day. 1g/lb/day is a little bit of overkill, but is an easy mark to remember. Where the outlier comes in is people using steroids for bodybuilding, which allows greater protein use than in a naturally training person. If you are looking for weight/fat loss with lean mass maintenance (i.e. losing as little muscle as possible while cutting calories), then a higher rate of protein intake is recommended to help make up for caloric deficits in carbohydrates. It is also noted that the higher the level of athlete, the   you need the protein (i.e. elite level athletes need less protein than beginners, as counterintuitive as that sounds). From a  : That article is an excellent read, and contains many links and references to studies on various protein intakes for low to elite level athletes and body builders. From  : Examining the article you link in the question, the end includes: (Emphasis mine) It then links to an article on "how much protein you should be eating", which notes: (Emphasis mine) So while all the articles agree that a general intake of around 1g/lb/day is the upper limit of beneficial, they also agree that in specific diets and goals, increasing the amount of protein can aid in weight loss and lean mass retention. I believe that is the intent of your original article, despite the somewhat click bait title.	2017-09-20 15:10:17Z	JohnP	3
13693	13708	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13708	Short answer yes, unless you have got any condition stopping you from doing so. 
Now the long answer:
Protein is the building block of the body. If we consider the human body as a huge network of interconnected chemical reactions, we can appreciate it a little better. Mostof chemical reactions in the body use enzymes as catalyst and most enzymes are proteins. A quick google search will provide you info on that matter.
Coming to topic at hand the protein RDA for a normal sedentary individual is  :
    
This value pales in comparison to the protein intake of athletes and especially body builders. As you increase your physical activity your body's demand for protein increases,as you're breaking down muscle to build more:     This is the reason for the association of high intake of protein with physically active individuals.  
For someone doing moderate amounts of resistance training 1.6-2g/kg should be fine.    High intensity strength training individuals have been reported to take around 3g/kg.

When significant, this is called orthostatic hypotension. The most common cause in a 'normal' person is because the veins in your legs hold more blood proportionally lying down than when standing and walking. When you suddenly stand, the blood returning to your heart in insufficient to supply your brain   (i.e. your   decreases.) The answer is, indeed, getting up slowly.  In addition, keeping well hydrated may help; Since in a supine position the venous capacitance is high, move the muscles in your legs - all of them from your toes up - to increase blood return to the heart. Start by pointing toes (entire foot) down then up a few times, rotate your ankles, stretch your legs, bend your knees, squeeze your knees together, push them apart against resistance, etc. If you're on your back, roll over once or twice and back again. Then see if all that helped. If this only happens in the morning, keep water by your bed and drink a couple of glasses of water (about 16 oz) before getting up (ideally up to 30 minutes before), and elevate the head of your bed. Get enough exercise. There are a lot of medical causes of dizziness on standing as well. Because of your age and how long this has been going on, one would need to do a few tests to see if your nervous system is slow to respond to sudden changes in cardiac output (this is called autonomic dysfunction). If this is bothersome enough, a more in-depth evaluation should be done. Only a good exam by a doctor can tell if it is significant enough to warrant further investigation. If you're unhappy with your doctor's approach, get a second opinion. Above all, take @DoctorWhom's advice in her comment.	2017-09-20 15:20:38Z	DoctorWhom	1

13683	13716	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13716	In the picture you provided, the tonsils are enlarged and they appear to be   (that is, they have little "caves" where food and bacteria can get trapped and grow.) Cryptic tonsils are common, painless, a common cause of bad breath, and a source of   or tonsil stones. Below is a picture of a tonsils with tonsilliths.  are whitish material that appear on tonsils which are inflammed. The cause can be viral or bacterial. Sometimes the exudates are so typical of one or the other that a fairly accurate diagnosis can be made just by looking at the throat. For example,   is characterized by enlarged tonsils (sometimes so enlarged that they meet in the middle, called "kissing tonsils") and a membraneous-looking exudate, as in the picture below. Tonsillar ulcers usually occur with viral infections. They look like craters, usually surrounded with redness. Strep is the most common bacterial infection of the throat. Strep throat  can look like anything or even nothing, so I won't include a picture, because the appearance of the throat is usually useless for its diagnosis. Exudates of some kind are common but not necessary. Strep throat is treated with an antibiotic, as is diptheria and gonococcus. Diptheria is a very serious infection where the tonsild are covered by a membrane somewhat similar to Infectious Mononucleosis, but usually worse. A vaccination program can largely eliminate diptheria except in cases where immunity has worn off or has never "taken". Candidiasis is a yeast infection common in children, when it is called "thrush". It is treated with antifungals. The exudates are more diffuse, appearing on the uvula, the palate, and sometimes the tongue as well. There are many viruses that can cause exudates, and antibiotics don't help when a virus is the cause. The most common causes of sore throat with exudates is a virus, not all of which are listed. It is important to know the cause of an exudate for two reasons: contagiousness (how likely someone you come into contact with can become infected) and other organ systems which may become involved. Both strep and Infectious Mononucleosis can be diagnosed on an office visit (perhaps two if the first test is equivocal.) Strep is painful; Infectious Mononucleosis can be painful or not, is common in young adults, and is easily spread. When you see a throat like that pictured in the question, the safest and smartest thing to do is to be seen by your doctor, so that you get treated if needed, and so that you don't unknowingly spread an infection. The doctor can advise you on the precautions necessary and what to look for that means the infection is getting worse.	2017-09-20 17:02:07Z	anongoodnurse	5

The smoke component is a carcinogen (can cause cancer) that can cause lung cancer, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen. However, nicotine is an addictive substance that makes a person want a cigarette again and again. Finally the smoke effects that accumulate and can damage the lungs. What about vape that can not be from tobacco? Is nicotine really safe for the lungs? The researchers tried to test nicotine against the lung tissue, either from cigarettes or from electric cigarettes. Nicotine can cause inflammation of the lungs, also reduces the ability of tissue to protect from foreign substances. According to Irina Petrache, physician and lung specialist at Indiana University, Indianapolis, her research team discovered nicotine from wherever it was originally harmful to the lung tissue. Petrache and eliminate no more than smoking, if appropriate lung health. Even vape users are more at risk of exposure to nicotine. Why? Electric cigarette devices, especially the tubes with higher voltages can flow large amounts of nicotine into the body. Therefore, electric cigarette users remain automatic against addiction. As we know whether nicotine addiction can make it hard to let go, the body will show certain physical symptoms when you try to loose, such as dizziness and nausea. Researchers taking place on Toxicology and Applied Pharmacy, are trying to collect evidence of electric cigarettes against the lungs. A study of 25 people was found to have the same effect on the short-term effects of tobacco smoking as well as vaping. The game showed the same symptoms of inflammation and lung damage.	2017-09-18 09:33:15Z	Aldan	-1

Examples of intrinsic are Hypoplasia (poor formation of the tooth structure) or flourosis (too much flouride uptake into the tooth struture during formation). Extrinsic could be due to uneven bleaching/whitening of the teeth. If the intrinsic defects are superficial, simple tooth-coloured fillings can correct the situation. More severe problems need crowning (a cap over the tooth).

Most procedures that CAN be tolerated awake ARE done awake. General anesthesia has more risks than just anesthetic locally and an anxiolytic to relax the patient.  It often requires airway protection (e.g. MAC or intubation) which also carries risks, and generally requires anesthesiology present in the room.  Sometimes if there is concern that the patient cannot handle it and would move excessively due to anxiety or such, then they may do moderate/general anesthesia on a case by case basis. This is not something I could specifically find, but I can theorize that if there were to be disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque resulting in stroke, rare but a potential risk of the procedure, then the physician could identify signs of stroke far better when the patient is awake then when asleep.  Interventions to treat stroke are time-sensitive ("time is brain" is the saying) so a delay could have serious results. Source: 	2017-09-17 08:46:01Z	DoctorWhom	4
13656	13670	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13670	Fractures would be a good reason to be fully immobilized in a cast (after the first 5-10 days in a splint to allow swelling to go down) but they usually take   enough to remove a cast/brace (one sources says maybe 3 for a minor fracture in a finger).   For your character to have around 2 weeks of immobilization, a few ideas: Suggestion 1:    There are recommendations to start physical therapy early on, so it would be removed for short periods of time to do gradually increasing exercises to strengthen and rehab. Rest, Ice, and Elevation are the other treatments involved.  You can sprain things by over-extending past its usual range of motion. To sprain the back of the wrist/hand your character could fall onto the hand when it's flexed (the opposite direction of the photo in that link).  I've seen it happen from a motorcycle fall.  At 2 weeks they may not be at full function, however, they may still need to continue physical therapy for a while and be careful. Suggestion 2:    He/she could have burned themselves on fire, the stove, hot metal or chemicals.  If the burn is extensive, especially on the fingers or back of the hand (where there is higher tension on the skin), the doc may apply a semi-immobilizing brace to hold the hand in a neutral position, to prevent the person from flexing the digit/hand and breaking apart the healing skin.  Burns are treated with specific creams and bandaging to protect from infection, so the brace is usually removed once or twice a day to change bandages. Burns can, though not always, leave pretty impressive scars. Suggestion 3:    Not all lacerations are treated with sutures, but if they are deep OR on the back side of the hand (where there is higher tension on the skin) it is more common.  It the injuries are extensive, especially if it's across a joint line (like the wrist or knuckles), then after suturing and bandaging they may apply a similar brace. Note that unlike burns, you usually don't keep a bandage on after a day or two.  If they had to leave a brace on, they may just use a non-stick bandage between the sutures and the brace and make sure it's not too tight. It's pretty easy to find an embarrassing way to have this happen, it all depends on the situation and the character.  There are a thousand ways to fall, cut yourself, burn yourself, or otherwise hurt a hand.  I've certainly done it.  We tend to stick them out to protect ourselves whenever we're falling, to shield ourselves from oncoming harm, or to stop other people/things.  	2017-09-17 05:23:02Z	DoctorWhom	3

The standard treatment of bone fracture is immobilisation of the bone. Either an orthopaedic cast or splint might be necessary, and maybe even a nail if the wrist is messed up really badly. This renders both arm and hand pretty useless, the affected appendage would be basically unusable during the recovery period. The cast will have to be in place until the bone fully healed, which would have taken 2 weeks, if I had listened to the doctors.  If you need a longer time of immobilisation, consider the following: My 11 year old self really wanted to go to my best friend's birthday party. That took place at a swimming pool. Obviously, at some point I had to fall into the water, and it was quite embarrassing telling the doctors that I did not follow their instructions (which was a pretty explicit "Do NOT let water touch your cast), and the cast had to be redone because it partly dissolved.

( ) As   pointed out in the comments, atherosclerosis  and ascending aortic dissection  can lead to difference in the blood pressure. Furthermore, as a study fairly recently conducted (2012) found, not measuring bilaterally can have other devastating effects as well: An undetected difference in blood pressure greater than 15 mmHg increases the overall mortality by 60%, and cardiovascular mortality even by 70%. Furthermore, the risk of suffering from an undiagnosed PAD (peripheral artery disease)  increases by factor 2.5.  The study concludes that Furthermore, the chances of a wrong reading are significantly lower if verified once. : Atherosclerosis is a form of arteriosclerosis where the artery wall thickens, thus leading to an increased blood pressure in this artery (and depending on the location, can lead to a difference between L and R blood pressure). : The aortic dissection is a tear in the wall of the aorta. As the tear extends along the wall of the aorta, blood can flow in between the layers of the blood vessel wall (dissection).

If your practitioner would have put the probe into her own mouth before examining yours, then that would be a great way to spread whatever. Your own mouth is an ecosystem where one, local, inflamed, infection can easily spread to any other place within your mouth, no probes needed.

Wounds left to heal on their own - without stitches - heal by  , that is, the wound fills in with a temporary tissue called granulation tissue. The best outcome is that enough granulation tissue is laid down to cover the wound, then, within the tissue, the normal components of skin, such as epithelial tissue and blood vessels grow. However, this is somewhat of a "dance" dependent on how much of what kinds of signals the injured tissue sends out, and sometimes the granulation tissue grows too much, and actually impedes the process of epithelialization. In that case, the excess granulation tissue (or even all of it) needs to be removed so the process can start over (the process is dependent on the right amount of the right signals (e.g. growth factors).  This is what was meant by the doctor. As to why silver nitrate was used, it destroys granulation tissue, but so does just picking it off and other methods. Your wound specialist really should have this talk down pat enough to give the answer in under a minute. But patients ask questions, and time is getting shorter and shorted for doctors to spend with patients (blame insurance companies for that.) So one way to save time is to avoid answering questions.

(See the Risk Factors section of this  , which focuses on medical causes of constipation.) There's nothing complicated about mystery little factors in your food that combine to create a problem. If you eat only white rice and meat for a meal, with no vegetables, then you are eating a lot less fibre than someone who added vegetables to that meal or who ate beans instead of meat. First thing to do if you're suffering constipation is to drink a lot more water. Second thing to do is add vegetables and legumes to your meals. There are things you can do beyond that, but they are not dietary and should probably be suggested by someone more familiar with your personal situation. More water and more fibre are generally a safe approach, so if you're sure your situation is caused by what you eat and drink, fix that.

  -  Unilateral - when the pelvis and femur are fixed the iliopsoas will
produce ipsilateral FB of the lumbar spine with contralateral RO.
The FB of the spine relative to the pelvis will decrease lumbar lordosis
Bilateral contraction of iliopsoas produces ant pelvic rotation and takes the sacrum along  
 - when pelvis is fixed,  flexes the thigh on the pelvis
 - thigh and lumbar spine are fixed – and pelvis is free to move – it can cause ant innominate torsion ipsilaterally  
 - Directly influence SI jt thru the pubic symphysis - since the gluteus medius tends to pull the ilium away from the sacrum- almost a distraction effect
 - Create stress through public symphyisis 
 - Adductors- create stress thru pubic symphysis
 - Abductors sartorius may have an anterior torsion effect on the innominate when the hip is extended and the knee is slightly flexed abductor   
-Bilateral contraction of the piriformis produces a nutation effect on the sacrum 
– Unilaterally get a rotational effect toward contralateral side  Bilateral contraction of the maximus- post pelvic rotation – unilateral contraction – causes ipsilateral post torsion   Tightness can cause post innominate torsion   Contributes to the stiffness of the SI jt  - bilaterally contraction-stabilizes the lumbar spine and can result in sacral nutation  – it is considered an anticipatory stabilizer of the LS spine 
the multifidi are recruited as a stabilizer before the Lower and Upper limbs  move 
Co contraction of multifidus and the TrA – further increase stiffness of the SI jt.  Ipsilateral side bending will increase the shearing stress to the ipsilateral SI jt  As treatments are very evaluation dependent I’d really need results of an evaluation and orthopedic testing otherwise I’d just be throwing out random exercises.	2017-09-12 09:33:33Z	Mike-DHSc	2

13550	13554	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13554	VOCs are one of the most prevalent indoor air pollutants. They are released by many common materials, from foams to carpets to paints.  House air circulation is not very conducive to adequate dispersion, and it is usually worse in the winter.  There are known health effects from headaches to cancer.  Effects experienced are usually limited to symptoms rather than more severe pathology, but it depends on air concentration and chemical. There are filtration systems for VOCs.  This is not an exhaustive list.   I have written a term paper on plant VOC filtration, and researched/spoken with an MD pulmonologist who is an Environmental Health professor, for my OWN home air quality questions.  Sources below.

13545	13547	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13547	All treatments have side effects, some more debilitating than others. The trick with pharmacology is to balance the benefit of treatment with the hazards of the side effects. Take cancer chemotherapy. The drugs we use for cancer chemotherapy are   poisons. We literally use   to treat cancer. Why do we deliberately poison cancer patients with what amounts to a weapon of mass destruction? Because if we don't, the cancer will kill them.  In pharmacology there's a concept of a  . That is, there's a particular amount of compound that will cause death or other severe disability. There's another (hopefully lower) level of the compound that will effectively treat the disease. In treating, we hope to hit that middle ground: enough to treat the disease, but not enough to kill the patient. Different drugs have different therapeutic window. The window for over-the-counter drugs like asprin is rather large: the amount needed for severe side effects is many times higher than what people take to treat headaches. That's why we can allow untrained people to self-dose. (Though look at acetaminophen/paracetamol as an over-the-counter example where the window is not as large as it probably should be.)  In contrast, the threaputic window for many chemotherapy drugs is rather narrow. To make sure we hit that window, they're typically dosed by licensed professionals in a very controlled environment. Back to thalidomide. The side effects of thalidomide are pretty severe. But to some extent they're controllable. If you scrupulously avoid exposing pregnant women or women who may become pregnant to thalidomide, you can avoid the teratogenic consequences. For the other consequences, you're back to the theraputic window: you want to hit a level of drug that is effective in treating the disease, but minimizes side effects. That's why thalidomide has been approved. It's a cost/benefit analysis. The approving authorities took a look at the hazards of leaving leprosy and multiple myeloma untreated (or treated with other methods) versus the hazards from exposure to thalidomide. On the whole, they felt that the risks of thalidomide could be mitigated enough that it was the "lesser evil" than leaving the diseases untreated. That said, if someone came out with a wonder drug that was as effective as thalidomide in treating these diseases but had fewer (or more benign) side effects, doctors would drop thalidomide like a hot potato, and the FDA might even revoke its approval. (Similar arguments hold for other potentially hazardous drugs like the nitrogen mustard chemotherapeutics.)	2017-09-06 17:07:05Z	R.M.	37

Eventually, once the femur heals, you should be able to exercise on it unless there are some unusual individual circumstances. However, you do not want to start exercising if the bone has not healed yet. Whether the bone is healed or not will depend on (a) how long it has been since the surgery (a day? a year?), (b) how bad the break was, (c) the type of surgery performed to repair it, and (d) the general health of the patient. Pain is generally a warning sign that means "be careful" so if your leg is in pain, you should listen to that warning sign and avoid stressing the area. So, in summary: (1) Talk to the doctor who operated and ask how long you need to wait before you can exercise, and what types of exercise would be appropriate; (2) After your doctor clears you for exercise, consider talking to a physical therapist about the best way to strengthen the area. Exercise is great for improving many aspects of health, but you need to be careful if you have a broken bone. 	2017-09-06 00:23:41Z	veritessa	3

UVA is primarily responsible for photoaging, and UVB for the superficial burning that results from sun exposure (2). UVB electromagnetic radiation converts 7-dehydrocholestrol to pre-vitamin D3, which is then converted into Vitamin D3 (1). Sunscreens with an SPF rating absorb or reflect (depending on the filters used) UVB light (2). Without UVB light, 7-dehydrocholestrol cannot be converted into pre-vitamin D. It may also be of interest to note that glass blocks UVB (but not UVA radiation) and thus has a similar effect on Vitamin D production (1).  In reality, however, people rarely apply sunscreen well enough so that Vitamin D production completely ceases (3). In short, yes sunscreen does inhibit the production of Vitamin D, although in most cases not to such an extent that Vitamin D deficiency becomes a concern. 	2017-09-05 22:38:04Z		2

To answer the   part of your question: Martindale, Extrapharmacopoeia (34th edition) states that half-life following oral administration for tramadol is 6 hours - that is, in most people the concentration should reduce by half after six hours. Apart from this and the initial dose, we lack a lot of data. Therefore, we would have to simplify the possible calculations making very, very rough approximations that: In these circumstances, after n elimination half-times, there would be 0.5^n parts of medicine left in the body. That is, after 5 elimination times, i.e. 30 hours, there should be about 3.125% of the dose left. Given the roughness of our assumptions it would probably be a bit more (but we can't know how much). With this piece of information we should ask ourselves - is this remaining dose sufficient to cause drowsiness. For that, we would need tramadol's  , which I can't find. 
The theory gets more complex because there are two other active substances involved: codeine and paracetamol. Metabolism and subsequent elimination can be slowed down since metabolic pathways of these tree substances overlap. What's more, codeine can cause dose-dependent drowsiness itself (although in combination preparations doses are usually lower, we can't completely exclude possible synergistic effects with tramadol). In the end, every person can have slightly different physiology.  My point is: even though there are many ways to calculate the kinetics of a medication in a body, there is a lot of (experimental) data that we would need and a lot of factors influence the processes affecting the medicines' movement through the body and its effects.   (and in very severe cases some lab tests) - your mother's doctor (or, if necessary, as @DoctorWhom suggested poison control centre) will know if they should do something and what. For example, your mother's doctor may decide to switch the medication combination or alter the dose. 
There is really no way to tell based solely on theoretical assumptions. The data you can find on the internet is also very rough and most likely assumes that tramadol was the only medication taken (which wasn't the case here).

It might rouse them from their stupor because of the physical activity it involves, but it does nothing specific to increase their level of consciousness. If vomiting accomplishes this temporary feat, vigorous efforts to rouse them would probably accomplish the same. Trust me, people can and do choke to death on their own vomit while unconscious due to alcohol. By no means is vomiting guaranteed to wake them. What vomiting does do is remove alcohol still in the stomach, which means it reduces the intoxication level that is yet to come. If someone is drunk enough to be unconscious and has a stomach full of alcohol that hasn't been absorbed yet, vomiting might very well save their life. What most people who drink to the level of stupor don't understand is just how close to death they are at that stage. Respiratory depression and death are the next stages.

A primary theory is that antipsychotics that have dopaminergic receptor antagonism Of those medications, haloperidol, risperidone, and amisulpride are also known to raise levels of prolactin, which inhibits testosterone production.  This has a higher association with sexual dysfunction. Olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole are less likely to do so. Bupropion inhibits reuptake (increases amount) of norepinephrine and dopamine. It is one of the antidepressants least likely to be associated with sexual dysfunction. You should talk with your psychiatrist that prescribes you this combination of medications and seek his/her advice.  These are common side effects. You should also talk with your primary care physician.  They can do the endocrinology tests for prolactin and/or testosterone IF they feel they are appropriate.  They will likely ask that you discuss your meds with your psychiatrist as well, as they are the experts. Another possibility is to talk with a urologist, who are the experts in male genitalia and everything about them.  But a primary care doctor is generally better at putting the whole-person picture together, if you have additional medical issues that are not being addressed.  A sexologist is not a medical doctor (at least in my understanding it is a branch of psychology) and as such is not going to be able to do those tests or prescribe anything like testosterone - if that is necessary.  They are, however, extremely helpful in addressing all other contributing factors to low libido and erectile dysfunction! This is not medical advice; talk everything over with your physician before making changes, and for anything regarding your unique situation. But overall, managing schizophrenia is paramount to anything else, as uncontrolled symptoms affect ALL quality of life aspects not just sex. I sincerely applaud anyone who maintains their schizophrenia well managed on medications, as it is easy to think "I feel fine maybe I don't need it" and fall into relapse of symptoms.  It can be a very difficult condition to treat because med adherence is so important.  Libido can be adjusted with things like sexual therapy and possibly medications, but when a condition like schizophrenia is well managed, you don't want to mess with changing those meds unless it's under your psychiatrist's careful guidance!	2017-08-30 08:19:09Z	DoctorWhom	3

However, in individuals with myopia, the eyeball is too long and focuses light in front of the retina.  Although genetics plays a major role in the development of myopia, it's development may also be affected by how an individual uses their eyes.

Some health and safety interest groups have interpreted certain reports to suggest that wireless device use may be linked to cancer and other illnesses, posing potentially greater risks for children than adults.  Although no scientific evidence currently establishes a direct link between wireless device use and cancer (or other illnesses), some consumers are skeptical of the science and analysis that underlies the FCC’s RF exposure guidelines. Thus, some parties recommend taking precautionary measures to further reduce exposure to RF energy.  The FCC does not endorse the need for these practices, but provides information on steps you can take to reduce your exposure to RF energy from cell phones. For example, Some of the FCC's suggested measures to reduce RF exposure include the following: Although potentially misleading, some parties recommend considering reported SAR values of wireless devices.

13435	13437	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13437	Screening tests such as "blood tests and imaging" have two costs and one benefit: Obviously, deciding whether or not to screen will be different for every disease because each of these costs and benefits will be different for every disease. But it's really important to realize that screening brings false positives. These cause distress and anguish to people who believe they are dying and they cost a lot of money because the investigations required are expensive and intrusive. Recently Ontario has stopped recommending women do monthly breast self exams. These are free. However they do not save any lives. Women who actually have lumps find them without dutifully checking every month or week for them. But with the regular screening, many find things that are not cancers. They need to take time off work, get biopsies, which can be inconclusive, get scans, even have surgery to remove lumps so they can be sent to pathology, and so on. This costs a lot of money directly to the hospital and indirectly in people being off work. All this expense is pointless: there is no difference in survival rates between groups who do BSE and those who do not. They didn't even take into account the misery of thinking you have cancer when you don't. (A   about the changes, which also includes not having doctors do breast exams routinely if there are no symptoms, and not having mammograms before age 50. The   referred to in that article.)  For screenings that are not just self-examination, consider also the radiation from scans, the chances of an allergic reaction to contrast dye, the chances of infection from a blood test, of catching an antibiotic-resistant infection while in the hospital recovering from having something removed, and so on. Both the screening and the procedures that happen when someone screens positive can hurt or kill people if you screen everyone, meaning millions of people. Finally, while it may seem logical to you that screenings like this would save lives by catching things earlier, there is very little evidence to support that. Our bodies actually destroy small cancers all the time: just because you see a small cancer on a scan doesn't mean the huge treatment machine has to swing into action. That is only needed when a small cancer demonstrates it's becoming a big cancer. And in the majority of cases, there are symptoms. These things get found.	2017-08-25 13:40:07Z	Kate Gregory	6

This is to add on to it: Making a decision on whether to recommend screening tests for the entire population is different from deciding whether to screen an individual patient. The    At the population level, things like cost-benefit analysis, how rare a condition is, how many you need to screen before you prevent 1 cancer, and risk (like what % of screening tests result in harmful outcomes) are extremely important.  This is reflected in the Grades. Grade   recommendations =  onsider offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual circumstances. Grade   recommendations =  iscourage the use of this service. At the individual level, like grade C, individual considerations must be taken into consideration. That is why it takes a clinician to discern whether or not to do a non-recommended screening test (or not do a recommended screening test). Also,    Once someone is extremely anemic, the appropriate workup for anemia isn't screening, it's diagnostic.  The recommended workup steps for symptoms/signs/findings are established by consensus of experts based on research.  That's another topic.	2017-08-26 06:55:12Z	DoctorWhom	6
13429	13432	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13432	This is very broad as asked. I will answer with one example, there are others. Immunotherapy gets the patient's own immune system to destroy the tumours rather than the treatment itself destroying them. This might involve making the immune system more active, or interfering with the way that tumours hide or shield themselves from the immune system. For example, Wikipedia says of  (Lymphocytes are your own white blood cells, the same mechanism that cleans up infections in your body all the time.) This   at cancer.gov summarizes some studies showing how Ipilimumab and other immunotherapies are changing outcomes for melanoma. You can do you own searches for other drugs and other cancers. For example Nivolumab is combined with "ipi" for melanoma. I have also seen ads on tv for Nivolumab for lung cancer. How much longer will patients live? That depends on the cancer. Melanoma has dismal outcomes if it's Stage IV - median survival of about 6 months, less than 10% surviving 5 years - and chemotherapy doesn't help survival. (One   on how bad stage IV is with traditional treatments.)  So there's plenty of room for improvement. The studies in the article above include some of that improvement. It's hard to find much on long-term odds, because they haven't been using these drugs long - ten years at most.  Why not use it everywhere? Well they literally do not know what cancers it works for (presumably not all of them) or precisely what kind of survival improvements to expect. It's a no-brainer to use it with something that has survival times of just a few months, but should you use it with something that has survival times of 2 or 3 years? Because there is a cost. First, a dollar-cost: $200,000 a year is typical. And second, the side effects are very bad. They can be fatal. And when they're not fatal, they're hospitalize-you-and-major-steroids bad, and take-a-compensating-medication-for-the-rest-of-your-life bad. The immune system can over-react causing inflammation and swelling that might damage or destroy your thyroid, pancreas, adrenal gland, or whatnot, or give you colitis. Understanding the side effects is a big part of the current studies. One   describing how people went from months of survival to years mentions "55% of patients will have high-grade adverse events" so widespread use will be held back by that. Here's a   I'm very familiar with. It compares two dose regimens of two different immunotherapy drugs for melanoma. These regimens have already been shown to have the same response rate; the study compares the side effects. It's normal for some patients to have to stop taking the treatment because the side effects are intolerable. And a similar   (same combination of drugs, same disease) reported results where over 60% of patients getting the combination were still alive after 2 years. 65% is so much better than 10%! There are other immunotherapy drugs, but in general you see: From a personal point of view, yesterday I said to my doctor "it feels like being around when insulin or antibiotics were first being used" and he agreed, yes it does. But that includes the part where you don't know for sure how things will turn out.	2017-08-25 02:58:50Z	Kate Gregory	2

There is a hint at benefit throughout a number of studies, but that has to be tempered by the various sources of imbalance and bias in this literature. My guess is that there must be some subgroup of patients who are benefiting to balance out harms in others. Unfortunately, our currently approach is akin to giving thrombolytics to all chest pain patients, or at least to any patient with a positive troponin. In that population, lytics fail. We don’t have an ST elevation equivalent to guide us in stroke.  I don’t know. If NINDS was replicated today, I would open the odds between 4:1 and 9:1 against the same results. (In other words, I think there is about a 10-20% chance that if the same protocol was run, we would see the same results). I think we clearly need more research. I think basic philosophy of science and statistical tenants tell us that we must attempt to replicate NINDS. Or maybe this whole debate will simply disappear, as endovascular therapy becomes the new norm. More on that next time… “There is a treatment we sometimes use for stroke that is supposed to break down the clot causing the stroke. The treatment is controversial, and you will probably hear different things from different doctors. The issue is that out of 13 major trials, only 2 have shown benefit, and both of those trials have some problems, and they were both paid for by the people who make the drug.  There are some risks that we’re certain about: about 1 in 12 patients will have severe bleeding resulting in worse neurologic outcome. Despite that risk, in the best case scenario, about 1 in 10 people given this drug early will have a noticeable improvement in their function after 3 months.  Unfortunately, it isn’t clear how reliable the science has been, and we don’t know which patients have the greatest chance at benefit or harm. The choice to receive this medication remains up to each individual patient.” Source: https://first10em.com/2017/05/26/thrombolytics-for-stoke/ 	2017-08-29 04:28:32Z	Mike-DHSc	1
13423	13424	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13424	You should see a GI doctor. There are two ways to treat gastric ulcers. With antacids (like calcium carbonate "Tums") that bind with the acid and neutralize it, and medications that block acid production like PPIs and H2 blockers. Neither cause excessive acid secretion. The notion that an antacid causes excessive secretion is not recorded anywhere.  PPI and H2 blockers can cause excessive acid after you abruptly stop taking them.  It's called rebound acid production or secretion. It's not permanent, however taking antacids after stopping acid reducers is recommended for a few weeks to allow your stomach to readjust to normal state. In short, there is a very small possibility that rebound acid could cause an ulcer after you stop taking your acid reducer. That's just my logic on the matter. If treated properly, you should remain ulcer free. If not a specialist needs to find out why it's chronic if it is.	2017-08-23 19:55:43Z	DoctorWhom	3

Most commonly it's early joint degradation and odd sensations in the legs due to tension that isn't evenly dispersed. This is somewhat of a controversial topic though, there's limited research on somewhat benign misalignment. Usually more severe cases are studied. You'd need measurements and scans done to determine if it's actually misaligned.	2017-08-23 15:24:08Z	cloudnyn3	2

In my experience as a clinician, the answer is yes. However, in my view spinal misalignment is a laypersons description of what I would call a somatic dysfunction, from the osteopathic field, or a neuromuscular dysfunction, from the physical therapy view point. I have personally experienced and have witnessed in my patients improved wellbeing and decreased pain levels after resolving these dysfunctions. Additional benefits include improved efficiency with balance and force production by athletes.
My frustration with the misalignment language is clinicians desire to 'realign' the spine through manipulation. Manipulation can be useful with extremely hypomobile joints. However, since bones do not move themselves and muscles are merely the actuators, the real problem is primarily one of the peripheral nervous system. Manipulation and stretching do help reset the PNS but only for a short time. Techniques such as functional/indirect, muscle energy, and strain counterstrain are much more effective as they deal with directly effecting the underlying tone characteristics of an entire joint. Integrating this joint into a functional chain then becomes possible using neuromuscular reeducation. All of these techniques are only as effective as the practitioner applying them. Hope this helps.	2017-08-26 12:45:26Z	user11216	1

Influence of undernutrition on wound healing
Even in uncomplicated starvation, as during a prolonged fasting, the body of an average adult subject loses 60 to 70 g of protein (240–280 g of muscle tissue) per day. However, severe trauma or sepsis can increase the loss of body protein up to 150 to 250 g (600–1000 g of muscle tissue) per day. Wound healing is delayed in subjects who had periods of starvation (simple or stress starvation) before injury or a surgical procedure due to the lack of endogenous substrates. Further undernutrition impedes wound healing in addition to: And of course there is an increased need for fatty acids, vitamin C, iron, zinc etc. From a surgeon's perspective these points need to be considered: For a more comprehensive view of nutrition and wound healing, take a look at	2017-11-19 18:57:03Z	LangLangC	1
13418	13447	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13447	The reason for fasting is important to identify. If you are fasting to become better at mobilizing fat as an energy source then you have to fast for at least 48 hours. Protein can inhibit this as your body can then break the protein apart and use it as a source of glucose. Additionally, protein encourages growth hormone production. If you are physically active the growth hormone is shuttled into your muscle fibers. However if you are not, excessive protein consumption can drive cancerous processes in the body. The real benefit in fasting seems to be the apoptosis (self programmed death) of dysfunctional cells such as cancerous or precancerous cell lines. As these dysfunctional cells are deleted, healthy cells are preserved. When one then begins the refeeding period, you regain your former weight by using the left over healthy cells to generate the newly needed cells. The research by Valter Longo into Fast Mimicing Diets talks about this process. When using this protocol, protein is excluded from the fasting period to avoid encouraging cancer growth. However, protein use during refeeding should be fine when paired with exercise.	2017-08-26 13:02:22Z	user11216	-1

For medical diagnosis,   that as well as your medical and sexual history, your doctor will check your penis and testicles to make sure they look normal and their nerves work as expected. He may also look for hair loss and larger-than-normal breasts. Both of these can be signs that you have a hormone problem. He may also check your pulse at your wrists and ankles to see whether your blood flow is normal,listen to your heartbeat to make sure it sounds right, and take your blood pressure. Based on your physical exam, as well as looking at your medical and sexual history, your doctor may want to order certain blood or urine tests, or even an overnight erection test. If it looks more likely that a mental or emotional issue is the source of the problem, your doctor will ask you standard questions about your mental well-being.

That is quite ironic because a vegetarian or vegan diet that is not well planned tends to increase this unhealthy ratio of fatty acids.

She says now she wishes she had gone ages ago.  The Dr helps her with adjustments and then gives her exercises to do at home as well.  She too (my mother) has no ear sensations that she is aware of, but that makes no difference really.  After seeing the tremendous difference it was in her life to see the ENT, it would be the first place I would go if I were having those symptoms.  If it's not ear related, they can also determine   as well and suggest what she needs to look into next.   No one should just live with vertigo attacks and it can be very dangerous (think of one coming on while driving, on stairs, etc).  Even one attack a month can cripple your life if you can't even say when it's coming.  My mother was stubborn and it took her becoming desperate to seek proper help.  She was in bed often at that time and loosing weight due to nausea (she kept telling me she was "taking a nap").

Peristalsis is under the control of several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. One of these is acetylcholine. One of the two major classes of acetylcholine receptors are known as the   (nAChR). These receptors are so-named because nicotine, found in cigarettes, is a strong agonist for them (although their typical endogenous agonist is acetylcholine). There is good evidence that nAChRs are involved in gut peristalsis. Antagonists of nAChRs reduce peristalsis   and agonists increase peristalsis  . Therefore, you can expect that cigarettes, which contain nicotine, would increase gut motility and therefore make bowel movements more likely or more imminent. Of course, there can also be daily cycles of bowel function, so you cannot easily link smoking in the morning to a specific subsequent bowel movement. References Blank, E.

If a bio-medical researcher spent every day working, the whole day, working on your case, they could probably figure it out. The way to solve this problem is to collect as much data as you can.

There's no real trick other than to change your diet and put a time investment into exercise. Something I've noticed is that it is difficult to maintain a diet while working in an office. It's difficult to focus mentally when you're hungry. I noticed that working manual jobs (I emptied shipping containers for a while) it was easier to eat less since you didn't need to be mentally focused.  That pretty much leaves exercise as your best bet. Is it possible for you to start cycling to work? This is a real 'two birds, one stone' solution. Working full time, you lack the free time to fully dedicate to exercise. Your commute is time wasted as it is, so why not cycle some or all of the way to your office? 
 It's great for cardio, great for weight loss (the calories you burn are huge), and makes your legs look damn sexy. Otherwise, swimming is another good option because it exercises your whole body and isn't a huge time sink. You don't need to do a lot to gain huge results. You can swim and hour in the morning/on your lunch/after work and gain a huge amount from it.  Ultimately the key is to cut your diet down and exercise and you should see results in no time. Just doing one or the other may disappoint you, in my own experience, over how slow progress you may make, and cause you to give up, but if you do both for a month or so you'll notice the difference.

You can get a more precise estimate by adding three factors, the Basal Metabolic Rate (BRM),   and food processing calorie consumption. So, for example, if you weigh 200 pound, are 5'10", male and 40 years old, then your estimated BMR is 66 + (6 * 200) + (12.9 * 70) - (6.8 * 40 ) = 1957 calories. If we add in 300 calories for walking around and 200 calories for processing food (10% of the food consumed), then the total is around 2500 calories. A weight loss diet could be, for example, half of that, which 1250 calories per day. A person with this nutrition profile will steadily lose fat if they eat below 2500 calories per day. The rate of weight loss depends on how big the caloric deficit is. So, in the above example, a person with a 2500 requirement and a 1250 diet will lose about 1250 calories per day. A pound of body fat will generate about 3500 calories of energy. That means with a 1250 deficit, the person will lose 1/3 pound per day, or 10 pounds every month.	2017-08-16 15:19:10Z	Tyler Durden	-1

But they're still stimulants so they can give an ability to controlling attention for longer period. You should be able to spend a lot of time on something but maybe not so unwillingly. First it's important to understand this "hyper focus". It's stronger "flow mode" in neurotypical (healthy) people. It's can be used as an advantage but it makes you unable to see danger in your environment - diffused attention is important to see other distractions and decide what to do with them (act or ignore them). Hyper focus can be explained as being unable to change the thing you're focused at. ADHD isn't about lack of attention - it's a problem with controlling attention and filtering distractions from the environment.	2017-11-22 09:52:47Z	Jadwiga_94_LDZ	-1

This is hardly the case though. The lower risk of developing cancer is because passive smokers don't inhale the same amount of smoke - you usually walk past a smoker and not stand right next to them until they have finished their cigarette. However, the total amount of toxic fumes passive smokers inhale is less than what smokers inhale, because the former are not exposed to smoke as often as the latter. Again, the risk is lower than the risk of smokers because it is   an exposure during work or at home and are not expected to inhale the same amount of smoke as bystanders as smokers do. Second hand smoking is especially damaging to children: Early exposure to chemicals is a lot more damaging than during adulthood. This can lead to early heard attacks and other coronary diseases.

If you are willing to meet with a nutritionist, that is a great start, then adding in cardio workouts and perhaps something for stress reduction, which can be anything from yoga to painting to walks in nature, whatever works for you, even meditation is great for many.  You should not start doing these things without monitoring your blood pressure ever though.  If you are seeking to make any major lifestyle changes while medicated, your doctor needs to be involved.  If you stay on the medication and manage to decrease your blood pressure, then you will be over-medicated.

There are varying degrees you can experience such things and   it might be a good idea to consider medication   making lifestyle changes to assist you.  As a mother to young kids myself, I know that I am prone to anxiety.  What I didn't know initially was that I am also prone to developing something called post partum hyper-thyroiditis.  So this was doubly awful. I was loosing weight like crazy, unable to sleep, and having all sorts of symptoms due to my thyroid which also increases anxiety for some, and having anxiety with the two together had me convinced for a while that I had to have cancer or some awful thing happening, because of all my strange symptoms (especially excess weight loss).

It contains a spore/fungus. Ingesting that would be detrimental to the body since spores are exponentially harder to kill than germs or bacteria. 
The only thing you're getting from moldy bread is food poisoning and pain.  Germs/Bacteria that you find on the playground, when you bite your nails or eat without washing your hands, are the ones that boost your immunity because those kind of germs are easy to kill. The body's immune response is enough to form an antibody against that germ.  If you want to prevent the flu or get rid of it quickly, antibiotics would help.

Ok here's a my theory that I learned from 10th grade biology last year. Ok here's how to stronger your immune system.    Eat some infected food, like, moldy bread. 
Just eat anything that has bacteria in it! 
Don't eat to much obviously, the bacteria can overcome your body which can be fatal. 
Just eat enough to get you a bit sick.  Now once you start feeling a bit sick, guess what, your body is producing antibodies to fight off the bacteria that is invading. When you body produces a certain type of antibodies it will "store" the DNA of that antibody and will produce it again if that same bacteria or like it invades again. (So if you want to protect against the flu..simply kiss your wife who already has the flu). 
You body will produce antibodies that fight the flu bacteria or virus.  You will want to take some antibiotics. Antibiotics just stimulate the immune system to create   antibodies. This is a faster way to become immune to a certain bacteria(sickness) If you didn't take antibiotics your bodies antibodies will likely get dominated by the bacteria that you got from your wife! Then you will have to go to the doctor and tell them about what you read from me on Stack. Then he will likely sue, you probably will too. Anyway the doctor will then give you some antibiotics and tell you to get some rest. This theory is mine!  Don't sue me I'm just a 16 year old with no life. 	2017-08-13 18:59:45Z	Gova DEster	-2

Many things that taste bad are in fact bad for you, and many things that you think taste bad, other people like the taste of. When you juice a vegetable or a fruit, the taste is generally stronger in the juice than if you were just to eat it raw. If it's a cherry or an orange, that's considered a feature. If you don't like the taste of beets, then juicing them isn't going to make them taste nicer. However, it can put them in a form where the taste can be hidden - by adding sweet fruit juices, by adding crushed ice (cold reduces the taste of most things) and the like - or it won't last long because you can drink it quickly compared to chewing and swallowing a quantity of solid food. Like all vegetables, beets can be part of a healthy diet. But there is no single vegetable that must be eaten to ensure health. People all over the world go their whole, healthy lives without ever eating a beet, raw or cooked. You didn't specify what health benefits you feel it provides, but I suggest researching a little to find a different vegetable that will give you those benefits with a taste you enjoy. You could also (depending on the benefit you're looking for) consider cooking it differently in the hope of finding a preparation you enjoy. I love borscht made with lots of bacon, onions, and potatoes, and topped with sour cream. I also like dried beet chips topped with sea salt, and grated beets fried in butter with a squeeze of lime juice and some lime zest (a dish we call "Surprise! You Like Beets!" at my house.)

Because it is difficult to stay off of your feet for several weeks to allow the bone to be stable, a boot is sometimes recommended. Which toe it is also matters with regard to treatment. The big toe is responsible for 50% of the utility of all of your toes (source: my orthopedist).  The other 4 toes share the remaining 50%.

I will explain contamination more thoroughly below, but additionally, bacteria in the blood stream (bacteremia) and Sepsis are not the same thing.  You get a transisent bacteremia just brushing your teeth, but you don't get sepsis from it (except in rare rare circumstances).   Second, I will preface this by saying that by explaining why medical errors happen doesn't justify them.  My opinion (and to qualify my opinion, I've spent months of my training in infection control quality improvement) is that infection control is an area in which we have a lot of work to do, as there remain many unacceptable events and outcomes, and failings occur at all steps in the processes.  But that's another discussion. Third, adverse events like lab errors, contamination, medical errors, hospital acquired infections, etc are generally tracked by hospital committees like Infection Control.  I'm not sure if contaminated vials are always watched, but I have seen them discussed in such committees. Fourth, I will address contamination. Is bacteria introduced into the bloodstream? Does that mean the patient now has bacteremia or sepsis? Now to answer directly, yes this only happens when proper infection control protocols are broken.  There are many reasons this might occur. Your question of whether this was a serious breech of protocol is unfortunately subjective.  It all depends on your expectations for human errors/attention/neglect/memory and system errors... and would be a great discussion on PhilosophySE perhaps.  My expectations are perhaps higher than most, and these sort of things upset me, which is why I'm in administrative positions doing things about it. But the question of whether this is not all that uncommon can be answered: correct, it is not uncommon. Would the hospital consider this a serious breech of protocol?  Not likely, although it may be tracked like other errors. But I do not think it is inappropriate to bring your concern about contamination to the hospital, actually.  Reminding them and encouraging raising standards is important, IMHO. All this said, if she feels sick or develops a fever, regardless of what they said, she should be re-evaluated by a clinician to say whether anything more should be done.  Hopefully this is all in the past at this point.	2017-08-10 10:37:45Z	DoctorWhom	1

The internal carotid artery goes inside the skull.   You couldn't compress the skull with sunglasses if you tried.   , not the brain. Putting pressure on the temporal regions can cause pain in the muscles, and sustained pressure can cause spasms.  Restricting the flow through the arteries of your face could in theory reduce flow to muscles of your scalp, causing pain and ischemia.  It is less likely to be the cause of pain from sunglasses pressure, as there is lots of collateral blood flow, but not impossible. Note that transmitting any force through the actual skull via compression, which is a pretty solid bone, would take a great deal of pressure (orders of magnitude above what sunglasses are capable of) and would involve fracturing bone.

Skin is elastic, remember, so over time it'll shrink or expand as necessary but if you're losing weight too quickly, your skin won't have the time it needs to adapt. When losing weight, you'll obviously be working to decrease your calorie intake to a deficit of what your body needs to maintain the weight but this has to be measured carefully if you're going to stay healthy when losing. The recommended calorie deficit per day for healthy weight loss is 500 calories less than TDEE (total daily energy expenditure). So if your TDEE calories is 1875 (the calories you need to consume to maintain your weight), then you'll want to aim for a maximum daily intake of 1375 calories. You can consider calories lost during exercise as "bonus calories." Consuming too few calories per day when losing weight will mean you'll lose weight faster which could cause hanging skin. Keep your calorie intake per day while losing weight to 500 calories less than you need to maintain your weight for healthy weight loss which will avoid the hanging skin problem.	2017-07-27 10:16:25Z	Ortund	1

Only your doctor can answer this question based on an evaluation of your medical conditions, medications, allergies, and physical exam.   What I can do is guide you toward the right resources. Make a list of these things you are on, a list of your medical history, a list of medication or food reactions you've had in the past, and what you wrote in the question.  Take it with you to the doctor. Because of the supplements you take and diagnosis of Leaky Gut, I would recommend a doctor who practices functional medicine or a doctor of naturopathy - at least in the USA.  I know for a fact that most MD/DO training does not cover very many alternative medications and supplements.  Part of the reason is that there is limited evidence about some of them, part is that they are not always regulated or safe, and part is that the pharmaceutical industry tends to dominate what is taught in med school (they generate the most evidence through extensive research that costs big $$).   Treatments of ANY kind range in evidence of effectiveness from 0 to extremely strong, depending on what quality research is able to show us. There IS evidence for safety and efficacy of many alt meds/supplements, but I am not an expert in which resources those are.   That is why I point you to one of those specialists who DO use those resources regularly.  I have met and listened to a number of very knowledgeable and evidence-based doctors of naturopathy and functional medicine doctors, but that does not mean that all of them practice strongly evidence-based medicine. I recommend that you request that the doctor provide you with the resources that support their recommendations so that you can read further and educate yourself on them. Medication interaction checkers exist online, but there are a couple caveats.  One, they might not be accurate with supplements (or even have them listed).  Two, there is no way to input your medical history.  If you have damaged your liver drinking, for example, your liver enzymes may not work right and medications can build up or behave differently.  This is why you need a doctor to talk with you for your individual case. Good luck with your learning process.  It is good that you are asking these questions about safety and your health!

In terms of the cardiovascular diseases like high blood pressure associated with high NaCl intake,cutting down NaCl from the diet(that is making the food less saltier) or increasing the dietary intake of K+ through K+ rich fruits or vegetables could prove to be extremely useful but replacing NaCl with KCl without recommendation could cause side effects. As we are aware that hypokalemia (low K+ in the blood)  increases the risk but hyperkalemia (high K+ in the blood) too can cause the same.
 Salt substitutes having high quantities of K+ in the form of KCl and KI and little amount of Na+ are considered to be better than having only KCl as the main component.The former donot help to eliminate Na+ from the diet but helps to maintain a high proportion of K+ to a low proportion of Na+ also they are a source of iodine. The kidneys are very sensitive to high K+ in the blood and ECF  thus efficiently excrete them.

Source: I'm a medical student who has PCOS.  The long answer: While on birth control pills, menstrual cycles are entirely controlled by the pills. This means that if the patient takes the pills religiously, their menstrual cycles will be regular, with their period happening exactly when specified by the pills. PCOS is a complex disease with many underlying factors, including genetics and lifestyle (e.g. obesity). Many of its symptoms, including acne and irregular periods, can be controlled by birth control pills, but the underlying genetic issues will still be present and often the underlying lifestyle issues will still be present. Therefore, when a patient with birth control pills stops taking the pills, if they have not done anything else in their life to reduce their PCOS, it is likely that their former symptoms will return. This means if they previously had irregular periods they will probably get irregular periods again.  The exception would be if they have made some kind of lifestyle change to reduce their PCOS, such as losing weight. Weight loss can normalize hormone levels and help with PCOS symptoms (e.g. "most treatments of obesity...achieve modest reductions in weight and improvements in PCOS phenotype", see  ). Weight loss can sometimes restore fertility in PCOS patients who have lower fertility due to PCOS. Here's my personal experience: I had PCOS, diagnosed by an endocrinologist via an ovarian ultrasound, clinical history, and blood tests. My periods were EXTREMELY irregular. I had a normal BMI but it was on the "high side" of normal. I learned in medical school about how PCOS is tied in with sugar consumption (high sugar consumption -> high insulin -> higher androgens -> worse PCOS, e.g.  ). I also learned that consequently PCOS is sometimes treated with metformin, a diabetes drug. Instead of taking a drug, I eliminated white and brown sugar from my diet and limited myself to an appropriate number of calories per day. I also exercise for an hour a day. Consequently, I lost 25 pounds (current BMI = 20, which is low end of normal) and my PCOS symptoms have entirely vanished: I have clockwork periods, and a recent ultrasound of my ovaries showed no cysts, so I no longer meet ANY of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Because I have "cured" my PCOS through lifestyle changes, as long as I continue the lifestyle changes I am "cured" of PCOS. In contrast, I know someone who is taking birth control pills to hide their PCOS symptoms, and if they stop taking the pills their symptoms do come back. Note - everyone is physiologically unique, and so people respond to lifestyle changes to a different degree. Diet and exercise are great, but may not always "cure" someone - the best resource is to talk to your own physician. 	2017-07-19 15:12:52Z	veritessa	2

When there is an infection, the body makes more white blood cells to fight of the infection. When there is a suspicion of an infection, the doctor will look at the WBC count (together with the CRP count, another sign of infection) to see how likely it is that there is an infection. If necessary, this can help aid in the decision to prescribe antibiotics. When there is a too low count of WBCs the body is at risk of infections. The immune system will not function fully. This can be potentially lifethreatening if the WBC count is very low. For example, this is what happens in HIV or due to chemotherapy. However, a high WBC count is not always functional. Sometimes a high WBC count is caused by other things, such as bone tumors or leukemia. More information can be found  .	2017-07-17 13:42:01Z	Tami	1

This brand's website has a section on this: Real answer: "What the hell, we won't tell!" Of course, the real pH depends not only on the other salts in the water but on what exactly is used for flavouring it. If it is citric acid for example, and all too often it is, then chances for a drink low in acidity dwindle fast. It is really a pity and disgrace that "sparkling water" often refers to acidified flavoured sparkling water. Regarding dental health these are quite different. Not only single expert opinions support this view. Some studies that support the  That has to be put into perspective. Even citric acid is not the devil. The pH is not everything.

Companies adding needlessly such superfluous ingredients like citric or other acids to "sparkling water" should be held responsible for diluting the meaning of that term and sued if they continue to sell this with a misleading claim like "healthy", since all around these flavoured waters are apparently not tooth friendly.  Not drinking them might be one sane option.  Insisting to ingest might warrant the following precautionary measures:  Copied from the Chicago Tribune article: The company does not release pH levels for its products. Given the question's interest in lime, lemon it is quite reasonable to assume a significant amount of citric acid used or the "flavour". This will bring down the pH-level to significantly lower than real, unflavoured water.  If it does not contain citric acid or similar compounds under the label of so-called "flavour" then another indicator is the fact that it does not contain any sodium. The less minerals such a water contains, the more pronounced the resulting pH from the added carbonic acid. Let me be bold and cast an educated guess: the pH level will be well below 4.

When the next layers underneath the husk (the bran layer and the germ) are removed, leaving mostly the starchy endosperm,white rice is produced. Several vitamins ,dietary minerals and essential fatty acids  are lost in this removal and the subsequent polishing process.Vitamins lost are-B1,B3 ,traces of vitamin A and E.Minerals lost are iron,magnesium etc.Essential fatty acids in the bran oil and fibres are also lost. Germinated brown rice is nutritionally better because germination activates various enzymes in the rice, giving rise to a more complete amino acid profile, including GABA. Fortified rice has been produced with the help of biotechnology which is fortified with traces of the lost minerals,vitamins and other substances into the starchy grain matter itself.Such bio fortified white rice may be nutritious.One such is called   which is fortified with added micronutrients. Another measure is parboiling the rice before polishing.Parboiling helps the minerals and vitamins to be impregnated to some extent into the  starchy grain.

Since your question relates to ATLS directly and shock indirectly, let's start from the beginning. For the first stage of shock, the textbook answer is that the blood pressure is not lowered and the heart rate is not elevated. Urine output is normal. The body compensates by altered vascular tone. With disease or medication, this may be changed. The patient may be on vasodilatory agents for blood pressure that prevent physiologic vasoconstriction. For the second stage of shock, the textbook answer is that the blood pressure is maintained but the heart rate is elevated, urine output starts to decrease. What if your patient is on a rate-limiting calcium-channel blocker or beta-blocker and cannot mount a tachycardic response? What if they are on diuretics and a decrease in renal blood flow still results in a normal appearing urine output? For the third stage of shock, the textbook answer is that heart rate is elevated but now blood pressure is low with the urine output compromised. Physiologically (regarding tissue perfusion), a patient on antihypertensives may go from normal right to here. They cannot vasoconstrict or mount a tachycardic response due to multiple antihypertensive agents. One good insult and they are hypoperfused. For the fourth stage of shock, the textbook answer is that heart rate is significantly elevated, blood pressure is low, and urine output is almost zero. Aside from the elevated heart rate, this could be your end-stage renal disease patient after hemodialysis on a good day. Numbers are neat when trending over time in one patient, but you are seeing a 90 pound 95 year-old in the trauma bay with a heart rate of 120 and a blood pressure of 84/40 after a motor vehicle collision. You never met her before. She is confused. Is she in shock or is she demented? Is she hypovolemic or is she just anxious and her blood pressure is normal for her? Big picture is you need more data and you need to trend the data you have over time, even if that is a brief amount of time. The more important thing to remember is that, in general, pediatric trauma patients have much better physiologic reserves than geriatric trauma patients. Older patients crash sooner but you may have more time to intervene. Younger patients seem fine until they aren't, and then at that point they are near death.	2018-01-28 08:28:01Z	RudyB	1

If the "acid reflux" and the "allergies" treatments have not helped, it's good for you to continue to investigate so you can get some relief. It's not good for you to decide it's the worst possible thing, that will just upset you for no benefit. Keep communicating with your family doctor that you want to know what is causing the cough and you want to clear it up and get relief. Sticking with one doctor and going from them to a specialist and then back again is probably the best way to build trust, compared to going to a series of different specialists who can argue with each other through you. If you think your family doctor would let you die from tumours rather than help you, you need a different family doctor. But if it's just a matter that you can't shake your fear, work with your doctor to get that settled.	2017-07-14 16:34:57Z	Kate Gregory	3

Huge issue with his advice - the large majority of strokes are due to a clot or another form of vessel blockage. The rest caused by a hemorrhage (you'll have the worst headache of your life) while bleeding profusely internally. Watch for these signs and symptoms if you think you or someone else may be having a stroke. Note when your signs and symptoms begin, because the length of time they have been present may guide your treatment decisions:  if you notice any signs or symptoms of a stroke, even if they seem to fluctuate or disappear. Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Don't wait to see if symptoms go away. Every minute counts. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability. If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain is interrupted or reduced. This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die. A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA). About 85 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). The most common ischemic strokes include: Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or
   ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that
   affect your blood vessels, including uncontrolled high blood pressure
   (hypertension), overtreatment with anticoagulants and weak spots in
   your blood vessel walls (aneurysms). A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an abnormal
   tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation)
   present at birth. Types of hemorrhagic stroke include:
 -   In an intracerebral hemorrhage, a blood vessel in the brain bursts and spills into the surrounding brain
   tissue, damaging brain cells. Brain cells beyond the leak are
   deprived of blood and also damaged. High blood pressure, trauma, vascular malformations, use of blood-thinning medications and other conditions may cause an intracerebral hemorrhage. A transient ischemic attack (TIA) — also known as a ministroke — is a brief period of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke. A temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain causes TIAs, which often last less than five minutes. Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris blocks blood flow to part of your brain. A TIA doesn't leave lasting symptoms because the blockage is temporary. Seek emergency care even if your symptoms seem to clear up. Having a TIA puts you at greater risk of having a full-blown stroke, causing permanent damage later. If you've had a TIA, it means there's likely a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain or a clot source in the heart. It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or a TIA based only on your symptoms. Up to half of people whose symptoms appear to go away actually have had a stroke causing brain damage.	2017-07-11 05:42:58Z	Mike-DHSc	6

During menopause hormone levels fluctuate and ovulation may not occur regularly and periods are more spaced out or closer together, heavier or lighter. Some months women do not ovulate at all and don't have a period. There are two main hormones that regulate the lining of the uterus- estrogen ("the fertilizer") and progesterone ("the lawn mower"). During perimenopause women are still producing these two hormones but sometimes they aren't in the same proportion to each other as they were during younger years. If there's more estrogen than progesterone the lining of the uterus thickens and at some point it's shed (spotting) even if there isn't ovulation. To answer your question, spotting could be counted as a period if you are in perimenopause. However, if you haven't had ANY bleeding for 12 months and then have spotting you should check with your doctor.	2017-12-06 13:33:19Z	Kate Gregory	2

12868	12869	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12869	First of all, nothing is immune to anything, just resistant, and resisitance itself varies. If you develop a bacterial or viral disease, your body will develop antibodies against it. This makes you resistant to the bacteria or virus, but not immune. If you are exposed to a sufficient quantity of that same agent, you will develop the disease again. This is true for antibiotic-resistance, as well. So...when you take antibiotics for some bacterial disease, some small percentage of those bacteria may be naturally resistant to the bacterium simply because of genetic mutation, may have developed strategies that allow it to mutate in response to environmental stimuli, or have borrowed it from cross-breeding . When you start taking the antibiotic, it kills off the non-resistant bacterial population first, which is generally the vast majority if it. Normally, you are prescribed a sufficient amount of antibiotic to kill off the whole bacterial population. The problem arises when people stop the antibiotic regimen because they're feeling fine and see no reason for taking the remaining prescription. This leaves behind the resistant bacteria. And if your immune system doesn't take care of the rest, you will redevelop the disease, and it will then be resistant the that antibiotic. Not only that, but you will then spread that antibiotic-resistant bacteria to others. Depending on the strength of the bacteria's resistance the disease may nor may not need to be treated with a different antibiotic, but most likely it will. If treated with the same antibiotic, the dosage and/or duration will need to be increased. Here's a  . Note: by mentioning viruses I do not mean to imply that antibiotics may be used to treat viral infections.

Intake of tryptophan rich food like milk ,,egg yolk and legume help in the formation of neurotransmitter serotonin which is thought to be involved in the memory pathways.Intake of choline containing food like eggs,liver,peanuts,spinach,beet,wheat,shell fish etc helps improve acetylcholine formation. 2)The neuronal tissue is broadly segregated into white matter and grey matter.
Compounds like galactocerebrosides are more common in the white matter composition and gangliosides in the grey matter.
Intake of galactose rich food like milk,
essential fatty acids like linolenic acids,rich in walnut oil,soyabean oil,marine fish oils and linolenic acids in safflower and peanut oils help improve the functioning of these tissues. Also amino acids like cysteine,methionine and serine are essentially helpful in maintaining the health of the nervous system. 3)The nervous system can generate ATP for conduction of impulses only from glucose.So the proper intake of glucose plays an important role too in reducing fatigue. 4)Electrolytes like Na+,K+ are important for conduction of impulses.So they should be considered for intake but in proper quantities. 5)Vitamin B1,B6 is essential for a healthy nervous system.Food like yeast,liver,cereal grains,lentils,fish are rich in both of them.	2017-07-03 09:48:04Z	Catharanthus	1

Before listing citations to some relevant studies, some brief background information will provide important context for you and others reading this thread. As you know, the body breaks down carbohydrates (sugars, starches, fiber) into glucose. Consequently, health professionals encourage diabetic patients to not only monitor total carbohydrate intake, but also the   of carbohydrates consumed as well.  One of the most common ways to gauge the impact of a carbohydrate on glucose levels is the   (GI), and its companion   (GL). I mention this fact because while sweet foods, e.g., candy bars, cake, ice cream, etc., tend to have a high glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), this is not always the case (e.g., watermelon is sweet, but has a low GL), and non-sweet foods high in starch can carry a high glycemic load.   on the Mayo Clinic website.

"The Glycemic Index (GI) is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.

Relation of total sugars, fructose and sucrose with incident type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.  (20), E711–E720.  BACKGROUND: Sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with type 2 diabetes. To assess whether this association holds for the fructose-containing sugars they contain, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library (through June 2016). We included prospective cohort studies that assessed the relation of fructose-containing sugars with incident type 2 diabetes. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data and assessed risk of bias. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) using random effects meta-analyses. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. RESULTS: Fifteen prospective cohort studies (251 261 unique participants, 16 416 cases) met the eligibility criteria, comparing the highest intake (median 137, 35.2 and 78 g/d) with the lowest intake (median 65, 9.7 and 25.8 g/d) of total sugars, fructose and sucrose, respectively. Although there was no association of total sugars (RR 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.09) or fructose (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84-1.29) with type 2 diabetes, sucrose was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98). Our confidence in the estimates was limited by evidence of serious inconsistency between studies for total sugars and fructose, and serious imprecision in the pooled estimates for all 3 sugar categories. INTERPRETATION: Current evidence does not allow us to conclude that fructose-containing sugars independent of food form are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Further research is likely to affect our estimates. CITATION: Reeds, J., Mansuri, S., Mamakeesick, M., Harris, S. B., Zinman, B., Gittelsohn, J., … Hanley, A. (2016).

Next, starches (such as potatoes and breads) slowly convert to sugar in the mouth due to amylase in saliva. Even worse, starches are better than straight up sugary liquids at sticking to teeth, which means that eating potatoes or bread and leaving the pieces in your mouth over the day could be worse for your teeth than a sugar-sweetened tea or coffee (where the sugar will tend to be washed away quickly).

They often think about the pleasure they feel when they are on the drug and have a powerful desire to feel it again.  This can be true for both of the above. Nitrous Oxide IS actually used as a street drug where it's called "Whip-Its" and has harmful side effects.  Benzos and other sedatives are sold on the street as well, and also have serious side effects and potentially fatal withdrawal. If you're worried whether you're physically addicted because they gave it to you once, no. If you're just thinking "that felt nice," that's not addiction either. But if you're considering finding a way to achieve that feeling again (via Nitrous Oxide or another chemical), then you're starting the walk down the path to psychological addiction.

Knowing the above plus how much caffeine you've ingested will allow you to plot caffeine levels over time. Given the wide variation in half-life, I'm going to ignore the 99% absorption and treat it as 100%.

All human infesting lice species are parasites that depend not only on skin contact for nutrition but on certain types of fibres to dwell, to hide, to travel  and to procreate. Eradicating this natural habitat on a large scale is very likely too destructive and radical for the lice to adapt quickly enough to such a new situation. But there is also a problem: These little parasites are highly adaptable and while not that robust in general, the amount of fibre, fabric or hair they need to breed is really minimal. It is therefore likely that we might be able to not only reduce the lice problem, but to eradicate them completely. But only by going naked and

Therefore, once lactase has converted a lactose molecule into galactose and glucose, it is free to split another. According to  , lactase can split up to sixty lactose molecules each second, so two lactase molecules can split 120; 4, 240; 16, 960. and so on. IOW, the more the lactase, the faster the conversion.   provides a graphics that demonstrate how enzymes work.   So to answer your question, yes, there is enough lactase present in a lactose-free product to further catalyze any lactose present in any added dairy products. Whether or not there is enough to catalyze that lactose before it passes into the large intestines is another matter, however. When lactase is added to regular dairy products, they're allowed to "ferment" for several hours. Since lactose is not cheap, only enough lactase is added to catalyze a given quantity of lactose in a certain amount of time. My guess is that there will still be a significant amount of lactose present before it's passed into one's large intestines, where it causes the symptoms of lactose intolerance.  
There is a lactase enzyme sold on   that can be added to regular milk. It requires five drops for sixteen ounces of milk. If my calculations are correct, it works out to 0.8 ml per gallon of milk.

Dogs are responsible for the vast majority of bites, hospitalizations, and deaths, but there's some suggestion that when cats do bite, it's more likely to cause serious problems, but the numbers of cat bites are small, so it's hard to say for sure. Statistically, dogs are are the cause of 85% - 90% of bites in the US, and ~50% of those bites are unprovoked.  Cats are responsible for 5% - 10% of bites, and close to 100% of those bites are provoked.   Neither cats nor dogs are known for their dental hygiene, so both cat and dog bites are at high risk for infection.  There's also a chance, especially in older animals, that some portion of the tooth breaks off and is left in the bite wound.  It seems that cat bites are more likely to be deep puncture wounds than dog bites, and, as such are more likely to cause a serious infection, but cat bites are also much rarer than dog bites. With cat bites, some people can go into anaphylactic shock, which is less likely with dog bites.

Bruising is caused by the blood that escapes the broken capillaries. In a "recurring blunt force trauma" those capillaries are not allowed to heal.

Now regarding the   underneath all this, there's   which states that bone in a healthy person or animal will adapt to the loads under which it is placed. If loading on a particular bone increases, the bone will remodel itself over time to become stronger to resist that sort of loading.

However, if you are experiencing hair loss, there is a procedure that is done by dermatologists called PRP. 
PRP or Platelet Rich Plasma is a procedure where a Dermatologist would draw about 100cc of blood from your arm, then run it through a centrifuge for about 15 minutes. The blood separates into 4 different levels. The Top layer is the Plasma, which is the layer that the dermatologist takes (About 50-70cc) and injects it back into the scalp, stimulating hair follicle growth. Many of my patients are very happy with the results, however the procedure is never covered by any insurance, and costs around $500. Worth it though.

12672	12679	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12679	Your GP clearly has no understanding of Physics, nor of Anthropology. Firstly as the other answer points out, millions of people carry their babies like this in tropical climates and have done for hundreds of thousands of years. It's fairly insulting to presume that they must have been so stupid as to suffer great harm coming to their babies without doing anything to alter their habits. As to the physics, according to the second law of thermodynamics (Clausius's statement), heat will always pass from an area of higher temperature to an area of lower temperature. Consider that the only way in which baby might be in danger of getting too hot in either case, is if the outside temperature were high enough that it's ability to lose heat to the outside was compromised. That means that it's degree of contact with the outside air is irrelevant as that is causing the problem in the first place. Because of the second law of thermodynamics, when you put two bodies of different temperature together, they will homogenise to the same temperature, essentially becoming one unit. We have biological mechanisms to maintain homoeostasis. Presuming a healthy father, the adult's mechanisms will be more efficient than the baby's (they have a larger surface area to loose heat over and their heat loss system will be fully developed). By putting the two bodies together, therefore, the baby is becoming part of a system which is overall more efficient at losing temperature than it was on it's own. Another way of looking at the second law is that the baby can only pick up heat from the adult if it started off cooler than the adult, why would it have done that if both are in the same environment? Of course if the sling were made out of an insulating material, then heat could get trapped in that part of the adult's body which would comprise the entirety of the baby's body and so could cause some harm. Charitably, I suppose that's what the GP might have been thinking about, but you just need a less insulating sling material.	2017-06-18 07:21:30Z	Isaacson	3
12672	12678	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12678	This is basically a physics question, actually.  Let's assume father and infant both start out at 37C core temperatures.  The baby is placed against father's chest. Due to their size differences, about 40% of the baby's skin surface is in contact with the father while only about 10% of the father's body is in contact with the baby (estimated using  ).  When they're both the same temperature nothing happens. But let's suppose one of them starts getting hotter than the other. What happens then? If it's dad, he becomes a big heat source for baby since he's in contact with 40% of baby's skin surface and a much larger body. He can only make it harder for baby to stay cool. If it's baby, baby can't radiate heat from 40% of his body surface, making cooling much harder. So I think the answer is your GP was right. (Meanwhile, millions of people around the world in tropical climates strap their infants to their body and go work in the fields all day long with no apparent harmful effects.)	2017-06-18 05:20:40Z	Carey Gregory	1

But vitamin D in the skin is also broken down by UV irradiation and this leads to a maximum equilibrium level of vitamin D in the skin of the order of 25,000 IU (different sources will give different figures of this maximum value,  ). But this does not mean that you can get 25,000 IU per day from the Sun, because it takes a few days for the vitamin D in your skin to be transported to the liver where it gets converted to calcidiol. The maximum daily dose of vitamin D you can get from the Sun is estimated to be about 10,000 IU/day,  . So, if you expose your body to UV radiation from the Sun for the first time since last summer, then you can produce 25,000 IU in your skin, but by the next day only 10,000 IU will has been taken away from there, this means that with 15,000 IU still left in the skin you can only add 10,000 IU until you're back at the maximum of 25,000 IU. This also means that to get a high dose of vitamin D, you don't need to expose your skin to the Sun every day. If we pretend that lower amounts of vitamin D in the skin don't affect the speed at which it is removed, then the body would be able to extract 20,000 IU in two days from the 25,000 IU, the amount of vitamin D left under your skin is then 5000 IU, exposing your skin to the Sun will add back that 20,000 IU. In reality, with lower amounts of vitamin D in the skin you'll extract less from it per unit time, so you won't get 10,000 IU/day if you go into the Sun every other day, but it's not going to be a factor of two lower as one could naively expect. 	2017-06-15 23:50:45Z	Count Iblis	2

If you shower right after sun exposure, you will reduce some of your D3 because it is synthesized at skin level & then absorbed.  It is possible for a human to make 50,000iu in a day.  There are always factors in play, such as complexion, tanning, and global location that will impact exactly how much a given person makes.  There have been studies where this is attempted to be measured, but even in situations where they exposed 2 people to the same thing, they had one person with 20ng higher blood values than the other, and that is significantly higher.  Personally I live in a Northern climate so I just supplement year round.  If you take D3 (not D2) it is all coming from natural sources & will operate within your body just as effectively as sunshine.  I also supplement my children from birth.  I can't swear it works,  but I can say we have never needed a sick visit to a doctor other than one time for one child for excessive vomiting, which I have never thought D3 could prevent.  We do not experience typical childhood illness at all & we are not particularly careful other than to aim for a very high nG value on bloodwork because I happen to personally believe it matters for immune system functioning.  So what we take is well in excess of what is generally recommended, but it's all completely approved through our Drs & all have been extremely happy that we are taking the levels we are taking.  I can also say I am the only parent I know of multiple children who completely skipped early infant illnesses.  I worked too, so they weren't home all day with me, but none of my children ran so much as a fever or runny nose before age 2.  They didn't inherit that.  Their parents both were the typically sick children that you anticipate all kids will be, lots of coughs, colds, general stuff.  Here is some info on the various nG levels that were found for various people under the same situations/exposures.  Here is a lot of information on how D3 impacts immune functions.  Sorry I cannot be more accurate to determine precisely what a given person would make in a given situation.  I do not think bodies work like that though.  It seems on the studies I have come across, similarly sized people of the same complexion & same exposure still manage to synthesize it differently enough to be notable.  It's relatively easy & inexpensive to get your blood tested for D3, at least where I live, so if you are truly curious about your own production, you can certain request testing.  I think all people should be checked at least yearly.  It's such an important nutrient.  It behaves much more like a hormone than a vitamin & there is a receptor for D3 on nearly every tissue & cell type in your body.  It impacts all things, from immune health to brain development & function, to heart health.  So I think on the whole, we are missing the mark medically when we so rarely test it & recommend such low supplementation while living in an era where people see less sunshine that likely ever before. 	2017-06-15 03:55:38Z	threetimes	0

Unfortunately, the above answer is all based on my guessing; but seems like it would be fun to experiment with. However, the below answer and link will give you instructions to make a DIY manikin that a CPR instructor has made and uses.  With some patience, time and approximately $14 USD, you can make a manikin out of a plunger, lid, foam, plaster of Paris and a few other common items. I will not go into detail about it, but   is a link to the blog where you can find detailed instructions, pictures and a list of materials.  You mention having the children practice some skills on a human. As long as they are old enough to understand the concept of not actually doing these skills on a person who doesn't need them, I encourage you to teach them on a human. Teach them the anatomical landmarks, how to check for breathing and a pulse and how to open an airway(1) on a real person.  Hope this is helpful to you. If you have any additional questions, please let me know!  (1)   If you plan to teach them how to open an airway, be sure to only do the head-tilt chin-lift. If you wish to teach the jaw thrust, that is best done on a doll. 	2017-06-14 14:40:29Z	Narusan-in-coma	8

I do not know what the deal is with this deserted stack exchange, but I will try my best because I found it worrying what you wrote. You do not have time for some moderate Cardio 30 minutes three times a week? Cardio, not some walking. Forget trackers for the amount of steps, they do not work. You have to do your sport in your room? How is it a waste of time if you want to lose weight? How does one even study with that intensity? Here is my advice: Track every calorie you eat and try to end up with a deficit of 300-500 every single day. There are a couple of apps that can help or you can do it the old school way with pen and paper. You will not lose weight unless you are at a deficit.  I really wonder what you have to study so hard for. I ended up with almost perfect grades at your age and still had the time to lose more than 30 kg with sport, but I also grew up in a Western country where school is really easy. Push ups burn almost no calories, be aware of that. Just walking does a little bit, but it is all too easy to just eat what you have burned in a couple of hours. You will even see that in the long run, instead of making you tired that sport will help you study. Your life has just begun, in 20 years you will run into some serious problems if you do not run enough now.  Also, do not expect fast results. First you lose water and so on and not fat and then your weight will no longer change for a while. This will take some time - we are talking about almost a year here. So long story short: Track everything (except your steps). This isn't rocket science. If you are a hard studier, you should have no problem with doing some simple calculations.	2017-06-14 15:17:46Z	user9530	0
12604	12609	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12609	The problem with treating "the common cold" is that it's really a large collection of similar illnesses caused by completely different strains of virus. The effects are similar, but the causes are different. Any treatment for one type would likely be ineffective against many of the others. Here are some stats from  : To have a completely effective vaccine, you'd need to have as many strains as possible in either a single vaccine or a series of them, and that's simply not easy. It could be impossible. That said, there are ongoing efforts, as always. A couple different paths have been taken; I've given an example for each. One technique is to simply stuff as many strains into a vaccine as possible. An attempt I've seen mentioned quite a lot is  . They tested a vaccine on macaques (monkeys, not too different from humans) and found that certain antibodies were produced in response to types of human rhinovirus. They attempted to use 50 strains at once in the vaccine, which is quite impressive, and got good results for 49 out of those 50. There have also been other attempts in recent years.   went on a different path, using a specific protein found when viruses invade cells as a vaccination in mice. This has the advantage that it can be used to train the immune system against many different strains; one protein can serve as a vaccine against dozens of types of viruses. A few years back, a group at MIT ( ) developed a technique called Double-stranded RNA [dsRNA] Activated Caspase
Oligomerizer (DRACO). DRACO essentially gets infected cells to shut themselves down - killing themselves - to stop the infection from spreading. After all, viruses need cells to reproduce. So far, DRACO has worked in mice, defeating over a dozen types of viruses. All of these approaches need testing! Human subjects have not yet been used; the closest any have gotten have been macaques, as well as isolated human cells. Additionally, no treatment has been tested against more than a fraction of rhinoviruses and other strains. There's absolutely no guarantee that any of this will work, but it's certainly steps in the right direction.  I've taken this from the "home invasion alarm" analogy used in  .	2017-06-12 18:33:31Z	HDE 226868	5

If you don't feel that you are getting the help you need, you can talk about this to your therapist. This is a great advantage of getting help in person over getting help over the internet: therapy can and should be customised to your needs. For a therapist to do that, they need your help. The best way to help them and your self is to communicate your concerns. However, people are different - both doctors and patients. If after a while you don't think that there is any improvement, you should feel free to look for another therapist. 
When looking for a therapist you should feel free to ask questions. Aside from asking for credentials and fees, Mayo Clinic staff article (also quoted by NAMI) recommends asking about your therapist's:  A therapist who specialises in your type of problems is more likely to have the necessary experience to help you.

Your body consumes calories even at rest, our body requires calories to operate at all time(heart-beat, respiration, etc.). I am going to say what all people say about weight losing strategy. Obviously the application you are using is misleading and the most effective strategy to pay attention to what you are going to eat. "Do sports and do not eat more than you need". As a postman, I can imagine you walk with a heavy bag every weekday, but the main factor in consuming your own calories is the intensity of your activity, you can walk slowly or in normal speed for 1 hour, the calories burnt/used are nowhere near race-walking for 30 minutes. This could be a problem, if you boost yourself with naughty stuff in short interval between diet and assuming that naughty stuff is a low quality calories food, you are not going to lose weight. Your body will store extra calories when you have more than you need, low quality calories provides high calories and does not fill your stomach well enough. If you are hungry, try something else. If you wish to lose weight, then pay attention to nutrition label, not only the calories, but the other nutrition like fat and sugar. Usually you won't find nutrition label in restaurant, but you should be able to determine what is good and bad for your nutrition goal. You will be more experienced as you try, I managed to go from 40" belly to 34" in a year by myself using the same strategies I typed. Resistance training can help too, but for this topic, you look for information in relationship between nutrition and resistance training.	2017-06-15 03:05:11Z	Junior Programmer	0

The CRP test is a general test to check for inflammation in the body. It is not a specific test. That means it can reveal that you have inflammation somewhere in your body, but it cannot pinpoint the exact location. Basically, they measure how long red blood cells (erythrocytes) take to travel down a thin  tube. This is a very solid indication whether one is pregnant or not. It can also help to asses the health of the fetus. If one is not pregnant, it is highly probable that there are problems with the liver if a high amount of AFP can be found in the blood. This protein is usually only produced in the fetus, so a high level of CEA in the blood can be linked to cancer.

The walker will also (if the brakes are on) serve as a device to help him get up. As well, any mobility aid tells onlookers "this person has a medical condition." If he looks too young to fall down for medical reasons, people may assume he is drunk or high, and feel a reluctance to help him. You can overcome his walker resistance by telling him it's not for him to walk with, it's for him to get back up with. This   has fall prevention tips and suggests a conversation with a doctor on what aid might be most useful. There is also   that cites studies of strength and balance training and Tai Chi, along with changing medications and glasses, as ways to reduce falls. Certainly being stronger and having good balance would also help for getting up from a fall.

I'm sorry to say that some people are simply a "tough stick" and there's not much you can do about it. For example, I have a friend who looks like he should be an easy stick. He's athletic, muscular, with very little body fat, and those types usually have pipelines for veins that you can hit from 50 feet away--  but not him. He suffered an MI recently and the paramedics ended up having to use his external jugular to get an IV. (And when paramedics can't get an IV on you, you are definitely a tough stick.) The only thing I can think to add to your list is to get the arm lower than your body. Let it hang off the edge of the bed for a minute or two before they try. You want all those veins as engorged as possible. Definitely keep track of which veins work and which ones don't. Sometimes veins look good but they're not, or vice versa. It helps if the patient knows from past experience. If push comes to shove, there are other ways. They can use the external jugular like the medics did on my friend, they could place an indwelling catheter that remains in place for months, or they can even do a cutdown, but a nurse isn't going to have the authority to do any of those things so you would have to bring the issue up with the doctor. 	2017-06-03 22:25:30Z	Carey Gregory	2

In other words, the consumption of sugar-laden, low-nutrient foods.  Sugary drinks form a fine example, from pops to fruit juices: In an 8 fl. oz. serving of cranberry juice, I might consume 35g sugar. I don't get any protein, or fiber, but I get a fine dose of vitamin C; you get your 100% recommended daily value of vitamin C from a variety of sources. So I consumed 35g of sugar and I didn't consume anything else.

Because of their structures, sugars are metabolised more quickly in the body compared to complex carbohydrates.  Therefore, sugars get turned into glucose more quickly for energy use, hence the term "sugar rush" from the build up of energy in the body.  Any unused glucose will end up as fat and stored in the body's fat reserves. What makes complex carbs different is that they are starches formed by longer saccharide chains, which means they take longer to break down. Chemically, they usually comprise of three or more linked sugars. Whole grain starches include the wheat grain and kernel which provide the majority of fibre and nutrients to be found in starchy foods. When it comes to picking starchy foods, such as rice, bread and any other products made from flour, it’s best to opt for whole grain versions of these products. We should not rely too much on carbohydrate though.  Whilst whole grain foods impact upon blood glucose levels more slowly than other forms of carbohydrate, higher levels of carbohydrate can still raise blood sugar levels substantially.  So whilst aiming for complex carbohydrates rather than simple carbs, you still need to keep within the recommended daily calorie intake and ratios of carbs to other nutrients such as vitamins and fibre.	2017-06-20 08:12:27Z	Chris	1

They are not prescribed for illness and shouldn't be taken as such as over-dosage causes hyper-vitaminosis or vitamin toxicity.
Having said that, I think you meant to say that the RDA is 90mg(as 90g is way too high). I'm aware that this value is different depending on the country as well as the type of person. 
The reason why vitamin supplements are available in high doses is because these are meant to be used for deficiency syndromes(sometimes they're used as placebos as well). They are meant to replenish the lost stores of vitamins in the body. Also note that 1000mg of oral vitamin C does not mean that your body will absorb 100% of it. Infact in 1000mg of oral vitamin C, only about 50% is absorbed by the body. This is what is referred to as "bio-availability." This is because a series of metabolic activities take place in the body, and about 50% is absorbed and 50% is excreted [please note that bioavailability of different drugs will be different]. 
There is also no point in making vitamin supplements to contain the exact RDA as required as 
(a) You would have consumed the RDA equivalent if you are eating a balanced diet 
(b) Hence there is no need to create a supplement as such 
(c)  For 90mg of vitamin C to be absorbed by the body, the dosage of the supplement should around 125mg(here at lower doses bioavailability of vitamin C is around 70-80%). This does not help people will deficiency syndromes	2017-05-30 20:21:20Z	Chikku	-1

But the reason that it is treated so seriously is that if you contract rabies it will invariably be fatal. Even though the kitten is behaving normally now, you cannot be sure at this point that the kitten does not have rabies. If it is rabid, by the time it shows signs it may be too late for you to initiate effective post-exposure prophylaxis. Additionally, if you complete the vaccine series now and are ever bitten again, you will not have to undergo the immune globulin and entire vaccine series again. If you don't complete the vaccine series this time, you would have to start again with everything should you be bitten again. Not long ago I saw a case of a cat with rabies, and while we don't come across it often you have to be aware that it is out there.	2017-05-30 02:39:46Z	Harry Vervet	3

The typical incubation period for rabies runs 21 to 240 days. Hence, the usual legal 6-month (183 day) quarantine for possible rabies infections in any animals -- that duration is just beyond the peak of this incubation-range curve. A 6-month quarantine is still not safe, it's just "safer". Keep in mind too that giving a wild-harvested cat a rabies-shot does not cure it of rabies if it already has rabies -- nor are rabies-vaccines at all effective on the undeveloped immune systems of kittens. A cat or kitten may or may not show any symptoms of harboring rabies up to the point of its death. Not all animals exhibit the so-called "furious rabies" symptoms during the 2 weeks before death from rabies. 1 out of 5 (~20%) of all rabid animals only exhibit minor symptoms of lethargy, paralysis, or disorientation; called "dumb rabies" or "paralytic rabies".

There is not, as yet, a widely accepted legal definition of GMO. See the LA Times article   for more on this topic. All bananas you eat are genetically modified. Bananas do not grow in nature without seeds; we have engineered them that way for the consumer. It is impossible to say exactly what the nature of the genetic engineering that occurred in these bananas without asking the company directly, and they may not wish to divulge that information. They could have modified genes to ripen the bananas quicker, improve their vitamin content, make them more resisant to disease, preserve their shelf life, etc. There is little point on extensively discussing here whether genetically modified bananas are safe to eat, because there are people on both sides of that argument who will never agree, on principle.

12438	12739	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12739	I generally agree with  , although I would add a couple of provisos. a) The answer partly depends on how one defines 'spontaneous', an adjective with more than one meaning: Along the lines of what   wrote, if the thrilling chase caused the character to become sexually aroused, then his erection would not meet the first definition of 'spontaneous' because there was an external influence. On the other hand, one might argue that since Franco took Viagra, he   to achieve an erection at some point in the near future, which would satisfy the second definition of 'spontaneous', i.e., it was a voluntary act. Sure, that argument is a bit of a stretch, so let's move on to a more important point. b) Perhaps  , the OP  , is asking if Viagra can cause an   erection. If that is the case, then the answer is a qualified 'no'. I say 'qualified' because there are two uncommon exceptions: 1) About 2.5% of men   who take sildenafil (the generic name for Viagra) report experiencing priapism  , a condition made famous by the commercials for Viagra and similar medications that warn of "an erection that lasts for more than 4 hours."  In the cited journal article (see footnote  ) the authors note, "However, for most of the priapism cases, the reporter indicated that the case was not clinically severe. Also, for most of the priapism cases, the reporter indicated that the patient had recovered or was recovering without sequelae at the time of the report."  2) In another sildenafil research study   15% of the men reported "recovery of spontaneous erection" after taking the medicine for a limited period of time. (They subsequently stopped taking sildenafil and continued to enjoy normal erectile function.) In this instance, the authors are using 'spontaneous' in the sense of a 'natural process', which I recognize is not exactly what we're talking about here, but I wanted to mention it for completeness.

12390	12393	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12393	The biggest issue with using supplements instead of food is that studies don't always measure what they think they're measuring. A lot of near-magical powers were ascribed to Vitamin C, for example, that have not held up when done with supplements. It may turn out that many of the benefits of "Vitamin C" are really be related to fibre, since people were getting that Vitamin C from fruits and veg. Or to some other phytonutrient. Or to being the kind of person who spontaneously eats a lot of fruit and veg, or at least doesn't get kicked out for noncompliance when in a study that asks you to eat a lot of fruit and veg. : There was also the whole "oat bran fibre" thing that turned out to be mostly about what participants   eat because they were so full from eating three huge fibre-filled muffins every day. Choosing a sweetened breakfast cereal that happens to have a little oat fibre in it isn't going to have that effect. When there is an observation that "people who eat a lot of food X have less Y", reasoning about exactly the reason for it - a compound in food X, a compound in a thing people often eat with food X, a food they don't eat instead, a cultural habit -- is more of a challenge than you might think. To use a non-food example, studies about whether circumcision affects the spread of STDs was complicated by different rates of being piously religious and monogamous in the two groups. As a result, just taking a Vitamin C pill may not help you at all, if you're not generally eating good food. For the specific case of vegans,   seems to be in favour of supplements-in-disguise  by recommending fortified products a lot: They do include sources that are not supplements though, and these probably are still the wiser approach.

Yes, reflux causes actual chest pain in some people. Just because you can easily recognize it as reflux doesn't mean everyone can. What if you've felt reflux before, but the pain seems a bit different this time? Do you just wave it off and hope you're right? Esophageal spasms can be intensely painful, and if it's the first time you've felt it how would you know what it was?  But perhaps most importantly, the very notion of what cardiac chest pain "should" feel like is a dangerous generalization created by Hollywood and urban legend. Cardiac chest pain comes in a wide range of varieties, many of which can be mimicked by reflux, esophageal spasm, muscle strains, spinal problems, pleurisy, and a dozen other conditions. It can be sharp or dull; it can be more like a pressure than actual pain; it can radiate to one or more arms, the jaw, shoulders, or back. In fact, it might be felt somewhere other than the chest entirely, or there may be no pain at all. So-called silent heart attacks are not unusual, especially in diabetics, women and the elderly.  So, no, distinguishing cardiac chest pain from other sources is neither easy nor obvious. Walk into any ER (A&E) the world over complaining of chest pain, and they will work you up under the assumption that it is of cardiac origin until that possibility has been ruled out. Nobody ever died from misdiagnosed reflux, but they most certainly have died of misdiagnosed chest pain.	2017-05-22 18:03:05Z	Carey Gregory	1

12368	12371	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12371	Eating cholesterol is bad for the body, and  . Eating any kind of saturated fat is bad even unsaturated fats should only be used in small amounts. The only fats the body needs are the Omega-3 and Omega-6 essential fatty acids, but we only need a few grams per day of these. To understand the problems with eating cholesterol and (saturated) fats in general, it's helpful to get back to the basics. Our bodies have evolved for a very long time (tens of millions of years) as monkeys living in trees who got the vast majority of its energy in the form of sugars and starches from foods packed with useful nutrients. This has led to our bodies becoming dependent on a very high nutrient to calorie ratio. While our more recent ancestors did eat meat, indigenous populations who still live like our recent ancestors will typically get a far smaller fraction of their proteins from meat compared to us. They get the bulk of their essential amino acids from vegetables, but that requires eating vast amounts of vegetables and then you not only get the required amino acids but also vast amounts of other compounds. We may not require the amino acids from vegetables anymore because we eat more meat and dairy products, but if our bodies have evolved under the conditions where our bodies were flooded with all the compounds from the vast amounts of vegetables, then it's foregone conclusion that we're going to harm our bodies (perhaps in subtle ways) by eating less vegetables. Evidence that this picture is largely correct comes from studies done on indigenous populations,  . And   you can read about the results of an older study: The problem with cholesterol in the diet is then not just the cholesterol itself, but also with this indicating that you probably eat less vegetables and fruits than that cholesterol being all that harmful by itself (but note that even a little cholesterol in the diet does do some harm). People who eat more eggs and meat and use more cooking oils, will typically not eat large amounts of vegetables. There are compounds in vegetables like broccoli (e.g. lutein and zeaxanthin) that will prevent cholesterol from oxidizing, and it's the oxidized cholesterol that causes damage. If the cholesterol doesn't do the job it's supposed to do because it's getting oxidized, your body will produce more of it, leading to even more oxidized cholesterol and more damage to your arteries.	2017-05-20 22:15:01Z	Count Iblis	0

12320	12491	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12491	Is dental floss really effective?
The evidence shows that we don't know. Here the main issue is the lack of good evidence.  How we find how effective is? Simple: we took a group of people with similar age, similar dental status, and divide randomly to one group who will use floss and other who don't. Then, we wait for one, two or five years and compare caries and periodontal disease.  This is the theory.  In practice, there is   like this. All that we have are   tracking the oral health of people who floss and people who don't. Hence, sometimes we see that people who floss have better oral health that people who dont and sometimes the contrary. For example, if we ask @jess, we will record the he floss AND he have periodontal issues. The main issue with observational evidence is that, maybe, for some reason, the people who floss is essentially different from the people who don't. For example maybe the people who floss eat more vegetables and that is the reason why they have better oral health. Or, on the contrary, maybe the people who floss have more periodontal problems, and in such case we will find the opposite, that floss is correlated with periodontal disease.  Is hard to extract conclusions from observational evidence and that is the conclusion of most systematic reviews: we don't have evidence that indicate that floss is effective.   also we don't have evidence showing that floss is ineffective.  Hence, is wise to ask your dentist for your personal condition, taking in consideration all your particular characteristics and follow her/his advice.  More info: 	2017-06-01 15:30:51Z	sergiouribe	3

I've had periodontal disease for years and go to the dentist every 3 months also. A couple of years ago I purchased a shower water pick and quit flossing because I thought the water pick would do the job. After a year I developed my first periodontal infection. Hadn't had one ever before. The dentist  told me that I should have the tooth pulled because the infection may spread to the tooth next to the infected tooth. When the infection was cleared up with antibiotics I never had the tooth pulled as it felt fine to me. Well, 3 years later that back infected tooth became loose and had to be pulled. Then 4 months later the tooth next to the pulled tooth started hurting and with a dental CT scan (couldn't be seen with regular X Ray) they saw the bone that had been eaten away so now I have to have that tooth removed next Tuesday. Why oh why didn't I listen. You have to floss daily  -- the floss goes under the gums --- the water pick does not.

COX-1 helps protect the stomach and intestinal lining from the acids the stomach produces  . Since NSAIDs inhibit the production of these enzymes, they also leave your stomach and intestinal lining somewhat unprotected from acids. This is what can cause damage from long-term use of NSAIDs. It's not so much that they burn a hole in your stomach, but that they reduce the protection offered by the COX-1 enzyme. Of course, the higher the dose, the greater the effect on these enzymes, and the longer NSAIDs are taken, the greater the gastrointestinal risk. Except for low-dose aspirin, NSAIDs should not be taken longer than necessary. __________ 1. 	2018-01-16 01:43:57Z	BillDOe	4

The situation "almost impossible," as you describe it, can also be possible if certain conditions were achieved.  Getting pregnant is actually not something easy, even though you can find a lot of crazy discussions on women getting pregnant from trees, bullets, air, oral and anal sex, etc. It's a whole crazy world out there.  The fertility of the egg is decreasing significantly after the ovulation, so according to your time-frame, she should be okay (see graph). 
 As you see, the danger would have been before the ovulation or during the ovulation. In your case, there are two days after the ovulation (if the app calculations are correct). Fertility also depends on her age. The older a person gets, the lower the fertility, so also consider that.  I would say that you should use science and ask her to make a pregnancy test. That instrument should give you a better "opinion" than mine. Also, if she is really scared about it, there are the so-called "morning after pills" which are quite efficient in terminating an eventual fertilization. She can get one next time you are in similar situation, rather than stressing out. However, NEVER use those pills as a contraceptive method. Use it ONLY for emergency purpose.

The study, however, is only a 10-week study.  shows that one dose of sucralose does not cause insulin production.  tends to show that ongoing use of artificial sweeteners does not control weight, but it is not conclusive evidence that it causes an increase in weight (self-selection issue). , however, discusses a cohort where higher consumption of diet soda is associated with a significant increase of the risk of metabolic syndrome and the development of T2 diabetes. It is not, however, a smoking gun, because it does not prove causality but association (there could be self-selection: people at risk for metabolic syndrome may tend to drink more diet soda). I would say that there is weak evidence of an association between the consumption of artificial sweeteners and diabetes risk. There is also some evidence that using artificial sweeteners is better than SSBs. On the whole, it seems to me that evidence is mixed at this stage.  For myself, I will continue -- carefully -- to use artificial sweeteners (sucralose in my case), but I will keep an eye on additional evidence when it comes up. 1: Malik, Vasanti S., and Frank B. Hu.

12298	12302	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12302	Ferritin levels of 21 ug/L are on the extreme lower edge of the normal range. You can think about iron stores as follows. A healthy person will have iron stores of a few grams. Since iron is present in every cell of the body, we lose iron via the loss of dead skin cells, mucus, sweat etc. etc. The iron in red blood cells is recycled when they die, so we don't lose that iron. But you can lose iron due to bleeding, e.g. intestinal bleeding can go unnoticed and only cause low iron levels. Women who get heavy menstrual bleeding can also end up with low iron levels. The typical loss of iron in healthy persons is about 1 milligram per day, this means that we absorb about 1 milligram of iron from food. The typical diet contains 10 to 20 milligrams of iron, our bodies are capable of absorbing quite a bit more than the 1 milligram and will typically be able to do that when iron stores get low unless, of course, the cause of the iron deficiency is due to poor iron absorption or a poor diet. Iron supplements prescribed by a doctor typically contain about 100 milligrams of iron. You'll be able to absorb anywhere between 20% and 50% of this, so it will take at least a month before you've put back 2 grams of iron into your body. Without such supplements, with a good diet this would take ten times longer, so at least a year or so (assuming that the dietary fix is actually going to do the job). Since you are young person (you're not an old, frail, 90 year old) you have to consider the cause of the iron deficiency even if it isn't due to serious medical problems. If it's due to a poor diet (as opposed to heavy menstrual bleeding), then your diet must be so poor that it's likely affecting your health in other ways besides causing low iron levels. If you were 90 years old then it would be far more reasonable that a normal diet could fall short of the iron requirement. 	2017-05-13 22:00:26Z	Count Iblis	1
12294	12329	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12329	Part of why some people get out of breath faster is due to an inefficiency in the lungs and in the muscles.  Muscles use oxygen when they move, the more they move the more oxygen they use.  However, muscles are able to adapt and become more efficient in someone who is consistently active.  Also, the lungs are powered by intercostal muscles, which are a bunch of small muscles, and the diaphragm.  Someone who is fit usually takes deep breaths to account for the increase in Oxygen needed for physical activity, and do this consistently with their exercise routine. Their diaphragm and other lung muscles get stronger with the regular deep breaths taken, making their lungs work more efficiently as well.	2017-05-17 09:20:50Z	Virginia	1

12276	12536	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12536	Triceba is actually Tresiba. It is a very long-acting basal insulin, that you take once a day. It is probably the best basal insulin today for people who do not have fast-changing basal needs like athletes: very insensitive to when you are taking it.  Toujeo is a 3x concentrated version of insulin glargine -- i.e. 3x Lantus. It acts roughly like Lantus, but its increased concentration gives it slightly different properties in terms of timing. The most interesting aspect of Toujeo is that it does not appear to wane "too early" as Lantus often does with many users (Lantus can wane sometimes in as little as 18 or 20 hours for some individuals).   shows more sustaining power for Toujeo vs Lantus. Both Tresiba and Toujeo are modern insulins that are superior in some ways to the old ones. One can be better than the other depending upon your need: If you have a waning problem with Toujeo (rare but not impossible), approach your doctor and ask him for a letter of medical necessity, to explain to your insurance that the only insulin you can use really is Tresiba. But there is a good chance that Toujeo may actually work well for you, and even be the superior insulin if you are somewhat insulin-resistant. Good luck!	2017-06-06 03:05:02Z	WestOfPecos	3

There used to be one more, the Abbott Navigator, but it was withdrawn from the US market about 4 years ago. The Medtronic Enlite had a very rough start, with many complaints and worries about accuracy, but seems to have stabilized. The Dexcom G4 and G5 are strong and mature systems. The Enlite requires 3-4 calibrations per day. It can be a bit picky about how to redo a missed calibration. There are no communities of users that I know of where you can find great calibration recipes for the Enlite. The Dexcom G4 and G5 require 2-3 calibrations per day. Users have come up with fairly sophisticated routines to optimize them and ensure that the actual reading is close to reality -- a good forum to discuss that may be   . I can provide no proof for that, but I consider that almost all the calibration recipes you get there for the G4 and G5 would work for the Enlite as well - very little is specific to the Dexcom CGMs. The Freestyle Libre Pro is not a consumer CGM. Its function is really different:  your doctor gives you the sensor, you wear it for 2 weeks without knowing what it measures, then your doctor downloads the results. It is a diagnostic tool, not a diabetes management tool. However, there is another Freestyle available that you may be aware of, the Freestyle Libre. The Freestyle Libre is actually a pretty cool idea, although not quite a consumer CGM either. Essentially, it is a sensor without a transmitter -- and, like the Freestyle Libre Pro, it dos not need calibration either! You need to manually pass a reader over it to read the result. So you can get a result anytime you want, but you do not get a track that you can view like you do with a Dexcom. The difference may seem small but is actually a giant one when trying to manage blood glucose. Nonetheless, the Freestyle Libre, with its much lower cost, is a great tool that fulfills a different need.  Unfortunately, the Freestyle Libre is not available in the US yet. So, in the end -- there is no CGM that I know of which is present in the US but does not require calibration. If I had to pick: Good luck!	2017-06-06 03:42:08Z	WestOfPecos	1

Most carby snacks have no way to make the salt stick without the fat. Air popped popcorn, for example, the salt just falls off.  Ditto microwave or oven crisps. You can reduce the fat and change the fat and that may help. For example oven-baked potato wedges with just a little oil. Air popped popcorn with a tiny drizzle of butter. They sell low fat crackers that are salty but apparently they are high in sugar. You'll have better luck going the protein route. For those who eat meat, lean meat most certainly exists. I make my own jerky, which is very salty and satisfying. There are also low- and no-fat sliced meats (chicken, turkey, ham) though these need to be kept cool and can't just be pulled out of your pocket for a nibble on the bus. I have seen dried sausages, pepperoni-style, in a snack size and a low-fat variant. If you have the ability to prepare a little, a salt-lover in my family loves to dip spring onions (green onions - the long thin things that are white at one end and green at the other) in salt a bite at a time.  If you have a home dehydrator, try beet chips: slice beet(root) very thin, lay out on dehydrator trays, sprinkle a pinch of sea salt on each (the juices will make it stick / soak in) and then dry them.

HIV is notoriously stealthy, often producing no symptoms for months or even years, and in the meantime the person can transmit the disease. That scenario describes a large percentage of the people who have transmitted the disease.  Then there are the people who don't even know it exists, much less how to prevent it. A lot of the world isn't educated and doesn't have access to modern health care.  Intercourse isn't the only way to transmit it. Sharing needles is a common route of infection among drug addicts, and in third world countries where medical supplies are scarce, needles are sometimes reused. Infections have also occurred via organ donations, accidental exposure to body fluids (usually medical personnel), and from mother to child both in vitro and via breast milk.  Thousands of people died of AIDS due to HIV infections they acquired from blood transfusions and organ donations before HIV was recognized and screened for. That probably still happens in third world countries where they don't have the money or facilities to screen adequately. And of course, there are the sociopaths who just don't care. There are people who know they are HIV+ and will still go out and have unprotected sex without informing their partners.  And finally, you might want to consult a few religions about convincing people not to have sex. Several of them have been trying to do that for thousands of years and every one of them has failed miserably. So it's a nice idea, but it would take a large coordinated effort by most countries around the world (lasting many years and costing many billions) to eradicate it entirely.

The reason why infusion sets cannot stay as long as CGM sensors is that the cannula used for injecting insulin in an infusion set is a lot more invasive and damaging than the very thin fiber that is used for measurement in a CGM sensor. CGM users often make their sensors last much longer than the manufacturer's requirements: the Dexcom sensor is supposed to stay on 7 days, but many users use them for 14 days, sometimes much more. In fact, there are   as to who can keep them longest... On the other hand, I don't know of pump users who commonly use their infusion sites for longer -- I am sure they exist, but it is simply not a common thing. I do hear a lot of users complaining that they cannot keep their site going for three days -- and many users also report that their third-day site absorption is worse than the other two days (a commonly mentioned factor is 20% worse). Infusion sets are a costly part of the system for pump users, so I would expect to have heard about a lot of users reporting on forums how successful they are at making them last very long -- but that's not the case. So, imho, existing cannula technology is unlikely to allow for an infusion site lasting beyond 3-4 days. It will take some radical innovation, I think, to make it possible.   [EDIT] Per the discussion in the comments section, to reply to the need for more precision in this answer by the OP, I actually   to summarize their exposure to leaving infusion sets for a longer duration. The anecdotal results were that, while a small number of people are able to leave infusion sets longer than 3 days, a fairly significant number of posters reported problems on day 3 or later, as well as potential long-term damage to the site (lipodystrophy). When going user-per-user to compare their report to their pump brand using their previous posts, results appear similar across tubeless and tubed pumps.	2017-06-06 17:05:31Z	WestOfPecos	1

By its very nature, inhaled insulin has inherent advantages for speed of action, from the lungs into the bloodstream.

Not that I could sit down and read it, I used it more as a topic reference, but I did have classmates who read the thing, kudos to them.   I loved   for a more straightforward, simplified, top-down approach to pathology. It solidifies fundamentals without too many details, which Robbins and other sources will certainly fill in for you. The most comprehensive sources of advanced concepts are usually system-specific texts rather than a general pathology textbook.  For example, extremely advanced cardiac pathophysiology would be more extensively covered in cardiology-specific literature than in Robbins. Note: This answer is opinion-based.

In general, for a dental procedure, the major potential complications that are directly related to diabetes include infection and slow healing, but others are possible. There are several risk stratification assessments that are used to determine the level of risk someone has going into different types of procedures.  So it is impossible for anyone online to counsel you on your own risks and benefits. You should go ASAP for evaluation of what it is.  It could be a cavity that may or may not require a root canal, or it could be an abscess developing.

Only he/she can explain the significance of the results, and what that means for your dad. I assume you are asking this because you read that and were worried, so you tried to google it but found the results confusing. I can help clarify the individual words in your question and help guide your understanding, so that you are prepared for your conversation with his doctor.   This is NOT an explanation of the CT results. Only the doctor can do that for you. Note that there are limitations to what a CT scan can tell you for certain.  A CT is not a perfect photograph, nor a tissue sample that you can say for certain is X Y or Z.  A radiologist analyzes the characteristics of abnormalities that he/she sees and makes recommendations of what it is - sometimes it is straightforward like a clear fracture in a bone, other times less clear like a shadow on a bone.  Again, you need the doctor to combine the CT results with everything else known about your father in order to say what he thinks is going on. Definitions: Usually in human anatomy, pedicle will indicate the portion of the vertebrae (of the spinal column) that form the sides of the hole through which the spinal cord passes (see below in pink) In surgical anatomy, there seems to be a neurovascular bundle referred to as the "prostatic pedicle." The radiologist may be suggesting that it appears to be a metastasis on the spine.  But a CT scan can only suggest that something is a metastasis, it can't diagnose it for certain - that is why you need to see his doctor, who can interpret it along with your dad's clinical picture and tell you what it means.	2017-04-30 09:44:17Z	DoctorWhom	1
12122	12232	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12232	When the rabies virus is spread to a new host, it first attacks muscle cells, which prevents the host's immune system from recognizing the invasion. Next, it binds to neurons at neuromuscular junction. Rabies virus is neurotropic, thus it binds preferentially to neurons, specifically the acetylcholine receptors on neurons. After binding the neuromuscular junction, it uses retrograde transport to travel up the neuron axon. When the virus reaches the neuron cell body, it rapidly spreads to the central nervous system, where it replicates in motor neurons and quickly reaches the brain. Next, it travels to the peripheral and autonomic nervous system and then finally reaches the salivary glands. So, why does the rabies virus cause hydrophobia? The virus is accumulated in the salivary glands of the host so that it can be transmitted to the next host, often through wounds inflicted by a bite. As the virus spreads through bites, drinking water or swallowing would decrease transmission (by reducing quantities of infected saliva present in the mouth). To prevent this, the rabies virus causes painful spasms in throat and larynx. This causes saliva production in the host to be greatly increased, and also means that drinking, or even thinking about drinking, causes painful spasms in the throat. Since the muscular movements that occur while drinking are involuntary, and the virus has already infected autonomic nervous system and motor neurons, this is what enables it to control the involuntary muscle movements of throat and larynx in the host. This association of swallowing with the excruciating pain, and an inability to swallow, leading to choking, is what leads to fear of water. Thus the term 'hydrophobia' in this case is somewhat misleading - bathing or a body of water might wouldn't trigger a hydrophobic response (unless ingestion of water was a possibility), as the fear is more specifically fear of choking on liquids due to impaired swallowing. 	2017-05-07 18:09:45Z	Jon Letko	2

Sometimes ovulation tests appear positive in pregnancy because LH is very structurally similar to a alpha-HCG, a subunit of HCG that is being secreted in pregnancy - and so ovulation tests also pick it up. However, a pregnancy test is more sensitive to HCG than an ovulation test, so a negative result on it is probably indicative of no pregnancy. You could however test again in 3-4 days to make sure. LH values can vary a bit during the cycle and have 'peaks' even when you're not ovulating.	2017-05-05 20:05:45Z	user9119	0

12103	12105	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12105	The number you are looking for is basically the energy the body needs in a resting state. 
When resting, we assume that no energy is used for any actions but vital ones, as the body is not exactly doing anything. Measuring that energy is slightly more complicated. Here is my solution to it: 
With any machine, we are talking about efficiency. This is basically the percentage of energy that is actually used and not turned into heat.    The efficiency of the human respiratory system (the ATP cycle) is  . This means that 61% of the energy is transferred as body heat and 39% are actually being used. 
(The maximum practical efficiency of combustion engines is  , just for comparison.) The energy of our body heat is approximately  . Because 61% of the total energy vital for our body is the body heat, the 80 Watt are 61% of the total energy necessary.  Therefore, the total energy needed for the body is 130 watt or 130 Joule / second. This energy is the same as 468kJ per hour or 11MJ per day. Converting this into kcal results in 2629kcal.  This is roughly 200kcal more than   lists as requirements for a sedentary average male.
Why could this be the case? It is probably because the body heat energy is difficult to measure and prone for errors. If it was 60 watt instead, we would end up with 2000kcal / day, which seems a bit more realistic to me.  : According to Jason's answer, my end result should be around 1200kcal / day. This leaves me wondering what has messed up my calculations... I couldn't find a link to an online version of the source that Wikipedia cites. There seems no other reliable reference out there that has a number. This is why I cited wikipedia.	2017-04-27 19:59:38Z	Narusan-in-coma	3

Anyway I want to the doctor after a couple weeks to determine if any bones were broken, there wasn't and I was told that the X-ray didn't show any sign of tear. But then I was hand examined and I had a swollen part of my knee that indicated that I tore my meniscus. Doctor said if you don't feel better in two weeks come back(to have surgery 😑). (Ok this anwser is taking too long).  Anyway the accident happened in January and my knee still hurts.(after I started exercising it started to feel better. I have read that exercising(not to harsh obviously) that will actually help. This will cause the muscle to grow around my knee and strengthen it.  That will do the same with your wrist. Every part of the human body is able to repair itself.  Babies can regrow  finger tips(part of their finger) for crying out loud.  Now the speed of your recovery depends on the listed items below.

Next you should slowly exercise your wrist. Look the exercises up.
Don't over do it. Get alot of sleep and eat correctly. Healing will be quicker. A torn ligament takes 6-9 months to heal.
Make sure, when you sitting at a desk, to not lay your wrist on the border of the desk this will put a sharp pressure on your wrist causing it to hurt.

So no, neither one can continue to function without the other. As for CPR, I don't see how anything would change. Without circulating blood in the lungs, no gas exchange can occur, and that's the one thing lungs do. As for the the heart, without oxygen being delivered by the lungs the heart would stop quickly. (But that's okay because the brain would already be dead at that point.) So no, the two are completely inter-dependent and cannot function independently. 	2017-04-26 04:17:21Z	Carey Gregory	4
12073	12075	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12075	The above answer is correct: no they can't function independently. I want to build on that answer with a couple additional points. Consider that your heart beats while you hold your breath - but it needs oxygen, so if your lungs stop for a long time they aren't exchanging O   and CO  so your heart muscle will eventually stop.  Conversely if your heart stops, you're on your way to dying and your neurological breathing mechanisms will eventually stop, as will the muscles that move air in/out.   So again as the above answer discusses, fundamentally, if one stops the other will soon stop too. Then soon thereafter the rest of the body too, i.e. death. Neither organ could last very long on its own without mechanical support to get it going again. For the question the answer is that if blood stops circulating, your lungs will soon stop moving air in/out - but even then there IS  , even if neither is moving.  But that doesn't do any good for the person, who is basically dying, unless the blood starts circulating again - by CPR or a machine or on its own.   CPR circulates blood primarily, but also pressing on the chest moves a little bit of air in/out of the lungs.  That is why  . "Hands only CPR."  Compressions are precious in circulating blood to the brain, and seconds of them are lost when doing breathing.  EMTs and Paramedics outside the hospital are a different story, as they are skilled medical professionals, and might use a bag device to help breathing. It is that principle of equalization of O  and CO  between blood and air that makes the tiny bit of air that goes in/out of the lungs during chest compressions good enough to not lose precious compressions.	2017-04-26 07:21:53Z	Mesentery	4

Nevertheless, HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) survives for short periods of time outside the host (1). It can survive on dry inanimate surfaces, with a survival ranges from a few hours to 8 weeks (2). The use of disinfectants could certainly help diminish the risk of contagiousness. It can be inactivated by 0.5% Lysol[benzalkonium chloride] in 5 minutes, by 2,000 ppm (2,000 ul/liter) of bleach in 10 minutes, or by rubbing alcohol (1:1 mixtures) (3, 4, 5). To conclude, prophylactic use of oral acyclovir could be, in extreme cases, an option to reduce risk of communication (6). References: Ref 1-3 from 	2017-04-24 21:26:36Z	Jack Frost	1

While liver is a   good source of vitamin D, it's also   high in vitamin A. A person eating liver  more often than once or twice a week could possibly overload on vitamin A. Especially in the amount youd need to correct a vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin A is toxic in larger amounts. Just one serving of 100 grams of beef liver contains 26,000 IU of vitamin A. 100 grams is roughly the size of a woman's palm. The US Institute of Medicine gives an upper limit of 3,000 IU of vitamin A per day. Vitamin D content in beef liver, however, is only 49 IU. The USDA Nutrient Database doesn't even list vitamin D in chicken or lamb liver. Why not take vitamin D tablets? They're available as D3 (cholecalciferol) and it's converted to calcitriol, the active metabolive used in the body. It's inexpensive and the dose can be better controlled than by eating liver. Your doctor would be best suggesting how much D to take. 	2017-04-23 10:52:03Z	Jude	2

A catheter needle is placed into a blood vessel and a wire, other catheters and other needed devices are threaded through the small hole. It's used in balloon angioplasty, stent placement, cardiac ablation and positioning or replacing lead wires for heart pumps.
It always involves going through a blood vessel. Laparoscopic surgery is considered minimally invasive and involves a surgeon making a small incision in the skin, between 0.5 to 1.5 cm (0.2 to 0.6 inches), further away from the steam to be operated on and using specialized equipment to both light up the internal area worked on and to view the area through a camera linked to an external screen that the surgeon views. Specialized surgical instruments are needed too for the surgeon to reach and manipulate tissue that's at a distance from the small incision.  So basically one is done through a small hole while the other is done through a small incision, although considerably larger than a hole.

Olives and avocados have more calories but are still nutrient dense with healthy fats. Calorie-dense foods include things that have many calories (and often fat) in small amounts of the food, proportionally high in comparison with less nutrition - like mayonnaise, fried foods, sugar, flour/bread, etc. Examples: Many cheeses and some meats (like salami or tuna with mayo) have more calories and fat per gram of protein and are therefore less nutrient-dense than lean meats (like chicken or turkey breast).

This answer discusses the difference between the professions and licensing in general.  State licensing boards may publish state-specific laws. The term   who goes through medical school and does a pathology residency (after-graduation training that nearly all physicians do).  There are different divisions within pathology that some pathologists can specialize in. Pathologists in general are specialists in the analysis of anatomical structures and histology (tissues and cells) and all the things that could go wrong with them - diseases, disorders, injuries, and other destructive processes.  A pathologist in a hospital may, for example, receive biopsies to check for cancer, blood smears to look for abnormalities, autopsies, forensics, etc.  They have a broad base of skills and knowledge that can be valuable in many applications.   Like any other kind of physician, they can choose to do things other than practice in clinical settings - they may do research or product design or advising or policy...etc.   as: The possible types of endeavors in biotechnology are very diverse, but overall differ from pathology in most forms of practice, although their paths may cross. A pathologist might be able to engage in biotechnology, whereas a biotechnologist could not practice as a medical pathologist without going to medical school.  But an MD/DO is not the only route into the   of pathology - there are pathology technicians that assist pathologists, there are PhDs in pathology that do research similar to the research pathologists might do, and other related professions. It seems that the general field of biotechnology can be entered in different paths, but there are actual   that are PhD level training.	2017-04-25 05:56:07Z	DoctorWhom	1

12010	12080	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12080	This is a complicated question, as there are likely few people (I am not one of them) who are fully knowledgeable in the scope of both DVM and MD or DO (which is the other type of physician degree) in combination with PhD, and I do not know if someone with that knowledge will see this question.  But your question is a very good question - I would recommend you seek out and ask MD PhDs, DVM PhDs, MDs, and PhDs to explore your options.  It's an important decision.   I can help from the perspective of an MD/MPH (Masters in Public Health) who has done some research, and I have colleagues who do many different types of research with varying combinations of degrees. MD or DO alone, MD or DO + PhD, or just PhD (e.g. in fields like biomedical engineering). There are a number of MD-PhD or DO-PhD combined programs where usually you do 2 years of med school, then complete the PhD (which often is 4 but can be much more), then return for the last 2 years of medical school - and may or may not go on to complete residency.  Some MD/DO PhDs practice clinical medicine, whether they do research or not.  I imagine this is much the same for DVM-PhD programs. But more to the point, what is most important is for you to reflect on your ultimate goals.  Are you specifically interested in working on animal models?  Or do you want to obtain the education that provides you the most possible options, so that you can determine along the way where you feel you can make the greatest impact? There are vast numbers of ways to engage in research that improves the health of humans, and animal models is only a subset of the diverse possibilities.   The potential advantages of DVM over an MD/DO is something I had not previously considered, and I can see how expertise in the animal models would be beneficial in some research.  But again, are you sure you want to focus primarily on animal models?  Consider that DVM may limit your scope of what you can do in clinical research involving human subjects.   The other paths include MD or DO alone, MD PhD, DO PhD, PhD alone (in fields like Biomedical Engineering etc), PharmD (pharmacy doctorate), or others. Of the two you mentioned, the MD-PhD (or PhD alone) may open more doors for you in research overall, since animal research is only one section of medical research.  The MD/DO when combined with PhD does give advantages over PhD alone in some circumstances, from what I understand, but is not always necessary. What an MD/DO can give you is a thorough grounding in both the fundamentals of human physiology/pathophysiology AND its clinical management.  Completing a residency in clinical medicine also gives you the experience and skills to actually   medicine in addition to doing research. Again, I recommend talking with people with the degrees and combinations I mentioned.  Your school's advising counselors should be able to help arrange that, or contact a local university with a med school or phd program to request to speak with their advisors, or with researchers.  They may help you as a prospective student. As a parting thought, you might also consider public health if you are aiming to do what you say here: Public health is sometimes overlooked, since people don't necessarily know about it as a field - but they definitely know the effects of it.  Public health is all about improving the health of entire populations through multiple angles, including many branches of research.  It incorporates (and offers specializations in) epidemiology, biostatistics, disease prevention, education, program design and analysis, population management, policy and administration, and other elements.  Vaccinating the population has been a joint effort of medical research and public health.  Read about public health and maybe talk with the department at a university - it's actually a really rich and diverse field with lots of opportunities.  	2017-04-26 10:38:44Z	DoctorWhom	3
12010	15016	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15016	A PhD is a research degree, so you should get a PhD if you want research-focused training. MD and DVM are clinical degrees - they do not specifically train you how to do research. I think one great reason to choose MD is if you would prefer to treat human patients; likewise, if you'd prefer to treat animal patients, you should get a DVM. If you just want to do medically-relevant research, your question should be, Do I want to focus on human medicine or animal medicine? There are a TON of MD/PhDs, MDs, and PhDs who work with animal models doing human-relevant research. (And, obviously, DVM/PhDs and DVMs who work with animal models doing human-relevant or animal-relevant research.) I would suggest that if your primary goal is to understand human disease, you should get an MD PhD. If your primary goal is to work with animal models to understand animal disease, you should get a DVM PhD.

Additionally,   allows you to input the name of an ingredient and returns the comedogenicity and irritancy ratings. I haven't used it extensively, but it has matched up with the Fulton scale on each search I've done so far.
However, comedogenicity ratings are definitely not to be taken as gospel. Acne is highly individual and multifactorial, so there is no way to derive a universally accurate scale of ingredients that will or will not cause acne. It can certainly be a helpful tool, but if it were that simple, no one would have long-term acne! ;) Moisturizer can also cause skin issues via sensitivity or allergy to any of the ingredients. I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to just about everything, so that happens to me all the time and I've just thrown in the towel and started making my own moisturizer.

People who seem Naturally good at remembering what they did during they day probably rethink their day over and over without conscious effort.     The reason for this is that your brain will capture / allocate resources to  what you focus your attention on and over time it gets better at it.

The fluoride, when ingested, has exactly the same effect, but reaches the oral enviroment via saliva. Is a [myth] ( ) that a tooth of a children raised in a zone with F in the water is more resistant. In fact, all epidemiological evidence shows that when a city stops the F in drinking water, the incidence of caries increase to similar levels that a comparable city whithout F in the drinking water. Hence,  . Via drinking water, the F is excreted in the saliva in a concentration of 0.019ppm, enough to create such CaF(2) deposits. Also,  . Communities with fluoride in drinking water have less adult caries prevalence and severity than communities without F.( )  After ingestion, F is absorbed mostly in the stomach, some in the small intestine and the rest is excreted in the feces. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in 20-60 min after ingestion. The decline occurs because uptake in calcified tissues and excretion in urine. 60% of ingested F is processed in the kidneys and excreted in the urine with a clearance of ~35ml/min in normal adults.  The metabolism rate is affected by many factors, as circadian rythm, diet, physical activity, altitude of residence, hormones, renal function, acid-base disturbances among others. See Buzalaf and Whitford for more details in the reference # ( ). Since F is the most electronegative element, binds with anything, but this can create some cosmetic issues in the developing teeth. When the teeth are formingm there is a delicate interaction between enamel matrix proteins (EMP) that form a matrix to deposit minerals for the enamel and proteases that retires EMP. Those proteases requires free Ca(2+) for normal function. Since the F is so promiscuos, it binds with free Ca(2+), interferring with the funtion of some proteases, hence interferring with the formation of enamel. See Aoba 2002 for the details in the reference # ( ). Those deficiencies in the enamel formation are known as fluorosis.  . The action of those proteases is only during the amelogenesis of permanent teeth, i.e 0 to 6 years-old.

11884	11896	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11896	Radiation (especially in fetuses/children) increases the likelihood of cancer. Our information comes mostly from atomic bomb survivors, people exposed at Chernobyl, people treated with high doses of radiation for cancer and other conditions, and people exposed to high levels of background radiation, e.g. uranium miners.  Can one CT scan increase your chance of developing cancer? Yes, but how   that is remains debatable. It depends on a lot of unmeasurable things: genetics, age, one's ability to repair the damage, which area of the body is being dosed, whether there are other carcinogens at work (e.g. viruses or co-carcinogens), etc. The following are commonly found numbers. Given 10,000 people, about 2000 will die of non-radiation related cancers. If you expose those 10,000 people to  , you can expect 5-6 additional cancer deaths in that 10,000 (or .5% increase).   However, if you expose someone to 10 mSv twice, with two months in between, the risk does not double.     Because of our ability to repair damaged DNA over time, it's generally estimated that, from natural background radiation, the risk of developing cancer from background radiation is about 1% of our total cancer risk.  (that's a high estimate. The newer the machine, the lower the dose - usually.) What is your chance of getting a   from that? The answer is: no one knows. Relative risk has be calculated by some. The following all give you a (estimated) 1 in a million chance of dying from that event : So, you can estimate that (maybe) the risk of dying from a 7 mSv CT scan is about equivalent to driving 2800 miles. The point of all this is, no one knows your exact risk of developing a lethal or r  cancer (yes, that does exist) from an imaging study. Most ethical radiologists will tell you there is no known safe radiation exposure, and that one should avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. While some imaging studies   unnecessary, some of them are not, and the risk of avoiding the study greatly outweighs the risk of undergoing it. What you can do to protect yourself:

11884	11900	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11900	The risk from a single CT exposure should realistically be estimated to be zero. 
The commonly used "linear no-threshold extrapolation model" to get to estimates of cancer risks due to exposure to low levels of radiation (of the order of 10 mSv or less) has  .  E.g., observations of excess cancer cases after the Chernobyl disaster have failed to find any evidence in favor of it: However, the model is still useful to get to very rigorous safety standards for people who can be exposed to radiation. It's of course better to exaggerate the risk by a factor of a thousand than to underestimate it by even a small factor. Also, the risk is not the same for patients and medical staff, a patient may be exposed only a few times in his/her life whole the medical staff could be exposed several times a day if they would not leave the room where the patient is scanned. The faults in the DNA that lead to cancer are overwhelmingly the result of  , not due to exposure to background radiation of few mSv to a few dozen mSv per year, so we don't need to worry about getting CT scans. We should worry about what we eat, whether we get enough exercise, and we should avoid stress (so, actually, we shouldn't worry too much), as these factors do impact on biological processes that are related to cancer risks. Here we need to consider that random DNA damage is not going to cause cancer, it has to be very specific damage affecting certain genes in crucial places. Also, the immune system which can then still eliminate the threat, has to fail to do so. If you stick to a healthy lifestyle, you're going to reduce most of these independent risk factors. 	2017-04-12 02:17:46Z	Count Iblis	1

Many people have heard of biodegradable materials in bone repair and often think it can be easily used as  . (I'm not implying that's what you think though it might be.) There's ongoing research into this field with better materials being developed and tested in animal models. The different kinds of suitable biodegradable material you ask about isn't used to   bone but instead they're used as a  . After bone formation has taken place, the material gradually degrades until only the bone manufactured by the person's body remains. Different materials need to be used depending where the bone repair is needed in the body. You ask about lengthening the limbs (you mentioned a leg in your comments). Biodegradable platform used in bone repair for a leg could be repair of a badly fractured bone where inserting titanium pins wouldn't work with too many shattered fragments. A biodegradable platform would be used that would allow bone to reform after the badly broken pieces are removed. No   piece of bone is used and meant to stay in. The material used needs to be strong enough to be load-bearing but porous enough to allow to allow orthoblasts, bone growth factors, fibroblasts, collagen and tiny capillaries to infiltrate the platform and form solid bone again. I won't go into detail of what particular materials are best or how it actually happens. Suffice to say, this is major surgery and the leg has to be opened up (if not already due to an open fracture. Repair will start quickly but for the newly formed bone to be strong enough for active use, it will take many months. The surrounding tissue of muscles, ligaments, tendons, blood vessels and nerves are largely intact, although damaged to an extent. They're available to provide the necessary cells and other factors that enable new bone formation. But what you're asking is for the leg to be opened, the bone to be cut through and a piece of   to be inserted. So where will the extra muscles, nerves and blood vessels come from?

The key point to remember is: correlation does not imply causation.  That means that just because two things appear to coincide, you can't conclude that one causes the other - or even that they are related at all. This is a  .  They are looking at these variables at a single point in time.  This kind of study allows you to say "interesting, many people who own red cars have cats." Correlation.

Of these designs, the   design is generally the strongest for that purpose - but that is a discussion in and of itself. This is a   that I share to emphasize the key message to take from this - just because the prevalence or incidence of two variables coincides, you can't say anything about whether there is causation or relationship at all. To answer your question, in review of the study, there is absolutely no evidence to support that one causes the other, or that they are in any way related.

11777	13202	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13202	Arguments that suggest that there exists a rather trivial vulnerability in the human body that would be relevant even if you stick to a healthy lifestyle, should a priori be considered to be unlikely. Animals have survived for hundreds of millions of years in the wild without needing to consult expert dietitians to make sure calcium absorption is not impaired. Now, there is actually some hard evidence that this particular argument is bunk. As  : The core mistake made when such arguments are presented, is that the human body is pictured like a simple machine (e.g. a car) that is subject to wear and tear and then one argues that when subject to certain conditions, the body will degenerate. But the human body is not like a simple machine that we can make, it's a machine that is constantly maintaining itself. Your bones are living tissue that are constantly breaking down and are being rebuild. They should not be compared to a concrete wall of a building, it's far more appropriate to compare it to a building site where a lot of building work is constantly going on. When the system is perturbed, e.g. due to changes in the diet, less calcium is being absorbed, many feedback mechanisms at many different levels start to act to prevent this perturbation from causing problems. E.g. lower calcium levels in the blood will cause the kidneys to remove phosphate from the blood. The phosphate in the blood is in  chemical equilibrium with the phosphate bound to the bones, if phosphate is removed then the blood gets undersaturated with phosphate and phosphate from the bones is released onto the blood which then also releases calcium from the bones into the blood. At the same time the kidneys release calcitriol in the blood which ends up in the cells of the intestines, there they switch on a gene that codes for an enzyme that increases the calcium absorption from food. This is just one of the many layers of feedback systems that regulate calcium metabolism. To get into trouble you have perturb the system so much that the feedback mechanism can no longer compensate for that, e.g. if you get way to little calcium from your diet. Or if your vitamin D levels are much too low then the body cannot make cacitriol, which is derived from vitamin D. Now, in the flawed reasoning where you picture the human body as a simple system like a building, there are no feedback mechanisms. A wall of a building does not repair itself. The human body, in contrast, does repair itself but not perfectly, otherwise we would live forever. What we can do is make the self-repair mechanisms more effective, or at least make sure they don't degrade very fast as we age. An unhealthy diet that causes arteriosclerosis is not just bad for the heart, arteries throughout the body will be clogged. This will make the transport of nutrients to all cells in your body to get impaired, including those in your bones, and that then compromises the self-repair capacity. This is why eating broccoli is better for your bones than eating a cheeseburger.  Exercise will cause the self-repair mechanisms to be boosted to keep up with the increased need for repairs and as explained above, the more active the self-repair mechanisms are the better your body including your bones will be maintained. 	2017-08-02 20:08:02Z	Count Iblis	1

That being said, some general points about pathology reports and some of the nuances may be illuminating for you or others. Rather than thinking in a binary way about results: pathologists can't always be certain- sometimes it's clearly malignant, sometimes it isn't. Margins, are  , are by definition not available in a punch biopsy. There are quite a   to balance when deciding whether a sample is malignant or not (eg cell size, shape, differentiation, numbers) I don't want to speak for either person involved here; but although both the pathologist want to do the best they can, they may have slightly different 'views'. The pathologist has been a small specimen of a larger lesion and has to make a determination about what is going on in it. It's not always possible to say with 100% certainty what is actually happening. Your surgeon has (I assume) seen you, seen the lesion in person, and hear you say that it's a new and recent occurrence. They may have   and decided that on the balance of probability that it is malignant, and that it should be removed. : the above is speculation, and merely offered as a   as to why they are saying different things. If this concerns you, then read the next section. As recommended, speak to the doctors involved- the pathologist and the surgeon. They should be happy to explain their reasoning to you and be able to clarify what they mean and why they made the decision they did. If that does not satisfy you, you always have the option to seek a second (in this case, third!) opinion. There may well be some pathologists reading this who are thinking   or similar.

A very simplified analogy: Inflammation is like a war zone on home turf, with your body's cells against bacteria/virus invaders (OR injured tissues OR sometimes for no reason).  Our body cells sometimes go all out spraying napalm and dropping bombs.  You may win the war but often with collateral damage.  The war zone can keep burning for a very long time - the fires often keep burning for a while the war is over, and leave areas of scorched land behind. NSAIDs are like firefighters to suppress the burning flames.	2017-04-01 07:11:00Z	DoctorWhom	1

11724	14284	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14284	Yes. There are scientific reasons and treatments involving worms and allergies or other immune system disorders. But the results are not overly conclusive and still understudied. This is based on the so called   in immunology. Short version to this: our immune system evolved in a world full of dirt and germs  where it had to be quite aggressive against all those threats and invasions in order to keep  our ancestors alive. In recent years – since Leuwenhoek, Semmelweiss, Lister, Koch and Pasteur – we learned that and how germs could make us ill and tried to eradicate all of them. Or at least keep them away from us as to limit the danger of getting infections.  That would theoretically translate into the very simple reasoning: Trying to eliminate all germs, or improving hygiene, ensures a much healthier population across the board. But the problem observed was that allergies were on the rise into previously unheard of dimensions despite the direct living environments getting cleaner and cleaner. That is, in modernised or Western societies allergies have become very widespread. In less developed nations the rise of allergies was seen as much less pronounced. The hypothesis is now that a lack of actual threats and "proper training" is directing the immune system to attack otherwise rather benign substances (like pollen) or even the own tissues (auto-immune disorders). Turning this process from its head back to its feet again it was then tried whether a deliberate infestation with once very common hookworms might alleviate the symptoms of sufferers. And apparently it sometimes did.  Apart from currently being still   promising there are downsides to its applications. The effects seem to rely quite heavily on early childhood exposure and diminish with age. Having a worm is not much fun and of course, once the worms have "modulated the immune system" you have to get treatment to get rid of them again (which might cause an impressive range of side-effects on its own;  ). And while overuse of certain hygienic agents, like disinfectants and antibiotics, are certainly a problem, cutting back radically on hygiene or even to introduce deliberate infections of any kind seem like an easy inference – and a bat droppings crazy stupid one on top. It's complicated and we're still figuring out much of the basics.  Good overviews are presented here:   and   and  . Although there were early speculations about this coming from Russian fringe doctors many decades ago and emerging in Western science in the seventies, the hypothesis really came into form with   and took off after German reunification provided a really large quasi-experimental corroboration for it. Another word for this is  . This whole concept is now even largely superseded (or  ?) with the  , including bacteria and even viruses. This presents a much more  -balanced view of "us"– taking for example also our whole microbiome into consideration and not just a few "key players" like the hookworm in question. More up-to-date and in a more scientifically constructed wording than the gross oversimplifications above are these papers: (2009) (2016) That means that the parasites are well known to be able to modulate the immune system response. But this does not translate into proven, always beneficial effects. It can also go very wrong and actually worsen any associated condition. We do not know with certainty how the parasites do it. We do not know with certainty which parasites might be good or bad for what. We do not know with certainty if early exposure (at a young age), where the observed effects seem strongest, is necessary and therefor a treatment for adults much less effective. Having parasites is not very pleasant, just copying their mechanism looks much more promising.  (2015) Especially in relation to asthma:

Based on your question, I'm assuming that your father is not using any analgesic or the one he's taking are not effective enough. Because most treatments are used without research demonstrating therapeutic results (2), it's difficult for me to describe   treatments. Still, I've seen severe cases where analgesics, including viscous lidocaine, were used (as buccal tx, NOT swallowed). Also, when pain has been reduced enough for mastication and swallowing to be tolerable, soft and pH neutral food can help bring satiety. Avoid any hard food that may injure the ulcers, as this will increase pain and healing time. Please make sure to discuss this issue with your father's MD, especially if he's not eating at all.

I would like to point out that this question might be to general for a complete answer but I will do my best in point out some points. When it comes to health, eating healthy is important regardless if your in a low stress or a high stress environment, and while I do realize you asked about eating healthy in a low stress environment I felt it was important to point out some of the stress inducing problem.  Stress causes the release of hormones in your blood stream and it arrives and affects your entire body (From lectures).
The extended exposure to stress has effects on cognitive and mental health, (Sonia J. et al.) and immune system (David N. et al.) among others. This one is probably self explanatory, between not eating the amount of vitamins required to problems such as obesity there's plenty we could talk about.  -For vitamins I like to refer to this very informative and complete website:
 -Due to byproduct of protein metabolism ammonia, excess of protein intake can have toxic effects(William V. et al.).

In general, exercise stresses the body, but the body then responds to that by making itself stronger not just to meet the extra demand but to actually exceed this (provided the exercise routine isn't too strenuous). If you do bodyweight exercises like   with weighted clothing then it is actually possible that with the extra weight you'll actually feel lighter than you felt before you started wearing weighted clothing due to increased muscle mass, at least up to some maximum weight.

11646	11702	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11702	When you go to the dentist the first thing she will do is not to fix that cavity, but an inspection of your teeth. This will give you a chance to meet and talk to the dentist before anything gets serious and you can ask all the questions you want.  The truth about the pain is, filling cavities used to be extremely painful in the long gone days before anaesthetics were invented. These days you get a jab, the part of your mouth with the sick tooth will go numb and you will not feel a thing during the treatment. Even after the anaesthetic wears off there won't be any pain as there is only pain during the cleaning of the cavity but it stops right after the tools are removed from the tooth, this is where teeth are different to flesh wounds.  On the other hand, if you wait too long you will be in for a lot of pain. From your description I would think that your teeth are overall rather healthy. A healthy tooth can be very sensitive even with a small hole that is not very deep. This means there is a lot of potential for the pain to become worse. At some point it will become permanent. This can happen suddenly. You may wake up in the middle of the night and will be in pure pain, as if you had a glowing hot iron in your mouth and you can't get rid of it. Also there will be no one close by to give you any real help (like a dentist could).  So, if you think going to the dentist is scary, not going is a lot scarier. How do I know all this? From experience. From my mothers side I inherited teeth that are prone to cavities so I had regular treatments starting with my milk teeth. The only dentist in the area believed in treating children   so they would remember the pain and look better after their teeth. This was forty years ago and any dentist with this kind of attitude today would not have their license for very long (or so I hope). This left me scared of dentists too and as an adult I didn't go for a couple of years, until one of my teeth became so sore as I described above. The pain was a lot worse than getting treated even without anaesthetics and there was no end to it.  Today I am more scared of   going. Because of the condition of my teeth there was a time where I have been more frequently to the dentist than to the hairdresser and these days, having been to   dentists ever since, I am not scared of going at all. 	2017-03-27 20:38:51Z	Flint	1
11646	11709	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11709	Dental Student here, I highly recommend that you go see the dentist. First if the cavity gets into the pulp, you will need Root Canal Therapy to save that tooth, plus a core, and crown. Which is expensive. If you get it treated early, a filling may be all you need. A third possibility is getting the tooth extracted and getting an implant, but that is expensive. Using the proper toothpaste can in fact help arrest the decay, but the decay that is already present is there to stay. Prevident 5000 which is high in fluoride and MI paste which is high in calcium and phosphate ions can help remineralize the tooth and make it "stronger." Regular cleanings are important, because they will clean your teeth and put fluoride varnish on which helps strengthen your teeth, also chewing gum with xylitol will help stimulate saliva which will help your teeth and keep the bacteria count to a minimum. 	2017-03-28 15:29:21Z	Ketan Patel	1

Von Neumann's theory on universal constructors captured the essentials of biochemistry long before the field of biochemistry came into existence, therefore the right approach in biology and medicine is to frame things in terms of robust machines that are going to be able to maintain themselves under a very wide range of conditions by adapting themselves.  Now, the human body has evolved to function optimally under conditions that involve eating a low fat, high whole grain carb diet and a lot of physical exercise. What has happened over many millions of years, is that our body has come to depend on sticking to such a lifestyle for optimal function, but adaptability means that you won't immediately collapse and die if your lifestyle differs from this significantly. What about empiric evidence to back this up? For a long time, the medical community didn't seriously investigate this, the Western lifestyle was used as the default model and only minor tweaks were investigated. It was found that eating less saturated fats, a bit more fruits and vegetables, and exercising a bit more was going to improve the general health. Only very recently have more radically different lifestyles been seriously investigated. E.g.   describes the health of the Tsimane people in Bolivia. As we can read   (the Lancet article is behind a paywall): To me, this empirical evidence goes beyond the specifics of the Tsimane lifestyle, it also confirms what I explained above, i.e. the human body has been adapted by natural selection so much to an indigenous lifestyle that straying away too far from this will damage the body. But because the human body is a well designed self repairing machine, it will adapt itself quite well to an unhealthy lifestyle. So, while you'll get atherosclerosis, it won't kill you for some considerable time. Another example. If you live in Nature, your salt intake won't be much higher than 0.1 grams per day, more than 50 times lower than what passes for a normal salt intake. Is this harmful or is our normal intake harmful? If you believe in what I'm advocating for then you should believe that 0.1 grams per day is not harmful and that possibly 5 grams per day could have negative health effects. A priori there are no good reasons to expect that 5 grams of salt per day would fix a biological flaw in our body. And indeed,  , you see that what passes for a normal blood pressure should be considered to be mild hypertension, this is masked due to the fact that we're all overdosing on salt. What about eating fat, don't carbs cause type 2 diabetes? As  , the problem starts with fat buildup in the muscles which causes insulin resistance which can eventually lead to type 2 diabetes. This shouldn't be a surprise if you consider where your calories would come from if you lived in an indigenous society. There is no cooking oil in the jungle. So, why would you assume that millions of years of evolution has led to some  flaw in your body design that is magically going to be cured by Tesco's extra virgin olive oil? That doesn't make sense to me, so you should not use any oil or at least limit it's use to very small amounts. Then if you stop or severely cut down on fats, take a lot of exercise and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and whole grains, your health should improve. You may ask how much fruits and vegetables you should eat. We can again approach this from a theoretical reasoning where we assume that the indigenous lifestyle yields optimal health. Here we can consider that indigenous people had little access to meat and ate no dairy products. This means that they would have had to get a fair fraction of all their essential amino acids from vegetables and grains.  The problem is then that some essential amino acids are difficult to get from non-meat, non-dairy products if you eat normal Western-diet sized portions (unless you eat special foods like tofu, but such special foods are hard to get in the jungle). So, this means that what passes for normal portions is too small. If you make some rough estimates of how much you should eat, you get to a figure of the order of 1 kg of fruits and vegetables combined per day. So, 500 grams of vegetables and 500 grams of fruits per day will yield a fair fraction of essential amino acids, it is thus a good guess for what a healthy intake should be. We can then assume that this intake of 1 kg of fruits and vegetables is something that our bodies are likely optimally designed for. While amino acids is not something we need to be concerned about unless you are a vegan, fruits and vegetables contain a lot of vitamins and minerals and fibers. So, even if you eat meat and dairy products, your body should be considered to be optimally designed to eat about 1 kg of fruits and vegetables. Eating a lot more fruits and vegetables than recommended as been put to the test only recently, the  : Now, as I mentioned above, indigenous people have a low meat intake, so it may be wise to limit your meat intake. But you must then make sure you're getting enough protein.	2017-03-23 23:27:54Z	Community	2

In general, there are a few rules to start with that should work for everyone. (Unless you're allergic to any of these items). Start counting calories.  Avoid wheat, gluten, dairy. Eat as much as you can fresh home made foods; quinoa, buckwheat, chicken, fish, vegetables. Rice and other grains are OK but not too much as they are high in carbs. Aim for high protein, low carbohydrates.  Cut down on sugar, and fruit (due to its sugar). No soda, caffeine.  No alcohol. Brush AND floss everyday evening (at least). And start moving. Every day. Doesn't have to be running, even not necessarily jogging if you can't. Just move, as fast as you can; brisk walking. Start let's say 15 minutes at 4mph or whatever speed you think is a bit faster then you normally walk. And incrementally increase every week. Consistency is key.

Others start out small because of issues during the pregnancy, and eventually become more typical. Others slow their rate of growth because something is wrong, such as an illness or a problem with nutrition. That's why growth is measured so frequently - it's a way to know if everything is still ok. This   says: Two children I know well enough to know their growth chart positions were in the 10th percentile throughout childhood. One of them is a girl and started her period quite a bit later than normal. Both are regular sized adults and completely healthy. They were just slow growers.  My understanding is that moving down the growth charts is something to look into, but just starting out small is not something to worry about. After all, 10% of babies are under the 10% mark - that's the definition of it. 	2017-03-22 12:12:28Z	Kate Gregory	2
11634	11653	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11653	The percentile system doesn't mean anything from one measure only.
The criteria behind it, is that the organism you are checking is growing up, so is mandatory   his grow process. This leads us to measure babies multiple times during the infant life (but also during the fetal life!!), and this allows us to create a  . Usually a baby under the   percentile is definite IUGR or SGA, differently.
Or, if he's above the   percentile, he's big for gestational age. For the same criteria I've explained before, being between the 10th and the 90th percentile with one measure, doesn't mean the baby is ok. Infact, in the medical field, if a baby is between the range above, but lose in a month  , this is considered like a baby under the 10th percentile. From this, you can understand really well the importance of the following up and constant measurements during his growing up life. Coming back to your question, no, this doesn't mean your baby will be forever small. Think about premature birth, for example: they grew up normally, but usually are small when born. This of course is a case that require follow up, not because he will have problems, but to monitor his grow and act on it, maybe with supplies or other.	2017-03-23 11:12:26Z	Gabri	1

When urinating, you usually wash out the patogens in the urethra, but some can still remain there. Then, if you don't urinate, bacteria can go up in the bladder and gives you patologies, like cystitis, or other type of infections.

With this statement I am referring to eat every component of the diet, like carbs, fats, proteins, vitamins and of course fibers. This is essential. The main problem with people that eat lots of fibers, is that they feel full fast and usually won't eat all the proper components. 
Problems you have provided, like abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation are in fact caused of not eating good enough: vitamins deficit can lead to abdominal pain, coagulation problems and so on; protein deficit can leat to muscular problem, problems in the healing of scars or in general dermatological problems and so on. So, eating a lot of fiber has no side effect if you integrate the other component of the diet.	2017-03-23 11:25:50Z	Gabri	1
11661	11668	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11668	There is research of stents and exercise! How much is enough? In fact there are exercise programmes, known as   designed to help those who have had some forms of cardiac disease or procedures-- including stent insertions. Cardiac rehabilitation has evidence to suggest that it is a beneficial programme for those who have suffered eg heart attacks or who who have had stents.  There is evidence to suggest that   too; though perhaps inadvisable in the context of having a sore groin from the femoral access used. Certain types of exercise, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT)  , though it should be noted that the study that suggested this had a relatively small sample size. It may have  , but again note 1) small sample size and 2) a surrogate marker (  (HRV)). It should be reasonable to conclude that other factors notwithstanding some forms of exercise is not harmful in and of itself following a stent. Of course,  - if those 'other factors' were that a person who has had a stent is terribly unfit and so has very poor heart function, or has other significant co-morbidities, or similar it may not be safe for them to exercise! And so to the next point: 'Why' questions can be tricky to answer; but in brief it may be tricky to do good, conclusive research as to whether having a stent affects marathon running. Research or trial design is a very broad topic to go into (it's a science unto itself), but it's hard to do well at the best of times. In this particular case there are several potential pitfalls. Stent or not,  . This may be due to   or in the context of  . So, say you have someone who sadly dies during a marathon, and they have a stent. How do you work out whether they died due to it not being safe to run because they have a stent, or for another reason? Stent or not, were they fit to run- are they a previously fit-and-healthy individual with a background of running before their procedure, or were they a sedentary individual who had a heart attack out the blue and leapt 'off the couch' to get fit after they had to have stents put in? In the absence of evidence, it's a judgement call. I can't and wouldn't wish speak for your doctor, but if they were to tell you that based on you being previously fit and well, and that you are doing well following the procedure you should be fine; if you then were to have something adverse happen, you may decide they had advised you poorly.

11586	11598	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11598	First of all, the study should not be trusted too much. Thirty six test subjects does not seem very much to me in order to make such a claim. However, &AtlLED's opinion in the comment differs from this. From the abstract (emphasis mine): However, I think it is clear that the heart-rate does seem to slow down. There is nothing to very little studies available so the rest of my answer is somewhat  . Therefore, an infants frontal lobe is not well developed at the age of 3 months or less.  Take a look at this   and notice the huge jump from 0 years to 2 years. The steepest growth is presumably around 0,5 years (just guessing from approximation the tangent). It seems therefore fairly reasonable to me to conclude that around the age of 6 months, the frontal lobe is well developed so that the infant is able to correctly address the risk of drowning. And as any normal human, they would start to   when they  . 
This panicking will cause an increase of heart rate and is the opposite of a bradycardia response.    Evolutionary speaking, it makes sense to have a survive-by-all-means mechanism that will be triggered as soon as one is in serious danger. Such a mechanism can be counterproductive in a very few examples, like here when the bradycardia response is reversed. Nevertheless, it is very useful in most cases and therefore, we have this mode.  I would therefore conclude (again, educated guessing) that the bradycardia response of babies was never "intended" (1) and is just a side product of them not being able to judge a situation correctly. A "standard" newborn male infant weighs around 3kg, is about 48cm tall and its head circumference is roughly 34cm, so the radius is 10 cm. Assuming the body is cylindric, this would give us a density of 5.8g/cm^3 (V = π r^2 h, density = V / mass) ( ). I weigh roughly 70kg, am about 180cm tall and my head radius is maybe 30cm, which means my density is about 103.8g/cm^3. 
 Concluding, an infants buoyancy is significantly larger than mine. As the infant grows and gains weight, the buoyancy will decrease until the density reaches the density of a full grown human during adolescents.  This does not explain why the heart rate is so low, but it is another factor as to why infants are quite good at swimming. (1): Intended is a pretty bad word here. I mean, the argument was about evolution and not creation. I meant by this that the bradycardia response is just a side-product of multiple factors: The survive-by-all-means mechanism in adults and the baby's inability to correctly asses danger.	2017-03-17 18:19:06Z	Narusan-in-coma	4

11575	11592	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11592	This is quite interesting because I've heard MANY patients with this same belief. Some people believe that bathing when sick will make you more sick. Some women do not bathe during their menstrual period because their mothers told them it would lead to some adverse effects. Even some mothers who just gave birth do not take a bath in the immediate post-partum period because they believe it will be harmful.  In all the medical books I've read, I've never encountered one that cautions against bathing when someone is sick. I also searched PubMed just now and I didn't find a study that details the negative effects of bathing during a sickness. On the contrary, there are a lot of studies that encourages people to bathe during illness, especially when they are febrile. In fact, it is a common practice in the medical profession to advise patients to have a sponge bath when their temperature is up. Aside from the cooling effect of bathing, it also cleans the body and prevents the spread of infection. The only situations I could think of when I would advise patients to not take a bath is when a patient is too weak to stand up and take a bath or is at risk of falling by doing so. But then again, these patients can still have sponge baths in their bed. What they're not allowed is to ambulate, but they're allowed to bathe. Also, if patients have skin lesions or contraptions that shouldn't be wet; but then again, these can easily be covered by waterproof dressings and the patient can still take a bath. The last thing I could think of why I wouldn't allow a patient to bathe is when a patient is hypothermic (or has low body temperature). But then again, they can have warm baths instead. So overall, I really couldn't think of a reason--and I haven't read any--why baths can worsen illnesses. I got interested to know the source of this belief, and I've come across this article.  Interesting, right?
Anyway, if you find a logical, scientific explanation for the harmful effect of bathing during an illness, please tag me. I'd like to know it too.	2017-03-17 05:16:05Z	Rachelle Ann Facistol Mata	5
11566	11639	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11639	I am studying counselling and psychotherapy in university and there are 3 main different approaches of therapy offered in counselling and psychotherapy. With Humanistic therapy, the client takes the lead in all sessions - hence the name   in Person-Centred Therapy.  Therapy is concentrated on the here and now, and the therapist will listen to what the client says and reflects it back to the client in order for the client to   what is said and work through the issues themselves with the therapist's help.  The therapist in humanistic approaches will not put forward a position of expertise.  Only the client knows where they are in therapy. With Psychodynamic therapy, the therapist is diferent in the sense that they will analyse what the client says and look at past events which may have lead to the problems in the present.  A psychodynamic therapist might give some 'homework' or some tasks to carry out which might help. Gestalt therapy is an example being that although primarily humanistic (it concentrates on the here and now), the therapy does have a small element of psychodynamic too.  Gestast therapy may use techniques such as the   or exaggerated body language. You said, If you are looking for some direction and you are seeing a purely Person-Centred therapist, then you may be seeing the wrong person.

So it doesn't really stretch the muscle, it reduces the tendency of the body to resist the stretch. Expansion: PNF stretching is a fairly advanced, intense stretching technique that uses isometric contractions while the muscle is in a near maximal stretched state. This contraction is held for anywhere from 3-20 seconds, although   that there isn't really any difference between shorter and longer intervals in the stretch. The mechanism is not really understood, the main theories currently is that if affects the stretch reflex, reciprocal inhibition and autogenic inhibition. The stretch reflex is due to a muscle spindle (nerve receptor), that when a muscle is stretched suddenly, it sends a signal to the brain to contract the muscle. The greater the stretch, the more forceful the contraction. If you increase the ROM of the muscle, you are less likely to fire the stretch reflex. (As an aside, when the doctor whacks your knee with the hammer to see it twitch, that's the stretch reflex in action). Reciprocal inhibition - Agonist/antagonist muscles are muscles in opposition to each other such as biceps/triceps, hamstrings/quadriceps, etc. When an agonist muscle contracts, the spindle sends a message to the brain for the antagonist to relax. It is suggested that this mechanism is altered by PNF stretching. Autogenic inhibition - The golgi tendon organ fires when tension increases in the muscle, either due to contraction or to stretch, causing the agonist muscle to relax. This would override the tendency of the muscle to tighten under stress and relax, enabling a further ROM. For additional reading,   on PNF stretching discussing the various possible mechanisms of action, along with varying techniques of PNF (Contract/Relax, and Contract/Relax/Antagonist/Contract).

11548	11549	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11549	Short answer? Most likely none. Better answer? What you are asking is what we health professionals call "Screening tests", which are by definition highly sensitive but relatively non-specific routine tests that are cost-effective to conduct routinely in HEALTHY population at risk for a particular disease. Things like Prostate Antigen or Occult Blood in Stool may fall in this category. So, there won't be a catch-all for what you want. Especially because "cancer" is, as you probably know, not a disease but rather a cluster of them, with different epidemiologies. For example, it makes sense to check PSA in a male over 40 years of age, as screening for prostate cancer, because it is a slow disease with very good prognosis if caught early. Same PSA, same pathology, but now your patient is a man identical to the first example, except he is now 80 years old. It is in fact much more probable that you will get an altered result and that he will in fact have prostate cancer. However, it's pretty futile to check his PSA because even if it was through the roof and he did in fact have cancer, at that age the benefit of actually making the diagnosis and treating him more likely than not will be outweighed by the cost of treatment (speaking both in terms of money and quality of life). In short. Yes, there are such a thing as screening tests. Yes, they are great tools if employed judiciously. No, there are no catch-all batteries of tests that could detect cancer in healthy individuals in a cost-effective way.	2017-03-14 22:43:57Z	Gregorio Litenstein	3
11543	11558	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11558	The gestational age as given by the ultrasound tells how far the pregnancy is from the last menstrual period (not the conception date). According to  , first trimester ultrasounds are generally within 3-5 days of accuracy if performed during the first 8-11 weeks and about 10 days accurate if performed in 12th-22nd wks of pregnancy. Let's break down your dates for a clearer picture.  Based on this ultrasound, her LMP should be around Dec 9 (give or take 10 days), and the baby was conceived sometime around Dec 23 (give or take 10 days). So from the ultrasound, you can infer the ff: Remember though that these dates are just estimates and are only based on what the statistics are of the general population.  Her LMP, as you said, was around Dec 23, which is only four days from the estimated possible LMP; so the LMP she is declaring is very much plausible. If we follow her LMP and we assume that her menses are regular in length as with the general population, we can assume that the conception happened around 14days from that period (give or take). So let's go to the final question: Are you the father? Based on her LMP, it's possible. Are you not the father? It's also possible. You haven't given us other details about this scenario. Are you the only person she's sleeping with at that time? Is she sure about her LMP?  So what should you do to be sure? From where I'm from, a paternity test could be requested. You can request this after the baby is delivered or while the baby is still in utero (although this latter suggestion has some risks involved). I'm not very sure though about how your relationship can be tilted with you requesting this and how the mother would take this suggestion. Good luck and I hope you can talk this through and sort this out soon.	2017-03-15 03:19:04Z	Rachelle Ann Facistol Mata	6

From the CD site: The issue there is that even the CDC knows that immunity can be undetectible (for what reason I do not know), and yet you are protected.  If it's a vaccine induced infection, I think you'd be subject to the same risk of false negatives.  The only way to measure is titer though.  In fact, you cannot   know the current vaccine schedule is leaving you protected.  I have a sibling that has received a particular vaccine a number of times (3 times more than what is considered necessary) and regardless, if she has a titer pulled, it shows no immunity (not varicella, we had that as children).  We don't typically titer all people because it isn't generally a good use of resources.  You can though, request one to be done & certainly after an outbreak of varicella, to simply see if another shot is warranted or not.

You won't be taking something you don't need, or more of something than you need. The risk is that you will mix things or take too much (you've dismissed these as not a worry) or that it will be too much hassle, while you're sick, to figure out what to take. People like the idea of "take this, you'll feel better" without a lot of thinking.  I react poorly to antihistamines, so I take separate ingredients to give me control. This is now reasonably difficult, since buying decongestants without added ingredients keeps getting harder and harder. That's why I've asked doctors and pharmacists about my approach. Should I just give up and buy decongestants with acetaminophen in them already? But they all tell me I am actually doing it right, with the proviso that you have to be prepared to put in the mental effort to get all the doses right.	2017-03-14 15:41:34Z	Kate Gregory	3

For what it may be worth, I personally always ask my patients (after taking the entire history and doing the appropriate physical, of course), to summarize which of their symptoms are actually the most bothersome for them, and specifically treat those. The end result will very much vary depending on available formulations, cost of them (and whether the patient can actually afford them), among other things. I sometimes combine single-drugs (say Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen and an Antitussive), or I might combine something that has both Ibuprofen and an Decongestant with pure Acetaminophen, and so on and so forth. More often than not, as long as dosages and overlaps are kept in mind, it is possible to make MANY effective combinations of symptomatic treatment for a given situation. I dare say most physicians have a couple or more "go-to" combinations for similar situations, depending on some of the factors I've outlined above.	2017-03-14 23:24:45Z	Gregorio Litenstein	0

But they aren't what pop culture advertises them as.  Hyperthemsia first. It is the ability of a person to remember extremely detailed events from most of their life. But it is of limited use. It is an extremely self centered memory condition. Most people can only remember in great detail events that are important to them. Other things they they encountered along the way, they won't remember any better than the rest of us. And they are just as susceptible to false memories as the average person. Given a date they can generally give very detailed descriptions of personally important memories from that date.  Eidetic memory is the ability to look at an object once and remember everything about it for a short duration afterwards. A person with eidetic memory can glance at a long paragraph for a handful of seconds, then close his/her eyes, and, using the brain's ability to remember the image just seen, read it word for word back to you. Five minutes later mistakes will be made in the recall. 30 minutes later he/she will be able to give an extremely detailed summary of the paragraph. Very few can reproduce it perfectly after a few hours. About 2 to 10 percent of children below the age of 12 have this ability and it gradually fades away as they get older. Very few adults claim to have it. This is a short term memory ability. There are no proven cases of someone with a long term eidetic memory. Photographic memory is defined as the ability to read text and reproduce it later without the imagery that eidetic memory has. If there are people with this ability, they aren't discussing it openly. Since there are no verifiable cases of this existing, there is no need to discuss it further.    	2017-03-10 01:27:36Z	KCasper	2

What got me motivated was an old article that I read about a clinical trial done by the University of Wisconsin around 1980. (Sorry, I could not find it today). IIRC, half of the group was given Prozac with no exercise, and the other half ran but was not given any pills. At the end of 10 weeks, the runners were less depressed than the other group. After reading that, I decided to try running in the morning before work. I ran as far as I could until I was out of breath, and then walked back home. I made myself run a little further each time. One day, I could run much further; I didn't get out of breath, my legs just got tired. After only 6 weeks, I was amazed at how GOOD I felt! My depression and anxiety vanished.

11458	11676	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11676	Masturbating does not decrease fertility or sex drive Historically, masturbation was discouraged for a variety of reasons including the thought that it lead to mental health problems.  However, that was disproved.  The abstract of   states Masturbation was a diagnosable psychological condition until DSM II in 1968. (Ley, 2014) The American Medical Association consensually declared masturbation as normal in 1972. Due to the false ideas on masturbation and mental health, there are not a lot of documented studies but I am going to concentrate on fairly recent studies to eliminate the falsehoods. Another point of note mentioned in   is that Since sperm are short-lived, they must constantly be replenished, so  . Plus sperm is produced during the whole of the male life. If the dead sperm is not released through sex or masturbation, it will automatically be released by the body. Some males find that they are more prone to   during times of less frequent sexual activity because they are not ejaculating as frequently from masturbation or sex with a partner, and in fact — as @Gabri pointed out, and studies have confirmed — high ejaculation frequency was related to decreased risk of total prostate cancer  . There is even less around for female masturbation, but one study suggests that female orgasm induces ovulation   so that would suggest that the chances of conception would be higher.  The difference between men and women is that  .  The human female has all their eggs at birth and no more is being produced. Once they are all released, that's it. Coleman, E. (2003).

Moreover, some specialists say that masturbation can prevent, or at least decrease, the risk of develop a prostate cancer. Keep in mind that these are new studies, so data are too few to create a rule.
With the informations that researchers obtain, they can say that the risk is reduced (1).
But as I stated before, there are not enough data to confirm this (2). In addition to this, the spermatogenic cycle is different from the female one: female have a fixed number of egg follicles, while men production of sperm is cycle (Spermatogenesys take 64 days, and it's continuous). So, if sperm cells are not used for fertilize egg cells, they will die and after short time the cycle of production start again (please, keep in mind that the process is way more difficult and specific; this is a overview to explain what the user asked). So, no. Masturbation doesn't decrease your fertility and if studies are confirmed, it may prevent from prostate cancer.

Be aware: Values outside a reference range are not necessarily pathologic, and they are not necessarily abnormal in any sense other than statistically. On the other hand, values within the reference range can be pathologic even though they are "normal". This is why reference range is actually a better term than "normal" range.

But I expect you're more concerned about catching something communicable. As the article says, urine is sterile. People with open sores and runny noses aren't allowed in the pool (there's generally a large sign about this) and the chlorine in the water is designed to kill the germs from the people who ignore the signs.  The article's risk isn't even about being in the water - it's about breathing and having uncovered eyes near the water.

After a meal, fats trigger gallbladder contraction, which results in the release of the bile into the small intestine. The bile helps to digest fats. The liver is connected to the small intestine by the common bile duct. When your gallbladder is removed, the bile will flow from the liver via the bile duct directly into the small intestine. This continuous flow of the bile can irritate the intestine and trigger diarrhea. After gallbladder removal, the bile is still delivered into the intestine, so all the fat should be properly digested as before. Sometimes, during gallbladder removal, a small stone accidentally passes into the common bile duct and blocks the flow of the bile through it. This prevents fat digestion. The undigested fat moves further into the colon, where it is partially broken down by normal intestinal bacteria (which results in gas) and partially excreted in the stool (which results in smelly, floating and pale stools) ( ).	2017-10-25 08:03:10Z	Jan	2

11436	11439	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11439	This comes from my high-school chemistry book (in German):  I think, if school books teach that xylitol prevents carries, this argument must be pretty solid. (School books are usually very conservative and only teach bullet-proof things, at least in Germany). I can't tell exactly you   xylitol and sorbitol prevent carries. It probably has something to do with that neither we nor bacteria are able to process any source of energy other than carbohydrates, and so the carries bacteria does not have enough "food".    Following from this, your diet must consist of glucose (or polysaccharides which will be broken down into glucose), otherwise you would have starved to death! Therefore,   there will be enough "food" for carries because of polysaccharides in other foods that we eat.
If you brush your teeth regularly and have a good oral health, there will be almost no gains (apart from the diet/weight bit) by using a sugar substitute! Some sources and studies about Xylitol and dental health:     Judging from all the studies, I would just have a normal diet and brush my teeth regularly. For me, it is too much effort to change my eating habits, try to eat foods that only contain alcohol sugar when the benefits are not even clear. 
  however that xylitol   prevent carries if used consequently as a sugar substitute and no other polysaccharides are consumed.   (1). But fluoride tooth paste prevents carries it at least to a very similar extend.
Lastly, one has to consume xylitol at least twice a day to get a positive effect [AADP article], but only a maximum of 8g, as osmotic diarrhoea is a major side effect.

11435	11522	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11522	Something that is worth mentioning right out of the gate is a   (see also  ). These are sudden seizures, generally experienced by young children, resulting from an especially high fever. The generally accepted (although not fully confirmed) mechanism is via something called   (see e.g.  ). Hyperthermia, among other processes , triggers an imbalance in blood pH and pCO , which in turn can increase brain activity, leading to a seizure. Children (generally below the age of six) are especially vulnerable. With that in mind, it would make sense that heat could be a possible seizure trigger. That said, there are some things to bear in mind. First, children who experience a febrile seizure are likely to never have a seizure again; these seizures are generally not linked to epilepsy, although a family history of seizures may contribute to this. Therefore, there are two questions to ask: Can heat stroke cause seizures, and is this more prevalent for people with epilepsy? We also need to consider that instances of heat stroke can be quite different. Often, it is convenient to divide cases into two categories: Exertional heat stroke (EHS), and non-exertional/classical heat stroke (NEHS/CHS).   gives a rather nice comparison on page 551. There are a few differences that pertain to our case, some of which I've copied here: Notice that respiratory alkalosis is described as more common classic heat stroke, which afflicts children, whereas   is more prevalent in exertional heat stroke. Interestingly enough, I haven't been able to find any information on the latter   seizures, although I have seen references indicating it can arise as a byproduct of seizures, especially tonic-clonic ("grand mal") seizures. It is, of course, well-known that heat stroke can trigger once-off seizures in people, often including small children (which should be apparent from some of the above). This has been well-studied in, of all creatures, dogs, which have unfortunately high mortality relates, often from being left trapped in a car or other area which rapidly becomes very hot.   states that an astonishing   of dogs who suffer from heat stroke experience seizures in the process;   ( ) or something else. I don't have comparable statistics for humans (I assume the mortality rates are better than the 50%+ I've seen quote for dogs), but it's clear that heat stroke can, and often will, cause seizures. Again, though, these seizures - like febrile seizures - generally do not recur. They are distinct and separate from epileptic seizures. Therefore, our second question is still unanswered.    (why people use all caps is beyond me) are full of stories of people with epilepsy suffering seizures purportedly due to heat stroke, heat exhaustion, or something similar. I'm assuming these are cases of exertional heat stroke. However,  . They may be entirely coincidental. A person with epilepsy may have a seizure brought on by something unrelated to the primary cause of their epilepsy. There are some exceptions - but they occur predominantly in children. I stated before that children who experience a febrile seizure are likely to never have another. This is true, but there are underlying conditions which may produce febrile seizures repeatedly, or, rather, make it more likely for heat-related seizures to occur. Two important ones are   and  , also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI). The latter may be regarded as a special case of the former. Both are genetic, caused by mutations in the  ; they may or may not be inheritable. Essentially, mutations in SCN1A (or perhaps another gene) occasionally inhibits   from working properly, which in term can lead to a seizure. The links between high temperatures and the channels are more tenuous, though   have suggested that in cases of GEFS+, heat may impact the voltage across the channels, further impacting their ability to properly function (see also  , studying mice with Dravet Syndrome). In conclusion, then, it appears that I do think that an appropriate analogy to draw here is with photosensitive epilepsy, as you did. While rapidly flashing lights   lead to a seizure, this is generally limited to a subset of those with epilepsy.	2017-03-13 01:23:20Z	HDE 226868	2

The primary nutritional benefits of citrus fruits are mainly vitamin C (ascorbic acid),  .  Luckily, it appears that according to   the bio-availability of "artificial" vitamin C is not markedly reduced, and so supplements can be used. There are other nutrients that fruits, though not only citrus, provides that may be unhealthy to cut completely out of your diet.    are a collection of plant-based chemicals that may have a multitude of benefits to health, but are not standard vitamins.  Dietary fiber is also an important component of your diet that can often be provided by fruits, citrus or otherwise. In summary, taking supplements of at least vitamin C is shown to be able to replace real citrus fruit intake for that nutrient, but there may be other nutrients that you should introduce through other foods (legumes and animal proteins are a good source of folate, as well as fortified grains) or through another supplement.  There are also several   that may be helpful while reducing tooth decay, assuming you brush after to reduce sugar left for mouth bacteria.	2017-03-06 12:21:49Z	Zintlions	2

Paper is still sometimes used in smaller practices, but rarely. In the USA physician documentation is called notes, not letters. Letters generally are directed to a particular individual, for example to a specialist or work note, etc. I'm not sure what a mask is?  In EHR there are usually templates that are brought into a note.  They have pretyped sections with blanks you can jump to and type in details.  Or there are click boxes that auto-write the text of the findings you select into the note.  They bring in things from vitals to lab values to medications to diagnoses/PMH/etc. Daily workflow wise, ideally you're able to finish the note with the patient in the room or immediately after leaving.  But in our over-stretched system, often physicians end up with a bunch of charting to finish at the end of the day.  That includes physical findings that are remembered and input later.

One offered medication. You were concerned about depending on them rather than learning to handle situations yourself, and about possible side effects or damage to yourself from those pills. These are wonderful things to discuss with that doctor. You can ask about side effects, you can ask if the doctor thinks you need to be on the medications indefinitely or just while you learn to handle difficult situations, and so on. You can also ask about needing higher doses for more difficult situations. Once you thoroughly understand what the doctor is suggesting and why, and the benefits and risks of it, you can decide whether you want to take it and how you will know whether you want to keep taking it or not. One recommended just getting healthier overall. A great question to ask that doctor is why that might help? Perhaps you're sleeping very poorly. Perhaps some blood tests have shown you are suffering from deficiencies that might cause anxiety. You need a reason to believe that exercise and healthy food will help the anxiety, right? That said, living a healthy live often means living a happy life with less worry, so if you can afford (time and money) to walk more, spend time outside, eat fresh food you cooked yourself, and take up an active hobby, I would encourage you to do that as a good thing in itself that might happen to lower your panic situation too. In addition to asking more questions from the two doctors you've already spoken to, you can look into counseling or therapy. There are many kinds!   is often suggested for anxiety - rather than discussing your childhood and trying to find out why you react as you do, it focuses on teaching you specific skills for coping with things that distress you today.

Hair generally falls out at a rate of 50 to 100 strands of hair a day. And regrowth of the hair generally matches that rate. Longer hair is more noticeable than short. And our hairs are more likely to come out all at once when stressed. Long hair might also break releasing a portion of the strand, a problem that short hair doesn't have. When you are in the shower you aren't going to notice 2 or 3 short strands falling out. Strands of long hair are very noticeable.  Now, there is one related issued tied to this subject. Hair that is frequently pulled on will fall out faster. Hair that is kept in tight hair styles or is constantly being tugged on by it owner will fall out faster than normal. But that is due to the roots literally being tugged out of the head. The weight of hair alone can't do this. It is problem that favors long hair.

11404	11406	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11406	At the age of fifty five, I received a diagnosis of severe ADHD.  ADHD has significantly affected my life, threatened my marriage, and made my professional career...challenging. I went to see a psychiatrist for marriage counseling and it was there that I found out I had ADHD.  Up til that point I had no idea.  None.  In retrospect, my symptoms were so obvious it was ludicrous that nobody had twigged to it before, but when I was growing up there wasn't much awareness of ADHD. Just receiving the diagnosis (I don't take drugs, as after fifty five years I have already learned a lot of coping mechanisms that allow me to function fairly well) has made a huge difference in my life.  Once my husband learned that I didn't forget to do things because I was careless, or didn't care, and we both learned how to help me lean on his ability to keep track of things, my marriage was worlds better. No mental health professional is going to scoff at your observation that you might have Aspergers.  If you have concerns, do a little googling and find one who lists experience with Aspergers and give him (or her) a call.  At the very least, a good counselor can help you develop coping strategies for any problems that might be troubling you.  And as for billing, tell a prospective counselor about your concerns.  Usually they are very good at billing in such a way that insurance companies understand and accept.  It would be ridiculous for a health insurance company to refuse to pay for a test just because the test comes back negative.  All there has to be is a reasonable suspicion that a pathology might be present, and in any case an evaluatory meeting should be covered. I would also mention that providers and employers are prohibited from discriminating against individuals with mental disabilities.  After I received my diagnosis I was fairly open about it with friends and co-workers and even potential employers, and I haven't noticed that it has impacted my life negatively.  We've gotten a lot more accepting of peoples' differences.	2017-03-04 00:48:24Z	Francine DeGrood Taylor	1

However, functioning well as a human being isn't just about being a capable professional - it's also about having quality interpersonal relationships if possible, and that can be a hurdle for some people with Asperger's. You haven't touched on this specifically in your post so I have no idea what your situation is in this respect, but if you're a typical person with Asperger's whose social life consists mainly in having conversations on the Internet you may want to rethink whether some form of treatment would benefit you or not. If you have a solid social life and you're certain you wouldn't benefit from treatment, I suggest simply forgetting all about it. It doesn't add anything to the bottom line to know if you have Asperger's or not. If you just want to find things out about yourself that you didn't know before you could try researching your genealogy instead, it's a lot more socially acceptable than  seeing a mental health professional.	2017-03-15 23:33:08Z	DepressedDaniel	1

So I provide my thought on this for your reference. I have to say that you probably already in the safest place during an earth quake in a building for two reasons:  1) rooms for big scanners are usually build with solid concrete and very likely to be strengthened further comparing with standard concrete building for accomodation or office. That makes the room very unlikely to collapse during an earth quake.  2) MRI machine is basically a giant piece of metal. If earth quake strikes during your scan, you have already surrounded and protected by this heavy and strong metal structure. This makes your situation even safer as you will be well protected even the building collapse.  Based on my personal experience on earth quakes, I think you will be pretty safe even there is a magnitude 8 or less earth quake happen during your MRI scan. For the quakes that more than magnitude 8, shallow and close by, well, good luck.	2017-03-03 06:23:18Z	Chris Gao	2

Clasped in the hemoglobin molecules in your blood cells is a pigment called porphyrin, which is not water soluble and can be toxic.  The liver assists in breaking down those pigments into dozens of more water soluble parts that make up bilirubin so they can be flushed out in the urine.  These parts are yellowish, which is why people with jaundice look yellow, and why pee is yellow, etc.  Jaundice happens when the liver isn't keeping up, which can be a result of hepatitis. Viruses in general are very fragile and cannot survive long in the presence of oxygen or acidic things like soda, or even in direct sunlight due to ultraviolet radiation.  Even most airborne viruses require aerosol droplets like in a sneeze to live long outside of a body.  Viruses generally cant survive high levels of oxidative stress themselves, (even though once they have infected a cell, many viruses reproduce better when the cell itself is under oxidative stress.) Bacteria could possibly live in these conditions though.  There are bacteria that can survive really harsh conditions.  Some heartburn is said to be caused by bacteria called H. Pylori that can live in the crazy acidic conditions of the stomach.  Some rod shape bacterial are hard to kill because they have tough little clones of themselves in their bodies called endospores that have been known to survive boiling water for long periods of time. So the short version, viruses have almost zero chance of surviving in soda, but it might possible for bacteria to do it if it got really contaminated somehow. Also, if a well gets really contaminated with feces, there is a possibility of getting Hepatitis A.	2018-02-19 04:32:52Z	Steve White	2

Iron, for example, will be held in the small intestine until the blood level lowers enough for safe absorption by which time it might just be pushed out of the body.  Zing is regulated by secretions in urine and sweat. Any you ingest, or breath in (unsafe welding practices), will be absorbed by the blood stream in a rather reckless fashion. Then the body will filter it down to normal levels. Before your body accomplishes this task you might be subjected to symptoms of zinc poisoning.

Mine seem to use it to listen to my lungs as I breathe, and I've seen them used to listen for valve sounds or other oddnesses in a baby's heartbeat. The actual rate can be determined other ways: the stethoscope is more for observing the sounds in your chest. They may move on quickly from a spot because they can't hear anything useful at all, or because they can hear that everything sounds fine. Anecdotally, I can tell you that when I had growths in my lungs that caused an almost constant cough, doctors held their stethoscopes in place for quite a while at a time, and now that those growths are all gone, they listen for a shorter time in each place and then say "your lungs sound completely clear."

11375	11376	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11376	Let us start by saying that  The concept of manipulating urine pH in order to accelerate the excretion of certain drugs is  . It is related to acid-base properties of drugs, as most drugs are weak acids or bases (I will not go into detail about this here, as it is a very basic concept in pharmacology, and can be looked up in most textbooks. You can also read a bit about it  ). The mechanism of increasing excretion rate of certain drugs is related to a phenomenon called " ". Basically it means that since acids will be ionized (become charged) in basic pH and bases will be ionized in acidic pH, and ionized species have difficulties passing through membranes, changing urine pH can eventually cause a certain drug to concentrate in the urine.  (drugs pass from blood to urine according to their ability to pass membranes. In general, if a drug is uncharged it can go back and forth, but if it becomes charged, it would be more difficult for it to move across membranes, so it is essentially "stuck" where it became charged, which is preferably the urine). In other words, the normal range of urine pH is 4.6-8 (see  ), which means that it fluctuates between acidic and basic values (pH value of 7 is neutral). When the urine is  ,   molecules that pass from the blood to the urine become ionized (charged), and then cannot go back into the blood (i.e. they are   and are excreted from the body more quickly).  When the urine is  ,   molecules that pass from the blood to the urine become ionized and are excreted from the body more quickly. To address your specific question: The commonly accepted method for making the urine more basic (i.e. alkalinization) is to administer sodium bicarbonate  . I found a   about administering sodium bicarbonate orally, but it is not the common practice. Also note that methamphetamine is a weak base (pKa = 9.87, according to  ), so it will be excreted more quickly by   of the urine, and not   (acidification is usually done with vitamin C). Finally, I would like to point out that one tablespoon of baking soda in 8 oz of water is not very precise and has a relatively high potential for error, which may lead to too high urine pH.

These are broad categories that our brains handle somewhat separately. People frequently do sustain a brain injury to the left side of the head that damages his or her ability to process language and speech without affecting any other cognitive abilities. Our ability to utilize language is somewhat separate in the brain from areas responsible for the ability to reason, remember or use muscles.  So transient forgetting of spellings of common words would be processed in the language areas of the brain, and deficits of that ability are called Aphasia.  Forgetting daily chores falls into the category of Amnesia and is handled by a different area of the brain. But your examples are about as non serious as they can get. Everyone has minor lapses in cognitive ability. So I'm hesitant to suggest seeing a doctor as I don't want to be blamed for a bunch of people getting laughed at when they go see their doctor for symptoms that lack of sleep may cause. Pose some more serious examples or extensive repeated lapses of forgetfulness or difficulty with words, or motor control, and I would have no problem suggesting you speak with a doctor.

You'll probably want to model things based on the death rates for certain causes, rather than the total number of deaths from such causes, even though both numbers are published in the reports on "Deaths: Final Data" linked above; this would take care of the fact that the US population hasn't historically been stagnant over time. Specifically, Table 11 on page 55 of the 1997 NVSS report, and Table 11 on page 46 of the   have these numbers; other tables in the said reports are often only for certain subsets of the population, or give the number of total deaths, instead of the death rate per 100,000 people. If that sounds like too much work, it might be worth noticing that historical life expectancy tables by year for the US are widely available. I found a few relevant sources by searching for "life expectancy by year in the US" (and would add relevant links if I had the StackExchange reputation to do so).	2017-02-28 09:08:19Z	Casey	1

-Immigration: Some races are more prone than others statistically
-Technology: With more access to technology people are more likely to grow up antisocial, and obese.
-Age: The baby boomers all will be at least 60 by this time most of them even in their late 60s or 70s and they will make up a significant portion of the people getting disease like diabetes, arthritic, depression, cancer, obesity, etc.
-Generational values: The teenagers of 2025 born 2007-2013 will have different values then teenagers growing up today(people born in the late 90s or early-mid 2000s) and it may be more acceptable for them to use different drugs like heroin which is becoming popular again unfortunately leading to autoimmune, depression. If they are growing up around people who are indoors constantly because of video games and I-pads they obviously will be more prone to health problems just by being sedentary and not getting enough sunlight. In fact, I would argue that in 2025 the healthiest group of people would be those born between 1975-2005, partly for that reason. 
-Population:The world population is going to be roughly 8 billion people in 2025, over 2 billion more since 1995 meaning more people with these problems.
-Unknown causes: Some things like autism we don't know what causes it, but 1 in 15 people having autism in 2025 is damn near unbelievable. There may be other unexplained causes which may contribute to these problems, but I know I knocked at least 50 percent of them out for you. Hope this helped.	2017-02-28 02:57:22Z	Person	0

11331	11334	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11334	The same is true for the body mass index. In general, people with a higher BMI have a higher chance of getting obesity-related illnesses than those with a BMI in the 18-25 range. But of course, there are exceptions like the one you mention. That's no reason to discard the entire BMI, because it does work in many cases. It's easier than other predictors (such as abdominal circumference). Another example would be age, as a predictor of mortality. It's safe to assume that in general, a 90-year-old would die sooner than a 25-year-old. But it's not true that no 25-year-olds die before any 90-year-old. For the second part of your question: obesity is defined as a BMI >30. In that sense, we can say that Heath would be obese. But once again, this "label" is not flawless. He's probably got a lower probability of getting obesity-related illnesses than someone with a BMI of 29.9 based entirely on a bad diet and lack of exercise.  TL:DR; BMI isn't a flawless predictor, but it's ease-of-use causes it to still be used.	2017-02-27 11:32:52Z	Jasper	5
11331	11365	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11365	Let's not conflate two different problems with BMI here. One the one hand you can have a low body fat percentage and still have a high BMI, but that only applies to body builders who exercise at a near professional level. Such a person will not get wrongly diagnosed by his or her doctor of being overweight. So, this shouldn't be a problem, however, as Carey Gregory points out, some insurance companies in the US make decisions about coverage and premiums purely based on BMI, which can lead to unjust decisions. A more practical problem with BMI is that it will underestimate the risk of cardiovascular problems and diabetes in people of certain ethnicities, particularly Asians. As  , Asians should keep their BMI below 23 kg/m^2. Then having cleared up these two real issues with the BMI, let's consider the context in which the argument for a fat tax and the denial of medical services are made in the sources quoted by the OP. The medical problem that at hand is that health problems caused by a poor diet combined with lack of exercise  account for the lion's share of health care costs. The US is a special case where 50% of the health care costs is due to an inefficient system, in most other Western countries, the burden of health care costs to society is about 10% of GDP. But even that 10% of GDP is mostly due to people eating too much fat, salt and sugar and not doing enough exercise. The people who choose to eat too many Big Macs are not only making me pay for my health care, they are actually limiting my health care options. The health care industry is hard at work at fixing the bodies of people who through their own faults, have wrecked their bodies, therefore I don't have to count on being treated in an optimal way. If at age 90 I would need a new kidney, I will be rejected because of my age despite having the fitness of a 60 year old by that time.  There are also costs for society outside of health care. Your car is   because the workers at the factories where cars are made are not making the right lifestyle choices. If you buy a plane ticket, you're paying more because transporting heavier people requires more fuel, the costs are shared by all passengers; people only pay for their extra  checked luggage above their allowance, not your checked fat.  . The fat tax mentioned here is a fee that overweight people would have to pay. Contrast that with the notion of a "fat tax" in the source quoted by the OP. There it's about imposing a VAT on fat, which is a reasonable way to get the population to stick to a healthier lifestyle, thereby drastically reducing the costs incurred on society.  In conclusion, while it may look like the BMIs of very muscular athletic people poses a problem with using the BMI, a closer examination of the relevant facts reveals that this is not a major problem. Rather, it are obese people whose BMIs do actually reflect their miserable physical state (and also people with a normal weight who eat an unhealthy diet) who are making everyone pay a hefty fat tax, and they are making the quality of the health care available for you a lot worse. Bureaucratic problems with athletic people having high BMIs are trivial to fix, unfair as such problems may look like, let's not forget that at age 80 you are not eligible for a heart transplant, no matter how well your medical prognosis is. How unfair is that?	2017-03-01 00:32:46Z	Count Iblis	1

One of the problems with BMI is that muscle weighs more than fat, so athletes (specially the ones that practise sports that rely on strength)  tends to break the BMI meaning.

Sarin however is much less stable due to the phosphorus-fluorine bond being easily broken by water or basic/nucleophilic materials.  The products of this hydrolysis are relatively non-toxic phosphonic acids.  Not all of the VX hydrolysis products appear to be fully non-toxic, which likely adds to it's designation as "deadliest". Additionally, there's the measured LD50 of the two, with Sarin being 172 μg/kg (rat, intravenous) and VX being  .  I don't know the exact chemical reasons for this, but one could assume the differences in structure lead to different and possibly more efficient binding affinity for VX or some other "advantageous" feature that makes it so deadly. And finally, the two agents have different levels of volatility.  Sarin is much more volatile, and so can be "cleared" much more easily.  VX is likely to stick around in contaminated materials since it doesn't evaporate out of them as easily, and this could arguably make it more "deadly" over time.	2017-02-27 20:10:17Z	Zintlions	4

You may release the feel good ones when the stress has passed, depending on the type of stress (horrible daily grind of an awful job versus the stress of being chased by a hungry bear & getting away).  Most stress people feel in the modern developed world is more of a long term nagging sort, versus the survival level sort.  That is also long & drawn out in such a cases, versus excitement, which in intense feeling, is generally rather brief.  You don't typically sustain the anxious level excitement that impacts eating, sleeping, etc longer term.  You can experience all those for a fair amount of time though when in love.

What era was this written? As far as I know, today, we can practically stitch up all shapes of wounds as long as the skin edges are opposable. So whether it's a straight incised wound, a round puncture wound, a triangular wound, stellate wound, or a wound with jagged edges, it is   possible to stitch them up. Sometimes, if the wound edges are jagged or serrated and won't oppose neatly, the surgeons can just trim off the edges to make them straight and allow for better opposition. If the edges are stellate, or maybe triangular, a purse string suture can be done, much like this picture: (I guess this is what you're looking for). The skin of the human body is a bit loose and usually allows for some stretching. So sometimes, even if there's a considerable gap between the skin, it's still possible to close them up. The skin can be undermined (or released from the underlying tissues) so that it can be stretched further towards the center of the gap.  And even if the gap is too big that the available skin won't allow for it to be closed, it's still possible to close them in time. There are many ways to do this. For example, you can just cover it first with artifical skin and wait for the patient's skin to grow on its own towards the center; or you can close it with a transplanted skin from another site of the body; and so on... So the plausibility of closure is not really a miracle in the scenario of a triangular wound. What I'm curious about this quote is the mention of bleeding because of the bayonet wound. I did some Google search because I was curious as to how a triangular-shaped wound would cause more bleeding compared to a regular stab wound.

11268	15218	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15218	Triangular blades were created for pretty much one reason, and one reason only. The triangular cross section made a stronger blade, ensuring more damage was done in a charge/stab versus a flat blade. The triangular blade was introduced in the early 1700's, mostly due to strength reasons. A triangular blade is less likely to bend/break when stabbing in a charge, especially if you hit a piece of armor, another weapon or bone. The cross section is much stronger in a triangle versus a flat blade. There is anecdotal evidence galore about the wound, and   that it is harder to heal, as the scar tissue filling in the wound tends to pull apart the rest of the wound as it heals. I can find several anecdotal references, but nothing concrete to confirm this. There is also anecdotal evidence that the Geneva Convention bans triangular blades, however the language only states "weapons that cause unneeded suffering" (paraphrased).  Pretty much the only reason for them was strength, and as other weapons became better, the bayonet went back to a single/double blade, as they are much more useful in that shape in non combat situations (Cutting ropes, food, straps, etc).	2018-02-05 14:54:57Z	JohnP	1

And it references this listing at   supporting this thinking. So it's neither based upon the fact the cold can help you catch the virus, as your mom suggests, nor the feelings during the cold.  Instead, it was an archaic belief that the cold made the disease itself.

11243	11264	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11264	First you have to consider how diseases are transmitted. STDs are usually skin to skin or warm body fluid to an open sore. Diseases like influenza, ebola, etc can't go through your skin. They require you to touch your eyes, mouth, or an open sore. Even getting a few drops of urine on your legs probably won't get you sick unless you move some of it to a wound, eyes, or mouth. This is why washing your hands is extremely important when using the restroom.   Assuming that the bathroom has regular maintenance and cleaning, the top of the toilet seat is likely one of the cleanest surfaces in the restroom most of the time. The cold hard surface of the toilet seat isn't ideal for any type of disease. Viral and bacterial levels decline very quickly on such surfaces. As long as it is visibly clean there is little to no chance of catching a disease from it. And a disinfecting wipe would reduce the dangers from mild to zero. I'm actually surprised wipes aren't offered in public restrooms. Stores often offer wipes for the shopping cart, but not in the bathrooms for the toilet. Here is the fun part:
In studies it is actually the handles of the bathroom stall door and sink that are the dirtiest because they are touched after you use the toilet and before you wash your hands. Secondly many toilets have a violent enough flush to launch a spray of fine mist into the air that no one notices. There is a small chance that could give the flu to people in neighboring stalls. But the person whom uses the toilet five minutes later probably won't have any problems as long as they wash their hands.  Don't worry about STDs. They usually aren't infectious enough or won't survive on cold hard surfaces. Many require skin to skin contact that a toilet doesn't provide. It is usually the more mundane diseases such as influenza or the common cold that are transmitted everywhere that are caught in the restroom.  Truthfully you are more likely to catch something from the shopping cart that you didn't wipe down, than you are the restroom in the same store. That surface is less likely to be clean than the sink in the restroom.  Some reading for the people whom want articles:

Several BMR equations exist but the most notable one was the   (revised 1984), which was created in 1919 and was the 'best' until 1990 until  . These equations use the same factors: When investigation on the BRM of a pool of individuals was done there was a wide range of results for people who appeared to be similar. They realised these because formulas are based on body weight alone, which does not take into account the difference in metabolic activity between lean body mass and body fat they were getting variation in their results.  Below is a further breakdown of the BMR impact per-pound of different types of tissue.    One can conclude for 2 individuals of the same weight, and different BMR's that it is likely that their muscle/fat ratio is not equal. An important point to note is that in all research all muscle mass is treated equally, biology dictates that muscle only has size and the ability for that muscle to be fully recruited to move weight is down to the adaptions that the muscle has gone through. Body builders utilise the principles of time-unter-tension to increase volume and to achieve this they often do not train for maximal lifts. The opposite is true for powerlifters and to a greater extent, strongmen who to train their bodies to perform maximal lifts and thus are 'stronger'. The quote from elite fitness is just looking from a maximal lift percentage. If they looked at total power output they might see that bodybuilders have a higher total. What 'burns fat faster'? Neither, muscle is muscle.	2017-02-21 12:27:40Z	JJosaur	1

It means that if you want to diagnose PCOS, the complaints (less frequent cycles, acne etc.) are not sufficient - you have to prove both the anatomical component (usually with ultrasound to describe the cysts) and the functional component (less frequent menstrual periods, androgen excess as measured by testosterone or similar hormones in the blood) of the disease. In addition to this, the physician can order other tests to exclude other pathologies with similar presentation. 
About your case, probably the physician that diagnosed PCOS was convinced by the ultrasound exam (he/she saw the cysts) and by your complaints. Maybe you do not remember, but often physicians in these situations order lab tests for hormones (FSH, LH, testosterone, insulin, blood sugar etc.), so check around for any laboratory findings in your medical documentation. 	2017-02-20 13:35:08Z	Cibr_D	3

I suffered from an ingrown toenail, but all doctors agreed that it was caused by not cutting my nails properly (I.e. I cut too much of my nail) and so the skin started to grow into my nail bed. You will have to see a doctor about this, and the two options I know of   are surgery or to put brackets on your toe to pull it out of the nail bed. This has nothing to do with eating habits. EDIT: 
Ingrown toenails are caused by skin being in the way of the nail. 
There are two ways this can happen: 
1. The skin is somewhere where it shouldn't be (i.e. growing into the nail bed if the nails has been cut too much)

11139	11236	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11236	 can be a result of many processes. In context of infectious diseases, the fever is triggered by substances released by the immune cells (substances such as interleukin-1 and -6). 
Also, pyrexia can be achieved by getting exogenous pyrogens, substances from the bacterial debris that can create the same response. Those substances then interact with one part of the brain that regulates the temperature. 
That part of the brain serves as a thermostat, meaning it sets the "default" body temperature higher in these states. By doing that, the body employs mechanisms to raise the temperature, which result with shaking of the muscles, increase in the metabolic rate, sweating etc. What is interesting is that often people with pyrexia or before the onset of pyrexia feel cold (the default temperature is set to higher point, so the organism feels the current temperature as low). 
The point of the fever in this context is not fully discovered, but there is evidence that it provides boost to the immune system production capabilities (increased production of cells to fight the infection etc.) and it might hamper the growth of some infectious organisms that are sensitive to temperature changes.      To be hyperconcise - fever implies immune system activation against antigen OR presence of exogenous pyrogens released from some bacteria (not all bacteria).     About failsafe mechanisms - the thermostat here is enough to coordinate between heat production and heat release. If the temperature goes above the "default", then the organism has many ways to release excess heat (sweating, inactivity, reducing of the metabolism etc.).

You need to consume as much water as you lose it. A young adult loses at least about 1 liter per day -- this is the obligatory water loss, which includes the loses by urinating, invisible perspiration and breathing, but not by sweating ( ). Practically everyone sweats at least a little , so everyone probably needs to drink more than 1 liter per day. Roughly speaking, a sedentary adult living in a temperate climate will usually need about 1.5-2 liters of water per day, including the water from beverages and foods (water, tea, milk, vegetables, fruits, cooked cereals). However, even in moderate climate, on a hot summer day, with few hours of a simple exercise like walking, you will probably sweat a lot, so you might need 4 to 5 liters or more water. Since it is not practical to measure the total water intakes and loses, you can just take care that you are well hydrated, which means you are not dehydrated or overhydrated. The main symptoms of dehydration are thirst, dry mouth, bright yellow or dark urine, increased heart rate and fatigue. When you drink more than you need, you will excrete the excessive water, so you will urinate frequently, probably more than 6 times per day.

If she had been fertile, it would have been 2 weeks after her last period, and adding 3 weeks gets you to 5 weeks, so this would be soon to be experiencing any of them. Things like feeling weak and sleeping a lot are not generally early symptoms. Spotting is also not a sign of pregnancy. It's more likely she's just worried, especially given the history of missing periods. There's no way to end a pregnancy (without the help of a doctor) that is both reliable and safe.

The skin around your nails also whitens in response to vitiligo; your nails might be deformed and pitted in the case of psoriasis.  Chronic kidney or liver disease can also manifest itself through your nails. Patients with severe cirrhosis or renal failure might notice the bottom half of their nails turn white, while the upper areas remain pink-to-clear. The most common cause is injury to the base of the nail (the matrix) where the nail is formed. It is harmless and most commonly caused by minor injuries, such as nail biting, that occur while the nail is growing. Leukonychia occurs most commonly in healthy individuals, unrelated to any known nutritional or physiological deficiency. When caused by injury the marks will disappear as the nail grows outwards, however a dietary deficiency will cause recurrent leukonychia. And as to what your mom said, it is slightly correct, certain deficiencies could cause this problem of nail color. Such as but  . It is simply a myth. Whatever the cause, white spots on fingernails are temporary and will grow out as your nails grow. However, it can take more than eight months for nails to grow out completely so the spots may be around for a while.	2017-02-06 07:20:00Z	Prince	2

It feels great.  You can also do it to your other ear afterwards. However, the best thing you can do, if your ears are clogged and need cleaning, is to see a doctor - a primary care doctor is just fine.  He or she can use a special equipment to inject water into your ear with very high pressure, and this releases all of the wax from your ears instantly.  It's worth it to go see a doctor - this process takes less than five minutes for a doctor to complete.	2017-02-06 02:42:53Z	Jenn	-1

11038	11108	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11108	Ibuprofen is a very-standard NSAID, and generally speaking it is a pretty safe drug when taken in an appropriate dose. All medications have side-effects, Ibuprofen is not the exception. Now, usually these things are not an issue for healthy individuals. Mostly they can be a problem for people with pre-existing conditions. Ibuprofen is not recommended for people with increased stroke or thrombotic risk (No NSAIDs are recommended for them, actually) but I don't think it is actually cardiotoxic. The potential of GI bleeding can actually be more of an issue as it is an effect directly related to the mechanism of action. Ibuprofen prevents the formation of Prostaglandins that a) Are responsible for inflammation but b) Are also responsible for secreting the protective layer of the gastric mucosa. Nonetheless, it's still generally safe if used in the proper doses and for few days at a time. (Usually, I don't recommend it over 5 days; when I do, I generally prescribe a proton-pump inhibitor also). Note that this risk is further increased if the patient is on corticosteroids. Ibuprofen can also be harmful for the kidneys (it reduces blood flow to kidneys), so it is not recommended in people with kidney disease. And, this is rare but I've seen it happen, in some cases it can cause an interstitial nephritis that can be very bad, most commonly when abused for a very long time. As for turmeric... I've never read any actual evidence that it acts as an anti-inflammatory.	2017-02-09 20:26:50Z	Gregorio Litenstein	0

According to  , it is an important attachment for various muscles, tendons and ligaments—which makes it necessary for physicians and patients to pay special attention to these attachments when considering surgical removal of the coccyx. Additionally, it is also a part of the weight-bearing tripod structure which acts as a support for a sitting person. When a person sits leaning forward, the ischial tuberosities and inferior rami of the ischium take most of the weight, but as the sitting person leans backward, more weight is transferred to the coccyx.  It's not actually accurate for a child to be born with a tailbone appendage.   is a rare congenital anomaly with a prominent lesion from the lumbosacrococcygeal region. It is also often considered to be a cutaneous marker of underlying occult dysraphism. You are right again, there has been a report of a 9 - month old healthy male infant brought for consultation for a “tail like” structure in the lumbosacral area since birth.   No, it isn't. Spina bifida is a condition where the spine does not develop properly, leaving a gap in the spine. The spine consists of the spinal column, which is a solid structure made up of bones (called vertebral bodies) separated by discs of fibrous tissue.  Behind this is an enclosed space called the spinal canal, which contains the spinal cord. The spinal cord connects all the nerves in the body to the brain. The canal is surrounded by arches of bone attached to the backs of the vertebral bodies.  In cases of spina bifida, something goes wrong and the arches of bone do not fully close. Sometimes there is only a gap in the bony arch, but at other times the spinal cord is also involved and does not form properly either. The skin over the arch can also either be intact or have a gap as well. For more info on spina bifida, visit   site.	2017-02-04 07:02:28Z	Prince	4

This may not seem like much, but the fluctuations of tides and nighttime light levels have both been very important to life on Earth since it began. It is probable that our internal body rhythms are in some way related to the cycles of our Moon, but I do not know exactly how, nor how strong that relationship is. Menstrual cycles are sometimes approximately the same length as lunar cycles, but nowadays there is quite a bit of variation among women. I cannot describe a mechanism by which our Moon would control the female reproductive system, but it might have influenced its development far back in the evolutionary tree. So, as a tentative answer to your question (mostly conjecture), it is possible that human behavior is somehow related to lunar cycles, but I believe the link between the two was forged millions of years ago, and is probably quite weak by now.	2017-02-02 22:16:34Z	Sasha	-1

The risk is compounded if you are not wearing proper protective equipment, washing your hands after handling them and covering breaks in skin before handling.   is a list of the diseases you could end up with as well as a list of other fluids and how exposures can occur.  If you would like to learn more and be able to better assist your patients, you should take first aid classes. Also, if you think that you have a high likelihood of coming in contact with blood or other fluids, you should consider carrying a pair of disposable medical gloves and safety glasses in your vehicle (or backpack... Something that is often with you). If you live in an area that has fairly prompt ambulance response, you are much better off not trying to take the patients to the hospital. Instead, if it is safe to do so, try to redirect traffic around the patient so that they don't get hit again and try to keep bystanders a few feet back from the incident so that they do not get hit as well. Try to avoid completely stopping traffic as this can effect the emergency vehicle's ability to get to the scene.  Your safety on scene is your priority, if you have the equipment, training to do so and ability to not get hit in the process, you should attempt to provide care to the patients. If any of those factors is not possible, you are much better off trying to keep the patient calm, keep bystanders at a distance - if possible - and try to keep the patient(s) from getting hit again.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please feel free to ask questions if you need clarification. 	2017-02-02 14:37:09Z	L.B.	4

The highest amount was reported for eggplant containing 100ng/g of nicotine. In that letter this was translated into 10g of plant material needed for a consumer to ingest 1 µg of nicotine. These values were used because this level of exposure was deemed equivalent with the amount of nicotine obtained by a passive indoor smoker. An average cigarette contains around 10mg nicotine. (Take note of the different units of measurement.) That would mean an   of vegetable is needed to be eaten to approach the nicotine levels of just one cigarette for a smoker. Although this should have been clear from the start given the different magnitudes this letter provoked quite some reactions: To which the original author responded: Many plants, only especially those of the nightshade family, contain chemicals that are classified as active drugs; like nicotine. But tobacco is specifically breed for nicotine content and cigarettes are standardised for its content. Unless one employs very sophisticated concentration and purification methods (or plays the long game in breeding those plants for nicotine content) the concentrations of nicotine are much too low as to be of any concern (or value, depending on perspective).	2017-10-23 12:26:46Z	LangLangC	2

You burn calories even when you do not exercise, because your body needs calories to maintain vital functions of the heart, kidneys, brain, to digest food, produce heat, etc. So, even if you lie in bed all day and consume less calories than you burn, you will lose weight. If you, as a sedentary adult, burn, for example, about 2,000 Calories per day, you need to consume less than this, let's say 1,500 Cal per day and you will lose weight, exercising or not. How do you know how many calories do you burn? If you consume a certain amount of calories and your body weight remains stable for several weeks, you know that you consume about as much calories as you burn. So, you can count how many you consume and you will know. To lose weight, it seems reasonable to consume about 500 Calories less per day than you consume.

10905	10931	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10931	: When treating cardiac insufficiency the key focus is increasing stroke volume. To do this we don't just decrease afterload but we also lower preload and sometimes increase contractility. So cardiac insufficiency is all about cardiac output (CO) and CO = stroke volume(SV)* heart rate (HR). The key problem in cardiac insufficiency is the lowered stroke volume, i.e. the amount of blood that is ejected from the heart on each heartbeat. HR can sometimes be relevant but let's focus on the SV for now. SV is mostly dictated by three factors afterload, preload and contractility. The Frank-Starling mechanism regulates the relationship between these factors.  There is an inverse relationship between afterload, the pressure the left ventricle has to overcome to eject blood, and stroke volume that is represented by the force/tension curve. So in the setting of cardiac insufficiency and high blood pressure the lowering of afterload is key. There is however a more complex relationship between preload and stroke volume. Stroke volume increases with increased preload up until a certain threshold where the preload pulls the sarcomeres of the cardiac muscles to wide. At this point increased preload decreases the stroke volume even further. This is sometimes referred to as the Starling mechanism (see fig 1). In the setting of fluid overload as we see in cardiac insufficiency blood backs up in the pulmonary blood stream leading to increased preload to the point where it is so high as to decrease the stroke volume. This is where decreasing preload is helpful in increasing stroke volume.  The Starling mechanism (note that Ventricular end-diastolic volume is The relationship between preload and stroke volume is even further determined by the hearts contractility. An increased contractility leads to a greater increase in stroke volume with each unit of preload (see fig 2). In cardiac insufficiency contractility is usually decreased leading to lower stroke volume in relation to preload. Sometimes, especially in a critical care environment contractility is increased by giving inotropic medication.  (LV EDP: Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (i.e. preload)) So when we treat cardiac insufficiency we can manipulate all those factors to alleviate the key problem of a low stroke volume.	2017-01-24 22:31:01Z	Sæmundur Rögnvaldsson	1

10898	10908	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10908	From this answer on Biology.SE (given and researched by me): Yes, this is possible through something called heteropaternal superfecundation (see below for further explanation). Of all twin births, 30% are identical and 70% are non-identical (fraternal) twins. Identical twins result when a zygote (one egg, or ovum, fertilized by one sperm) splits at an early stage to become twins. Because the genetic material is essentially the same, they resemble each other closely. Typically during ovulation only one ovum is released to be fertilized by one sperm. However, sometimes a woman's ovaries release two ova. Each must be fertilized by a separate sperm cell. If she has intercourse with two different men, the two ova can be fertilized by sperm from different sexual partners. The term for this event is   (HS): twins who have the same mother, but two different fathers. This has been proven in   (in which there will be a bias selecting for possible infidelity) involving fraternal twins, where genetic testing must be done on each child.

If that is the case, you will need a combination of layers ranging from heavy to light nuclei. That is, you want the material with the highest atomic number on the inside of the shield, and the material with the lowest atomic number on the outside. This would probably be quite heavy, which I presume is why you are interested in materials with interesting structures, like graphene. However, I have little experience with portable radiation shields, my background being in physics. I would recommend caution when forming the shape of any wearable EM shield. You could unwittingly create a resonant chamber, which would amplify the signal(s) with which it resonates. For example, the average hat would make a decent RF-chamber, so you should look at ways to shape your head shield to prevent RF resonance. All of the things you listed as things you want to shield from are electromagnetic waves with various frequencies. You should direct your research to the general theories behind electromagnetic shielding. I believe this will clear up a lot of your confusion about the best practices behind EM shielding.	2017-01-20 02:08:29Z	Sasha	1
10870	11315	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11315	After researching alot into EMR shielding, it seems the answer is twofold; for very low frequency Iron or Steel works fine,for higher end of low frequency Mu-Metal or Nickel filaments/sheets, or Graphite and even carbon will do. I did not find their maximum Ghz,but from the first study linked in the original question, ferromagnetics could reach probably a few ghz and maybe more,but with strong magnetic field they would be useless. Although Ferromagnetic work they are limited to low frequencies, if the frequency is high enough it will just pass the shield,it will also conduct the waves making the problem worse.  And I've been told(did not confirm yet) that they could not shield magnetic near fields. The thing that really repulse the magnetic field are Superconductors that work via Meissner effect. So far the best I've found are Graphene Superconductor( can be homemade from graphite),and also Graphite or Pyrolytic Carbon can work,there does not seem to be an other material. This covers the magnetic shielding, but probably needs to shield the electric aspect of the wave aswell, so a dielectric compound must be added to the shield or perhaps just electricity absorber with a insulator material. And for carbon materials, either plain or modified Graphite/Graphene could be better than anything else,considering a Graphene Superconductor would provide both natural shielding effect coupled with the Meissner effect.	2017-02-25 23:40:49Z	HerbalResearcher	-3

It is the case for most popular plant food that the omega-3 content is mostly made up of ALA. The temperature when steaming or boiling will be around 100 degrees Celsius, which is the boiling temperature of water. The boiling point of ALA is around 230 degrees Celsius [1] , and so the ALA will not boil out if you steam or boil vegetables in water. You might, however, be more interested in whether to fatty acids change in some other way due to the temperature. The primary concern would be the oxidation of the fatty acids. I did found one study [2], referenced from the Wikipedia page about ALA, which states that ALA remains stable during cooking. Note that if you are using a pressure cooker, the temperature may get higher; up to ~120 degrees Celsius. The ALA will still not boil out, but I am not sure how this will affect oxidation. To summarize, if you are boiling or steaming kale/spinach, you can be quite confident that the omega-3 fatty acids will still be there after you finish cooking. : [1] Pubchem. 2017.

Focus on the time you want to get up, not on bedtime. So, just get up at the time you want to get up regardless of how much sleep I got. The more physically fit you are, the less you'll be bothered by the lack of sleep for a few days. Also, by sticking to your exercise routine when changing your biorhythm (you may need to reduce the intensity and duration of exercise if you sleep less than 5 to 6 hours), you'll fall asleep at the right time. The fitter you are, the more the effects of the lack of sleep will be confined to cognitive functions, you'll still have plenty of energy to exert yourself physically. E.g. today I had to get up 2 hours earlier than usual, I went to bed one hour earlier, but I stayed awake for half an hour longer than usual. Nevertheless I got up at the right time and I didn't skip my exercise of one hour fast running. Now, before I started to run I felt like dozing off, so it would have been very tempting for me to skip today's exercise, but had I done that that might have affected the sleep I'm about to get in an hour from now.	2017-01-19 08:18:50Z	Count Iblis	0

When you have gallstones in the gallbladder you can have additional ones in the ducts. Theoretically, it is possible that a surgeon removes the gallbladder with stones, but some stone remains hidden in the ducts. Ultrasound should detect this. At next ultrasound, you can ask a doctor if any gallstones are mentioned in your medical documentation. If they find a gallstone in a common bile duct, they can remove it by a type of upper endoscopy called  . Another quite common cause of the gallbladder-like pain after gallbladder removal is   or more specifically   which can be due to a spasm of the muscular sphincter at the end of the common bile duct (where it opens into the duodenum).

10815	10816	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10816	People are more complicated than machines. First, imagine a condition like "high blood pressure" or "underactive thyroid." It's not just a case of measuring one number about you and comparing it to one "correct" number. There is a normal   for healthy people. Imagine some measurement that for normal people is between 10 and 12. Imagine that you genuinely have a shortfall in this number; and you vary between 8 and 10. One doctor sees you on the day you measure 10 and tells you that you're fine. Another doctor sees you on the day you measure 8 and tells you there is a shortfall. So that's one explanation. But life is actually more complicated than that. Some doctors might think 9-13 is actually normal for that number, so if you measure 9 they'll say you're fine. Others might think that it depends on some other reading, so if you measure 10 but the other number is low, they'll say you're ill, while another will insist that a reading of 10 means you're fine.  And doctors vary on how urgent they think certain conditions are: some think they can advise you to change your diet or to exercise, while others want to start you on medications, even when they both agree you have a particular condition. Then on top of all of that there's the matter of how the doctors get paid. Some want to recommend particular treatments or tests as much to ensure an income for themselves as to actually fix you. We of course all hope that such people are few and far between, but they do exist, and you may have met a few of them in your time, or your relatives may have. How should you behave? You have two choices. One is to focus on your symptoms: you're tired, or your eye hurts, or whatever, and ask your doctor to help you learn why and help you fix that so you feel better. If they do a measurement and say that it's fine, you ask them to do some other measurement or test so that they can suggest things to do that will help with your symptom. The other approach is to learn more about the condition you think you may have. Say you think you have high blood pressure. Learn what a normal range for each number is. When your doctor measures yours, ask what the measurement was. Learn the things you can do - how you sit, for example, that can affect the measurement. Ask the doctor's conclusion about the measurement - is it high? is it fine? - and if your conclusion is different, ask why. Why is that high? Don't people normally vary between x and y over the course of a day? Or why is that fine? Learn some of the thought processes your doctor is going through. Getting a second opinion is a fine strategy. But "Dr A says I need a medication and Dr B says I do not" is nowhere near as valuable as "Dr A measured 8 and says normal is 10-12 so I need this medication to raise it, but Dr B measured 10 and says normal is 9-13 so I don't."  You can now go and learn more about what a normal range is, the consequences of being low, the side effects of the medication, and so on, then make an informed decision, including which doctor you want to work with over time to maintain your health. 	2017-01-14 22:24:51Z	Kate Gregory	1

The reason for this is that by eating before, you then have to tote around that much more mass, which requires slightly more calories to perform the same exact task. This is one of the reasons why people on a diet eventually reach some stable weight; eventually the fewer calories they are eating reaches the amount they need to fuel their activity at their reduced weight (mass). Put another way, lighter people need fewer calories just to go about their day-to-day activities than more massive individuals. Will this make a real difference over the course of, say, a year? I very much doubt it; the difference would be completely overwhelmed by variations in daily activity and food consumption. That being said, if two individuals were tracked over the course of a year with their activity and food consumption completely regulated, the one eating before exercise would lose slightly more weight than the one eating afterward. There are charts showing calorie requirements, weight, and physical activity  . One could probably calculate the difference, but I'm too lazy (and pressed for time) to actually do so.

The common conception is that a calorie is a calorie and there shouldn't be a difference in weight gain if you just change meal time and all other variables are left equal.  As for meal time in relation to exercise, there also does not seem to be a consensus about whether it is better to eat before exercise or not. The argument seems to mostly revolve around whether it is good to exercise first thing in the morning, before eating, which means a fasting state where glycogen stores are low. Given that you exercise in the afternoon, it does not seem as relevant to you, as if you ate a good breakfast your glycogen stores would likely be restored in any case.

Secondly, I will explain why clinicians rarely do that for respiratory infections. To test for bacteria, a sample can be taken of the body tissue/fluid that is infected - blood for bacteremia, urine for bladder/kidney infection, pus for abscess, spinal fluid for meningitis, sputum for respiratory infection, etc. Usually, soon after taking the sample, treatment is started with " ," rather than waiting for test results while the infection grows.  This is called "Empiric Therapy." Then, when results come back, the antibiotic choice can be "narrowed" in to target the likely bacteria. Commonly, the first test to come back is the Gram Stain, which can be minutes to hours.  For example, "gram positive cocci" highly suggests Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. In this case, we could narrow the antibiotic spectrum to something that kills those types of bacteria. Then, 24-72 hours later is usually the earliest that culture results are available.  For example, it would tell us (1) Staphylococcus aureus and (2) Resistant to Methicillin but Sensitive to Vancomycin, Clindamycin... (other representative antibiotics).  That would define this bacteria as Methicillin-Resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA).  Then we could further narrow the antibiotic to Vancomycin, Clindamycin, etc depending on what kind of infection it is and a bunch of other factors. However: The  . The bacteria in the phlegm from your lungs will show up in a gram stain or culture, but so will a lot of the bacteria from your mouth.  How then would you know which is causing the infection?

In the case of sleep, Magnesium is  the primary ingredient in muscle relaxation, has a neuroprotective effect that is absolutely crucial to each and every stage of sleep, assists in slowing metabolic processes and lowering brain temperature as your body attempts to repair daily damage during sleep cycles, and helps regulate key hormones responsible for not only helping you fall asleep, but keeping you asleep. A   published in the Journal of American Geriatrics Society was able to investigate the benefits of the combination of zinc, melatonin and magnesium in the treatment of insomnia in elderly people.

During the first month we can only discern vague shapes and shadows beyond much more than a foot or so, though some color development takes place during that time. (References   and  .) I won't go into anymore detail; the point being that the brain of a person who is born blind would never learn how to process images. And without having that experience, they would not have context in which to place those images into a dream. I think it would be reasonable to conclude that a person blind since birth could only dream in the context of their own experiences (i.e. a non-sighted world). Similarly, a color blind (or more accurately color deficient) person could not dream in any colors they have no experience with. For example, if someone couldn't see green, then they could not see that or yellow (yellow being a combination of red and green). Since they have no experience with those colors (i.e. they have no idea what they look like), they could not have dreams with those colors in them.	2017-01-11 00:40:21Z	BillDOe	4

Do you think you'd be able to successfully differentiate between a melanoma and a benign "suspicious skin spot" every single time? Now consider that melanoma is just one of many different types of skin cancer, and that skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer. One particular advantage we have in fighting this type of cancer is that it often comes with a warning sign, the "suspicious skin spots" you mention. And this is extraordinarily important in successfully fighting the disease. In 2014, 46% of skin cancer patients in England were diagnosed in stages III or IV, which often means death for the patients. One of the single most crucial factors in whether or not a cancer patient will outlive the cancer is early diagnosis. The suggestion of just removing suspicious skin spots as you notice them is thus enormously dangerous, because by the time you notice the spot, you could already have metastatic cancer. Indeed, 52% of non-Hispanic black patients and 26% of Hispanic patients receive an initial diagnosis of advanced stage melanoma, as do 16% of non-Hispanic white patients. Note that it is unclear from the source whether this statistic applies specifically within the general population of the US, the general population of the world, or what have you. In a type of cancers so common that an anticipated one in five US residents will get some form of skin cancer at some point in his or her life,  wouldn't you agree that any step that can improve survival rate as drastically as having a doctor check your suspicious skin spot is most decidedly a step well worth taking?	2017-01-10 10:25:02Z	TheEnvironmentalist	1
10755	10758	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10758	In  , Daniel Defoe writes of a febrile patient who cures himself of the plague by swimming in a river: Defoe's work is fictional, but presumably it is based on real anecdotes. I'm still trying to track down references, but I also recall reading about indigenous tribes treating cases of the 1918 "Spanish flu" by submerging the sufferer up to his neck in a river. The cases were described in two separate books, one discussing South African responses to the pandemic, the other, those of New Zealand. I recall that in both cases the practice was condemned by colonial medical authorities. (For a South African reference, see Howard Phillips, "Black October", p. 170)  is an account by an army doctor who was one of the first victims of the "Hong Kong" flu of 1968, who caught it from a returning Vietnam veteran. There is no mention of an ice  , but he says that the staff who treated him ran out of ice and had to request more from local restaurants. I am not an expert, but I believe that Western medicine currently teaches that fevers have an adaptive purpose and should be allowed to "run their course", while Traditional Chinese Medicine acknowledges this but also identifies a category of illnesses where the high temperatures are harmful to the patient and should be treated with cooling medicines. In other words, the more nuanced view is that most or all contagious diseases may involve some kind of fever as part of the body's immune response, which is usually beneficial, except in cases of "high fever" where it is harmful. According to this theory, using an ice bath would be beneficial in certain types of fever. For a historical background, the "Father of English Medicine" Thomas Sydenham is associated with early advocacy of the use of "cooling medicines" such as cowslips and laudanum, as well as bleeding, in the cure of fevers. I have spoken with modern ER doctors who will administer morphine, which lowers the body temperature, in the case of a high fever; and I have spoken with other ER doctors who have never heard of this practice but will prescribe ibuprofen to lower the body temperature. The practice of Sydenham's contemporaries was to treat fevers with stimulants, which Sydenham himself condemns. He writes (p. 149): Prescribing a cold bath in certain cases seems consistent with Sydenham's views, but I wasn't able to find any place where he actually advocates doing so. One should note that Sydenham also warns that interfering with the course of a fever will tend to prolong it (p. 111) ("despumation" means "the act of discharging impurities from the body fluids"):	2017-01-09 17:55:50Z	Metamorphic	3

At very least go to an urgent care or a pharmacy and have it double checked. To answer the original question, blood pressure and pulse are not directly related.  The body regulates both separately to respond to environmental and internal conditions, but there is no direct 1:1 correlation. Pulse is how often the heart squeezes; pressure is how hard it squeezes, though technically that's the systolic pressure; and, in the case of diastolic (the lower number) pressure, it's how well or poorly the heart relaxes after squeezing).  A pressure of 188/134 would be severely hypertensive with likely diastolic heart failure;   A number like that, though, to me, screams poor equipment or poor technique, which is most likely the case if you are not being professionally tested and especially if you are improperly using a home testing system.	2017-01-07 20:01:04Z	quietmedic	3

Strength exercise are also recommended for good health, having strong muscles brings additional health benefits. But you cannot replace the benefits of cardio exercise by doing only only bodybuilding. By burning a lot of energy (many hundreds of Kcal a day) you can eat a lot more without gaining weight, but what is then important is that you then eat a lot more healthy foods based on whole grains, brown rice and vegetables. Your intake of fibers will then be a lot larger. Fibers get converted to short-chained fatty acids (SCFA) by intestinal bacteria, and these SCFA are known to have important roles in preventing heart disease, certain cancers and diabetes. Now, when reading information about diabetes on the Internet, you need to keep in mind that the information you find is aimed at people who are lot older than you, who may already be coping with a lot of health problems, who reasonably would not be able to attain a fitness goal anywhere near to what you can attain. They have to focus a lot more on calorie restriction to lose weight. This is not recommended for young people who are healthy and who have a healthy weight, because this would make it more difficult for you to exercise, you'll feel tired and you won't recuperate as well. 	2017-01-08 00:40:49Z	Count Iblis	1

E.g. we're the only animals that walk upright, we're the only animals that cook food, etc. etc. Now, there is something to be said about dairy products not being the ideal source of calcium and protein due to containing saturated fats. But they are rich in protein and minerals like calcium. If we leave out dairy products from the diet, then it seems to be quite difficult to get to the RDA of calcium. But here we must take into account another difference between humans and animals;  humans are sedentary animals whose typical fitness level falls way short of the maximum fitness level they could achieve. Now, I do exercise a lot, I eat close to 4000 Kcal a day, and I do get a lot of calcium from sources that would be irrelevant for most other people. These sources are: So, an a typical day I can easily get to (210 + 150 + 235 + 120) mg = 715 mg of calcium (the RDA is about 1 gram) from sources most people wouldn't even count because "they hardly contain any calcium". Now, I do also eat cheese, yogurt and other dairy products. Just two slices of cheese contains 600 mg of calcium.  Most people eat only half the calories I eat, this would bring down the amount of calcium they could typically get to about 360 mg. However, most people also tend to get a smaller fraction of their calories from whole grains, and more from fat. Instead of eating a sandwich with meat, they eat meat with a sandwich like this: Then you can forget about getting even that 360 mg of calcium from non-dairy sources. A few hundred mg of calcium is all most people can count on from getting from non-dairy sources, therefore they can't do without dairy products.	2017-01-02 23:10:59Z	Count Iblis	1

This means that dieting alone is likely to cause problems with your energy levels, making it difficult to then start exercising. Given that you're not used to doing exercise, it's best to start first with exercise. Once you get used to exercising and are making fitness gains, you can start with reducing calorie intake to lose weight faster. People who carry large excess fat reserves, say someone who is 50 kg overweight, will be able to drastically reduce their calorie intake and still be able to exercise hard, because they can burn fat at a much higher rate. The problem is that a lot of the weight loss programs are adapted to these people, but it's not going to work well for people who only need to lose 10 kg or less weight. The sort of exercise you need to do is cardio exercise, like biking, running or swimming. You can burn hundreds of calories in a half an hour session, the fitter you become, the faster and longer you can do this, burning more and more energy. Strength exercises like weightlifting are not so useful for burning energy, but they are still good exercises for your overall health. You should change your diet immediately toward eating more vegetables, fruits and whole grains. You should make sure you eat enough in the beginning, so that you don't feel hungry. This is to make sure your exercise program starts well. The level you're exercising at is then determined by your present fitness, if you were to start restricting calorie intake immediately, you would under-perform relative to your present fitness. It would then be difficult to increase your fitness.  After a few months, if you feel that your weight is not coming down fast enough, you can start to restrict your calorie intake. Since by that time you're used to sticking to an exercise routine, you can do this safely without that affecting your exercise performance. 	2017-01-02 22:28:21Z	Count Iblis	0

10672	10774	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10774	There are a few terms to define here, and I'll go through them one by one: This has to do with the type of scan. MRI's are pretty complicated technologically, but the basic idea is that body tissues are full of water, and water molecules respond to magnets. If you turn on a really powerful magnet near body tissues, the water molecules in the tissues will align with the magnetic field. Turn off the magnet and pulse a radio signal, and you'll shake the molecules back into a random alignment and they'll shoot back a radio signal as they move. This is called  . If you can detect all the little radio signals coming back from all the molecules and figure out where they all came from, you can map out where all the water molecules are, which tells you where the tissues are. Do it precisely enough, and you can make a high-quality image of whatever tissue you're scanning. This is  , or MRI. The problem is, like with a camera, you only get an image of one side. If you want everything in 3D, you need to repeat this again and again from a bunch of different angles. That's what you're hearing when the MRI machine goes bang, bang, bang, bang, bang... — the machine is getting the image again and again from every possible angle. It's also repeating images on each location for more information. There are a few variables you can tinker with to tune the image to what you're looking for, most notably repetition time (TR), how long you wait between each pulse, and time to echo (TE), how long between the radio pulse being sent and the echo being captured. If you set the machine to wait a very short time between pulses (short TR), and a very short time between sending each radio pulse and capturing its result (short TE), you're going to get what's called a T1-weighted image. Much longer TR and TE produce a different image, called a T2-weighted image. Even longer, and you get a FLAIR image. These are just names for the different types of scans you can get by playing with TR and TE, but the rationale for what makes an image T1- or T2- weighted is based on properties of the water molecules themselves, literally quantum physics. You're welcome to look them up though if you like, and get a really good understanding of exactly what makes the image look that way. Intensity on an MRI refers to the brightness of a given spot. But because doctors are doctors, instead of calling it a spot, they refer to a given location on the MRI as a "focus." This term tends to be reserved for when something special is going on there. To go a bit deeper into intensity, a   is a spot that's brighter than you'd expect it to be, and a   is a spot that's darker than you'd expect it to be. In a T2-weighted MRI specifically, watery tissues shine brightest, meaning that a hyperintensity — or hyperintense focus — in a T2 MRI is a particularly watery area, often something unusual. But exactly what it means depends on where the hyperintensity is. Your brain is divided into two basic types of material, white matter and gray matter. Broadly speaking, the gray matter forms the outermost surface of the brain, the cerebral cortex, which is in charge of most of the actual thinking that takes place in your brain, like getting input from your senses, sending output to your muscles, and connecting the two with, well, your consciousness and most human mental abilities. White matter on the other hand is like all of the wires that connect the gray matter together, and sits below the surface of the brain. Structurally, you can think of the white matter as the "body" of the brain and the gray matter as the "skin," even though the gray matter does just about all of the actual thinking. There are really three important sections of the brain when it comes to hyperintensities: the periventricular white matter, the deep white matter, and the subcortical white matter. The subcortical white matter is just a little bit deeper than the gray matter of the cerebral cortex. The deep white matter is even deeper than that, going towards the center of the brain, the ventricles. The periventricular ("near the ventricles") white matter is right along the ventricles at the innermost parts of the brain. The cerebrum, the largest part of the brain, is divided into four lobes from back to front and bottom to top: the occipital lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe. If you only look at the gyri, or outer folds of the brain, you end up with the colored areas below: The frontal lobe is then divided into a number of sections, the main three of which are the superior, middle and inferior gyri, labeled above as  ,   and  . The middle section, the middle frontal gyrus, is what we're looking for. Because the brain is split into left and right halves, we end up with two middle frontal gyri, the left one and the right one, shown below.
 
This is the brain of a guy facing you from the front, looking slightly to your right. The part of his brain you're seeing would be just under the forehead. The red sections are the left and right middle frontal gyri. Remember that these parts are labeled from the perspective of the guy whose brain it is, and not from the perspective of the observer. So the red spot to the left is his right middle frontal gyrus. Finally, what is a T2 hyperintense focus in the subcortical white matter of the right middle frontal gyrus? The T2 tells you that the image was made using a T2-weighted MRI scan. The hyperintense focus is a bright spot, likely caused by higher than expected water content. Remember that bright doesn't mean "compared to the rest of the scan," it means "compared to how that area is supposed to look." The subcortical white matter is just the white matter directly below the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain. The right middle frontal gyrus is the left red section in the image above. So all in all, it's a brighter than expected spot in the layer of white matter just below the outer surface of the brain, in the red section to the left above.	2017-01-10 13:56:50Z	TheEnvironmentalist	1

It is true that it is denaturated in the stomach, but this means only its secondary structure ("shape"), but not the chemical bonds, are changed. So, the cysteine from onions will be absorbed as proper cysteine. I'm not aware of any special health benefits of cysteine in otherwise healthy individuals, though.

Your doctor, obviously, made a biopsy, so he got a piece of that mass out of your pancreas and sent it to the pathologist. The pathologist described how the tissue looked   (by the naked eye): as a "piece of soft tissue." The pathologist also commented that the specimen was "suboptimal," because it contained only "connective tissue," which is less likely affected by cancer, so he/she can neither confirm nor exclude cancer. The text you have provided does not mention any cancer, but I'm not sure if you have written everything from the document you have. If you can't find any text after "Tiny fragment of connective tissue only (suboptimal)"...you can ask a doctor, if you need to wait for the further results or--in case all tests have been completed--what is your exact diagnosis.	2016-12-30 16:16:47Z	Jan	2

Yes, such things can happen. It's not exactly that you "spread" the cough, but you can--unintentionally-- "provoke" the person to cough.

The other person can find this scary or funny, but he/she is not able or does not want to tell you, so the tension builds up in his/her chest/throat resulting in an urge to cough.

Except for certain specialized professions e.g. in the medical field where you need to be sterile, you don't need to take showers except possibly for social reasons. Not taking showers, however, may yield health benefits. While not proven, there are biologically plausible arguments in favor of not taking showers. Let's start with the reason why most of us take showers. This is not because we're following medical guidelines to prevent certain illnesses, it's simply a matter of us not wanting other people to smell us from a large distance. This smell is caused by bacteria that grow in our sweat, they produce chemical compounds like   that have a strong smell. As   these smells have a biological function in animals. In our modern lifestyle, we have eliminated this flora on our skin and we're also less exposed to bacteria in our environment.   that we suffer from. As  :  Now, taking regular showers combined with and the general approach to hygiene in the Western world may be implicated in many other health problems. E.g., recently  . Now, this does not mean that taking regular showers will lead to some illness, but it's also not easy to rule this out. Someone who is healthy who gets some stomach bug for which antibiotics are prescribed may lose a lot of his intestinal microbes; the fact that he like almost everyone else takes regular showers and lives in a very clean environment may then predispose him to his gut flora to get populated by the wrong type of microbes which may cause problems down the line. So, while we can't say that taking regular showers has been proven to be harmful., the opposite that it's healthy can't be proven either, and from a  broader perspective there are far more reasonable, plausible arguments to suggest that you should not bet on it being good for you. The real question that should be addressed is how we can stop taking regular showers in a socially acceptable way, because the only reason why we take showers is for social reasons, not for health reasons.

The CDC lists the average age of menarche as about 13 years ( ) and menopause as 51 ( ). A 48 year old woman, if still having an active menstrual cycle, can get pregnant. However, there are risks of having a pregnancy at that age. Remember that all of the eggs that a woman has are present at birth. This means that a 48 year old woman has kept all of those eggs for her entire life, and that they have been exposed to all of the various stresses that people have over a lifetime. This can include the effects of medications, radiation exposure (which accumulates over time), and other considerations. As a result, the risk of birth defects increases with age of the woman. I strongly recommend consultation with a physician, including special consultation with a fertilization expert. Genetic counseling may also be of particular benefit to help you with family planning. Finally, I would also espouse getting a triple screen done should a successful pregnancy happen. This will help you to identify some potentially devastating genetic defects well before birth, thus giving you options for family planning.	2016-12-25 01:35:25Z	OverlordvI	2
10591	10594	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10594	The fact of the matter is, regardless of the consumption method, a calorie is a calorie. The energy it takes to burn one liquid calorie equals exactly the same as that needed to burn one solid calorie. What throws some people off is the concept of caloric density. Foods that have high water content tend to have lower caloric density (think fruits and veggies), meaning a greater calorie to volume ratio. For example, to consume the same amount of calories you would get from one cup of raisins, you would need to eat nearly ten cups of grapes. What adds to this is that low caloric density foods tend to make you feel fuller faster because of their water content. This does not mean that simply consuming more liquid will make you want to eat less. Liquid calories may in fact be deceiving because beverages like sodas often contain a lot of calories but do little to satiate hunger. When studies compared food intake between one group given water to drink and the other given soda, there was little difference in the amount of solid calories they ate. However, even though both groups ate roughly the same amount of food, the group who drank the soda consumed more calories overall because of the beverage that accompanied their meal.	2016-12-24 15:36:37Z	Prince	1

If worried, you can put on a small amount of an antibiotic cream or spray it. On the other hand, the more you pick it the more likely it will become infected.

There are several possible causes for insertional pain like you described. Women with these symptoms may have anatomical issues that make penetration painful and/or difficult (such as a thick hymen). If there are any lesions in the vaginal area, such as warts, sexually transmitted diseases, or (perhaps most likely here) unhealed areas from earlier intercourse, these all can definitely cause pain. Lastly, some women experience involuntary muscle spasms with penetration, which makes penetration VERY painful to her. This is often involuntary, and it isn't "just in your head", however it is most frequent in women with anxiety about sex, holding personal taboos or having an upbringing with strong social/cultural taboos against sex, or a history of physical or emotional trauma. Having that kind of history is not required though. Treatment involves psychotherapy and techniques to gradually help her relax those muscles (it does not happen overnight). As L.B. said, perhaps there are cuts there from earlier, in which the best thing may be to let them heal before irritating that area. Any of the other causes can definitely benefit from seeing a gynecologist, as doctors can help all of these issues. Sounds like sex has been stressful for you both!

It's not very soluble in water, however.  When you eat chilli peppers capsaicin is released to your saliva, which is basically water. And being such, the amount released is limited. However, if you leave chilli peppers in oil, capsaicin is massively released to the oil. The amount of capsaicin that your body will have the chance to take in (aka bioavailability) is much greater for chilli oil than for fresh peppers.

There have been hypotheses on various diets increasing the risk of MS, however, there is no strong scientific evidence that would confirm this. At best, the results from controlled studies were inconsistent.  There was a large prospective study on two cohorts of women (92,422 with 14 year follow-up and 95,389 with 4 years follow-up), which has shown: , many doctors do recommend a special diet when on glucocorticoid  therapy. Influence on electrolyte and sugar metabolism has been established with these medicines, as well as increased energy intake. The recommended diet is usually low in calories, fat and simple carbohydrates (no sugar I'm afraid or as little as possible), rich in protein; also low sodium and foods rich in potassium, calcium and vitamin D are recommended.  These nutritional strategies serve to prevent or mitigate potential metabolic side effects of corticosteroids. That being said, it is still a point of debate whether these are applied only in chronic systemic application of glucocorticoids or should they also be included in pulse therapy (short-term, high doses, the sort that you described). Ultimately, the recommendations on diet should come from your doctor, and you should ask as many questions as you wish. Sometimes this sort of news comes as a bit of a shock, and it is good to have a family member with you and to write down the recommendations - when there is a lot to process it is easy to forget a crucial piece of information.

When you are aware of what you need to do, you are able to better manage your workload. You will be able to get more (of the right tasks) done in less time.  – Being organized results in less rework and mistakes. Forgotten items, details, and instructions lead to extra work. How often do you have to do a task more than once? Or make an extra trip because you forget something?  – How often do you create your own problems? Whether it is a forgotten appointment or missed deadline, not managing your time results in increased life friction. Avoid creating your own problems by planning and preparing for your day.  – We can’t create more time, but you can make better use of it by managing your time. Even simple actions like shifting your commute or getting your work done early can produce more leisure time in your life.  – When you know what you need to do, you waste less time in idle activities. Instead of wondering what you should be doing next, you can already be a step ahead of your work.  – Being on top of your time and work produces more opportunities. The early bird always has more options. As well, luck favors the prepared.  – Your time management reputation will proceed you. At work and in life you will be known as reliable. No one is going to question whether you are going to show up, do what you say you are going to do, or meet that deadline.  – A common misconception is that time management takes extra effort. To the contrary, proper time management makes your life easier.

10451	10477	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10477	Here are some ways to tame those sugar cravings.  Eat a bit of what you’re craving, maybe a small cookie or a fun-size candy bar, suggests Kerry Neville, MS, RD, a registered dietitian and ADA spokeswoman. Enjoying a little of what you love can help you steer clear of feeling denied. Try to stick to a 150-calorie threshold, Neville says.  If the idea of stopping at a cookie or a baby candy bar seems impossible, you can still fill yourself up and satisfy a sugar craving, too. "I like combining the craving food with a healthful one," Neville says. "I love chocolate, for example, so sometimes I’ll dip a banana in chocolate sauce and that gives me what I’m craving, or I mix some almonds with chocolate chips." As a beneficial bonus, you'll satisfy a craving and get healthy nutrients from those good-for-you foods.  Cutting out all simple sugars works for some people, although "the initial 48 to 72 hours are tough," Gerbstadt says. Some people find that going cold turkey helps their cravings diminish after a few days; others find they may still crave sugar but over time are able to train their taste buds to be satisfied with less.  If you want to avoid giving in to a sugar craving completely, try chewing a stick of gum, says nutrition advisor Dave Grotto, RD, LDN. "Research has shown that chewing gum can reduce food cravings," Grotto says.
Reach for fruit. Keep fruit handy for when sugar cravings hit. You'll get fiber and nutrients along with some sweetness. And stock up on foods like nuts, seeds, and dried fruits, says certified addiction specialist Judy Chambers, LCSW, CAS. "Have them handy so you reach for them instead of reaching for the old [sugary] something."  When a sugar craving hits, walk away. "Take a walk around the block or [do] something to change the scenery," to take your mind off the food you’re craving, Neville suggests.  "If you need a sugar splurge, pick a wonderful, decadent sugary food," Moores says. But keep it small. For example, choose a perfect dark chocolate truffle instead of a king-sized candy bar, then "savor every bite -- slowly," Moores says. Grotto agrees. "Don’t swear off favorites -- you’ll only come back for greater portions. Learn to incorporate small amounts in the diet but concentrate on filling your stomach with less sugary and [healthier] options."  Waiting too long between meals may set you up to choose sugary, fatty foods that cut your hunger, Moores says. Instead, eating every three to five hours can help keep blood sugar stable and help you "avoid irrational eating behavior," Grotto says. Your best bets? "Choose protein, fiber-rich foods like whole grains and produce," Moores says. But won't eating more often mean overeating? Not if you follow Neville's advice to break up your meals. For instance, have part of your breakfast -- a slice of toast with peanut butter, perhaps -- and save some yogurt for a mid-morning snack. "Break up lunch the same way to help avoid a mid-afternoon slump," Neville says. Reference :  	2016-12-14 10:32:43Z	Lakshmi Balan	1
10451	10479	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10479	There are two aspects to feeling "addicted" to sugar Not everyone experiences the second, but many do. Your approaches to the situation depend on which thing you're trying to fix. For being used to a sweet taste, try a little while of not eating the things you expect to be sweet. No tea or coffee, no cereal, no toast, whatever. Then when you reintroduce the food, use half the sugar that you used to. If that sounds too unpleasant, try gradually reducing the amount of sugar you add over a few weeks. Switching to alternate sweeteners (whether "healthier" like honey or maple syrup, which might provide a few micronutrients as well as sweetness, or lower-calorie like Splenda, Stevia etc) isn't going to help this pattern of needing sweetness, so it's a poor solution. When you can't get diet ginger ale you'll just drink regular ginger ale because you patterns haven't changed so you don't like water. If you want to eat and drink fewer sweet things, do that, don't change where the sweetness comes from to make your old pattern ok. For the sugar rush/high followed by crash, things are different. Whenever you eat something sweet, be sure to eat some protein or fat at the same time or very shortly afterwards. This will mute the high a little and more importantly, prevent the crash. This was an issue for both my children and they learned how to get something other than pure sugar into their system quickly. So if you start your day with jam on toast, instead of two slices of that, have one of jam on toast and then one of peanut butter on toast. If you start your day with a bowl of fruit, how about putting some yogurt (ideally not zero fat yogurt) in there too? If you have a donut or cookies at 3pm, could you not also have a little cheese (brought from home, it won't spoil) or some almonds or peanuts (which will keep for weeks) as well? 	2016-12-14 12:54:14Z	Kate Gregory	1

This is usually caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure such as in a vaso-vagal syncope where a strong vagal response triggers sudden dilation of arteries (vasodilation) and decreases the heart rate. The same goes for heart conditions called arrhythmias cause an abnormal heartbeat (sometimes very slow or very fast) that leads to a drop in blood pressure. The response to this hypo-perfusion is a sudden loss of consciousness and muscle tone. This leads to collapse leaving the head/brain at the same level as the heart. This makes the return of venous blood from the lower body easier as it no longer travels against gravity and blood must no longer travel against gravity to the brain. This in turn makes the hearts job of perfusing the brain easier leading to a rapid recovery of consciousness. That's at least the rough concept. Here is an article about syncope, it's clinical symptoms, and physiology: 	2017-01-24 23:23:38Z	Sæmundur Rögnvaldsson	1

Controlling the airway, breathing, and circulation are the first priorities in these patients. With that said, there is not much published on PubMed that answers this question. However, I did find an article in Nursing Times that talks about some value in talking to patients - whether they are conscious or unconscious. This has been shown to improve survival in a very limited sample. However, I would caution using this as "evidence-based" literature and would always focus on the ABCs.

Imagine this. It's the middle of the night. You're in awful pain. Something horrible and unexpected has happened - a car accident, a crime, a house explosion - and you've seen awful things or you're worried about your loved ones on top of everything else. You don't want this to be real. You don't want to experience this. Going away, by zoning out, letting yourself fall asleep, co-operating with the pull you feel towards unconsciousness - that may seem like a good idea. A person telling you not to may actually keep you from letting go and going under, because some part of it is your choice whether to stay conscious or not, at least for some kinds of injury or trauma. As to why a care provider wants to keep you awake, it's generally so they can ask you things, or get you to help them treat you. This was my experience when a 3am gallbladder attack took me to the ER. It hurt so much and I was so tired and this nurse was all in my face, demanding I categorize my pain "on a scale of 1 to 10" which I find pointless since they never ask you what a 10 would be, and she wouldn't take no for an answer so I basically closed my eyes and wished she would go away, and I would have happily gone to sleep right there, or at my pain level you could have called it passing out from the pain. But she wouldn't let me. She was firm to the point of rudeness and she was demanding. Her position was "I need you to talk to me so I can help you." And in the end I did and she did.  The point is there is much use to the patient staying conscious - it lets you see if things are getting worse or better, lets you gather information, lets you ask them to roll over or sit up - and in at least some cases, asking (along perhaps with slapping as in the movies, shoulder-shaking, or at least physical contact like taking someone's chin and using it to turn their face towards you) does work to keep people from slipping away.	2016-12-10 21:23:31Z	Kate Gregory	2

I'm skeptical there even are situations where you could override the effects of traumatic injury by simply talking.  However, it has significant value in assessment. Level of consciousness is the first and most significant vital sign, and being able to monitor it in trauma is crucial. Declines in many body systems will be signaled by the brain first, so you always want to be aware of the patient's mental status. You do that by talking to them. 	2017-11-21 05:48:09Z	Carey Gregory	2

I see two immediate problems, both related to medical privacy: Then there's adoption. If you were adopted and don't know who your birth parents were, is it ok with you if your doctor knows? And gives you nuggets of information about illnesses they've acquired since you were born? If not, then this too will be a giant blank spot since whether or not your adoptive parents (your real parents) have heart trouble isn't interesting from a medical point of view. Then there's the matter of UK residents whose parents or grandparents are not UK residents and therefore have no records with the NHS. Even if a system existed and the legal and privacy issues could be overcome, your doctor isn't going to get access to any family members who live elsewhere. I live in Canada and have relatives in England, so I know this is a real thing. A system that correlated and cross referenced everyone into families, using birth, marriage, and adoption records, so that a doctor could just click "see family history" would be expensive to build and a privacy nightmare if it was hacked. And at the end of it all, it would have blank spots and missing information. It would leave the doctor at risk of telling you things you weren't supposed to know. So all that money would create a flawed and possible even harmful system. Better by far to ask you. You might not know, it's true. But then again, you might. I know what my grandparents died of and the one parent I have lost. Diseases mild enough to be kept from an adult child are also mild enough not to be interesting medically. The "ask the patient" technique may not be perfect, but it's cheap, portable, privacy-respecting, and overall - good enough.	2016-12-14 21:46:47Z	Kate Gregory	2

If there is a small bubble or two in the line after the drip chamber or pump, notice that it doesn't go anywhere. It just sits there and doesn't move with the fluid so it never enters your vein. If the person administering the IV made the serious mistake of not allowing fluid to fill the entire line before attaching it to you, it would still require a very large volume of air to do you any harm, on the order of 100 ml (an entire syringe full of air). This is because bubbles can't travel from the venous circulation to the arterial circulation where they would be dangerous. They will be trapped by the lungs and then slowly reabsorbed. A huge volume of air could cause a "vapor lock" in the right ventricle, which would be dangerous, but small bubbles in an IV are nowhere near enough to do that. The exception to the above would be in people who have a patent foramen ovale (an opening between the right and left sides of the heart), which could allow air bubbles to pass from right to left. However, a patent foramen ovale is normally covered by a flap of tissue except when you bear down hard. So if you're just laying there in a bed, there is virtually no risk presented to you by air bubbles. Having a small bubble or two in your venous circulation doesn't make your blood unhealthy or "bad." They're harmless and will be absorbed and disappear within hours.

Psoriasis treatments aim to: •Stop the skin cells from growing so quickly, which reduces inflammation and plaque formation •Remove scales and smooth the skin, which is particularly true of topical treatments that you apply to your skin Several treatments include:  These synthetic forms of vitamin D slow down the growth of skin cells. Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a prescription cream or solution containing a vitamin D analogue that may be used alone to treat mild to moderate psoriasis or in combination with other topical medications or phototherapy. This treatment can irritate the skin. Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) is expensive but may be equally effective and possibly less irritating than calcipotriene.  This medication is believed to normalize DNA activity in skin cells. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) also can remove scale, making the skin smoother. However, anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains virtually anything it touches, including skin, clothing, countertops and bedding. For that reason, doctors often recommend short-contact treatment — allowing the cream to stay on your skin for a brief time before washing it off.  A thick, black byproduct of the manufacture of petroleum products and coal, coal tar is probably the oldest treatment for psoriasis. It reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. Exactly how it works isn't known. Coal tar has few known side effects, but it's messy, stains clothing and bedding, and has a strong odor. Coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils. It's also available in higher concentrations by prescription. This treatment isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.  By themselves, moisturizing creams won't heal psoriasis, but they can reduce itching and scaling and can help combat the dryness that results from other therapies. Moisturizers in an ointment base are usually more effective than are lighter creams and lotions.  Taken from the leaves of the aloe vera plant, aloe extract cream may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation. You may need to use the cream several times a day for a month or more to see any improvements in your skin.	2016-12-11 03:38:48Z	Prince	1

So a normal person drinking extra water will just make more urine and pee it out. An abnormal person (elderly, alcoholic or brain/kidney-damaged) may not be able to produce/react to these chemical messages properly. However the kidneys need to make sure that this extra urine doesn't take salt (predominantly sodium chloride) with it - the salt concentration is also tightly regulated. The urine it makes must therefore be dilute. If you drink too much water for a prolonged period of time, you wash concentrated salt from the part of the kidney that works to concentrate urine (the renal medulla). So when you   drink all that extra water, your kidneys are less able to conserve water, you will not be able to make concentrated urine and you will actually become dehydrated (volume deplete).	2016-12-11 10:17:11Z	Osmo	1

High doses of caffeine (>600 mg/day) can increase the risk of spontaneous abortion in women (2). Caffeine directly affects the heart. Side effects related to this becomes especially pronounced at higher doses, and can cause tachycardia, and arrythmias (5). Excessive caffeine consumption can result in severe psychological dependence and withdrawal (5). Caffeine use is associated with increased risk of developing anxiety disorders (4). Tolerance also develops with chronic caffeine consumption. Increased doses will be required to achieve the desired effects of enhanced concentration and reduction of fatigue (3). Moderate amounts (100-200 mg/day) however, have been demonstrated to be safe (3). There is some evidence to suggest that caffeine is an effective treatment for ADHD (5)(9). However, caffeine is not indicated for ADHD, and tolerance develops rapidly.  The drugs referenced interact with organisms in unique ways (i.e.: possess unique pharmacodynamics), and in turn, differ in their therapeutic effects, and side effects. The drugs also have varying pharmacokinetic profiles, meaning that they are absorbed, distributed, excreted, and metabolized differently in the body. From  . Additionally, caffeine is a more mild CNS stimulant than the amphetamines (i.e.: methylphenidate and amphetamine). The amphetamines are a more effective treatment for ADHD than caffeine (10) Methylphenidate is a reuptake inhibitor of dopamine (DA), and to a lesser but still marked degree, noradrenaline (NE) (6). This activity increases the effect of these neurotransmitters, resulting in a reduction of symptoms. Amphetamine is a releasing agent of DA, NE, serotonin (5-HT) (6). Side effects such as anorexia, weight loss, and nausea tend to occur more commonly with amphetamine than methylphenidate. (8) In regards to the therapeutic effect, there is no significant difference between methylphenidate and amphetamine overall (7).	2017-09-08 03:35:53Z		4
10403	10494	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10494	Some extended release products do remain in the stomach while the drug is being released but how they remain in the stomach is often not a function of the size of the tablet itself. To help explain I have included some background information about drug formulation. I am referencing the text, Applied Biopharmaceutics & Pharmacokinetics, and my experience as a pharmacy student.  Another term used to describe extended release products is modified release products, this is differentiated from conventional immediate release products. However, even within immediate release formulations, absorption can be slowed due to the drug itself being in an inactive form or if the drug is very lipophilic resulting in slower absorption by the GI tract itself.  Among modified release products, there are several different types of technologies which provide different mechanisms for slowing the release of drugs or altering the drug release mechanism. Some examples of modified release formulations are delayed release (generally include enteric coated), extended release and orally disintegrating.   Delayed release tablets are sometimes enteric coated. This enteric coat is specifically designed to prevent dissolution of the tablet in the stomach. This is sometimes meant to protect the drug from the acidic environment of the stomach, but also sometimes meant to protect the stomach from the disrupting presence of the drug.  Specifically, extended release refers to a drug formulation where the rate of drug release is engineered by a special coating, membrane infused with the drug, capsule with a special opening, a capsule containing special beads, or difficult to dissolve tablet. Some products use multiple mechanisms to achieve the desired rate of drug release. Referencing your question specifically, there are many drugs that remain in the stomach while the release of the drug takes place but this not true of all extended-release formulations (ex: some drugs are designed to remain in the small intestine). Products that remain in the stomach while the drug is released are known as gastroretentive systems.  There are several designs that have been used to maintain the drug in the stomach. A few of these include but are not limited to high-density systems, floating systems, expandable systems, and mucoadhesive or bioadhesive systems. In the expandable systems, one example being metformin ER, a diabetes drug, the tablet unfolds or expands preventing passage through the pyloric sphincter. These expandable tablets make up only a small portion of gastroretentive products. A more common form being the floating or mucoadhesive systems. In the floating systems, the tablet or capsule is designed to be less dense than the stomach contents and thus remain at the top of the stomach while the drug is released. In the mucoadhesive/bioadhesive formulation, the drug has a special coating that allows it to adhere to the wall of the stomach and prevent it from passing through to the small intestine.  Ultimately there are many technologies that allow for extended release products to function. While the overall concept is the same, how it is achieved can be quite different from drug to drug.	2016-12-16 07:46:51Z	Natalie Catalano	3

You know what I also experienced that, according to   that a Sleep has its own cycle. The sleep-wake cycle follows a regular pattern (circadian rhythm) and when you sleep “too much” that pattern shifts. Circadian rhythms are the patterns of repeated activity associated with the environmental cycles of day and night that are repeated every 24 hours.
Once our body clocks start to tell our body the wrong time we feel it in lethargy and fatigue. The clock says one thing and your body says another, very similar to jet lag. 
The average sleep cycle lasts between 80-120 minutes (the average is 90 minutes) and the average person has five of these every night (totaling about 7.5 hours of deep sleep).

Drunks are a daily staple for them, even in "nice" communities. So the following is based on my previous EMS training. It is always unethical not to do an adequate medical assessment, but that doesn't mean you have to treat the thing they're complaining about. First, if they're heavily intoxicated then that means they cannot give informed consent. They are not considered mentally competent to make health care decisions under US case law; I expect it's similar in other western countries. So they became your responsibility the minute you recognized their mental incompetence (failing to recognize it is just as bad). Second, if they're intoxicated then that can mask and/or mimic other concurrent issues. Refusing to at least examine and rule out other problems is therefore negligence. More than one police department has paid a heavy price for jailing "drunks" who were in fact diabetics in insulin shock. Intoxication also dulls pain, so even their own pain assessments can't be trusted. Finally, how intoxicated are they? Remember, being intoxicated means they are your legal and ethical responsibility. Until you've done an adequate assessment to determine that they are mentally competent and not suffering from concealed problems, refusing care will most likely be judged negligence by both medical and legal authorities.  Intoxicated people (by any substance) are the quickest ticket known to loss of license and negligence suits. 	2016-12-04 16:23:15Z	Carey Gregory	3

If your reaction comes from sugar in the form of wheat products or even products containing trace amounts of gluten, this could be the issue.  I went off of wheat over a year ago and my brain fog disappeared and my weight naturally started to drop.  I recommend looking into the book Grain Brain by Dr. Perlmutter.  Gluten sensitivity doesn't always show itself with gut issues.  It can present many of the symptoms that you describe without gut discomfort.  I recommend maybe getting a gluten sensitivity test done to rule that out.  Note: this is not the same as a test for celiac issues.  Gluten is also known to cause anxiety and depression.  Many with Celiac (an extreme version of gluten sensitivity) are known to struggle with anxiety and depression.  Again, I highly recommend looking into Grain Brain.	2016-12-07 21:04:17Z	Terry Palmer	3

I cannot provide any final solution, but the following may help you discuss this with a doctor. Two conditions that came to my mind are: When you eat a large meal, especially if high in carbohydrates, a great amount of glucose will be absorbed in a short time. This may trigger the release of excessive amounts of the hormone insulin, which will result in a drop of glucose not only to normal but to below normal levels (insulin allows glucose to move from the blood into the body cells). This is called "postprandial hypoglycemia" - symptoms are pretty much the same as you have described them. Brain fog and sleepiness can be from low glucose levels, and irritation and thirst (dry mouth?) from high adrenaline levels (as a reaction to low glucose).  Migraine is not a typical symptom of postprandial hypoglycemia, but here is a description of a migraine-like headache after meals ( )	2016-12-08 13:43:36Z	Jan	2

Now there are a few reasons why people might think that this is the case to begin with: When you do grow body hair, it will naturally shed a few hairs while in the growth phase. In fact your hair goes through four very distinct phases: When you are a teenager, your beard is heavily in the anagen phase when it starts to come in.  Therefore with regular shaving, you may notice more and more hairs are sprouting up. Its not actually the shaving that is causing the growth, its just now that your body has started to enter the prime growth phase due uptick of testosterone in your body and with your androgenic hair (i.e. body hair) starting finally grow. Therefore in a relatively short time frame, your beard will seem like it grows in rather rapidly, but in actuality its just that body hair is starting to take form. If you think about it logically, if men who shaved daily had beards that grew in quicker, would have substantial beard growth by midday.  While of course that would be pretty sweet, it just physically doesn’t happen that way. In addition, we would never have bald men…ever. Secondly, hair follicles themselves can be in any one of the four stages that we outlined above. When you shave your beard, you are effectively normalizing all the hair follicles to just one length and when looking at your beard that is only a couple of days old it may appear thicker. With the natural shedding and thinning of your beard that occurs during the exogen phase, when looking at a fresh shaved face, your beard will look more concentrated together. Reference :

10260	10275	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10275	Firstly, I would be reluctant to ascribe those symptoms (recurrent oral canker sores) to acid reflux. In very severe reflux acid can make its way up the oesophagus and can cause chemical burns to the throat and mouth, but there would also be other related symptoms, like nausea, indigestion, heartburn, persistent coughing (caused by acid irritating the larynx) and finally burns to the mouth and a taste of acid in the mouth, especially when lying down. Isolated persistent oral aphthous ulcers is not related to acid reflux. Secondly, there are no oesophageal sphincters, in the usual sense of a muscular structure. The oesophagus is closed above the stomach when it passes through the muscular diaphragm, which applies external pressure on the oesophagus. This is called a 'functional sphincter', as opposed to an 'anatomical sphincter'. Thus, if this hole in the diaphragm is too big it won't be able to close the oesophagus fully and there will be some reflux of stomach acid into the oesophagus. Depending on how large the hole some of the stomach might be able to go through it, what is called a hiatus hernia. There are no exercises that will close this hole in the diaphragm.  Thirdly, if there is a strong history of typical symptoms then a diagnosis of reflux is fairly straightforward. However some tests are usually required to determine severity and possible treatment. Surgery, in severe cases, is recommended and has good results. There are medications that will help lower acidity levels and can eliminate symptoms in mild cases. This is best decided in consultation with a surgeon. A trial of medications is often worthwhile, to assess response to treatment, before surgery is considered. Fourthly, diet plays an important role in the management of reflux. Anything you chew or swallow will cause your stomach to produce acid, but there are certain foods that cause much more acid to be produced or are actually acidic themselves. There are many excellent resources on diet available online or from your doctor. 	2016-11-27 17:27:41Z	Dr Xorile	1

Although it also has its downside such as:  If you have an allergy to onions, you might experience a red, itchy rash when an onion comes into contact with your skin as well as reddened, itchy eyes.   Although not life-threatening, food intolerance can also lead to nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Since onions naturally contain fructose, this can be a source of gas for some people.   If you eat a lot of green onions or rapidly increase your consumption, its vitamin K content might interfere with certain blood-thinner drugs such as Coumadin. If you are currently taking blood-thinners, consult with your healthcare provider before undertaking any dietary changes. But it also has tonnes of  , including: Onions’ sulfurs may be effective anti-inflammatory agents, according to a 1990 study in the journal International Archives of Allergy and Applied Immunology. Quercetin in onion has been found to relax the airway muscles and may provide relief of asthma symptoms, according to a 2013 study in the American Journal of Physiology.  "The polyphenols in onions act as antioxidants, protecting the body against free radicals," said Anne Mauney, a dietitian based in Washington, D.C. Eliminating free radicals can help encourage a strong immune system. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, the quercetin in onions also reduces allergic reactions by stopping your body from producing histamines, which are what make you sneeze, cry and itch if you're having an allergic reaction. Quercetin may be a powerful anti-cancer agent, according to Jarzabkowski. The University of Maryland Medical Center said that quercetin may especially inhibit cancer cells in "breast, colon, prostate, ovarian, endometrial, and lung tumors."  The fiber in onions promotes good digestion and helps keep you regular. Additionally, onions contain a special type of soluble fiber called oligofructose, which helps prevent and treat types of diarrhea. The phytochemicals in onions that scavenge free radicals may also reduce your risk of developing gastric ulcers, according to the National Onion Association. The chromium in onions assists in regulating blood sugar. The sulfur in onions helps lower blood sugar by triggering increased insulin production.

10225	10228	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10228	Drinking the appropriate amount of water is okay, but when it becomes excessive, then it could lead to some dangerous circumstances. The appropriate amount of water varies according to lifestyle. According to the popular 8 by 8 rule which says that one should drink eight glasses, each consisting of eight ounce of water, may not suit every individual. Says nutritionist Venu Adhiya Hirani, "While the general belief is to drink eight to 10 glasses of water, it is advisable to drink 12 to 15 glasses of fluids which includes water, tea, buttermilk, soup, etc. This would amount to an intake of around 2.5 litres of fluids everyday." According to Krishnan, If you have a sedentary lifestyle and work in an air-conditioned environment where there is no scope for water loss via sweat, drinking more than 2 to 2.5 litres of water is not advisable. It will end up accumulating in your kidney and cause edema. For moderate workers like salespersons, who are required to do physical activity, it is important to drink around three litres of water. “It also depends on your size and weight, and also on your activity level and where you live,” Nessler says. “In general, you should try to drink between half an ounce and an ounce of water for each pound you weigh, every day." For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, that would be 75 to 150 ounces of water a day. The sodium content in the blood influences the functioning of the electrolytes. These electrolytes are responsible for sending signals to the cells which control various operations of the body. When you consume too much water, the sodium levels in the blood decrease. This stops the electrolytes from sending signals to the cells. The heart performs the vital function of pumping blood through your entire body. When you consume too much of water, this increases the volume of blood inside your body. The increased blood volume causes unnecessary pressure on the blood vessels and the heart, leading to seizure in some cases. Glomeruli are capillary beds in our kidneys. They work as a filtering station to excrete excess water from the body. Too much of water can cause potential damage to this system, leading to serious health hazards. The kidneys have to work overtime to process all this unnecessary water that is beyond their normal filtering capacity (1000 ml per hour). As your blood gets diluted due to excess water, the concentration of electrolytes in the blood becomes lower than that in the cells. To maintain a balance in the concentration of electrolytes in the blood and the cells, water begins to flow into the cells. This results in swelling of cells, which is a dangerous condition. This is the swelling of brain cells. It is as hazardous as it sounds. Most of the cells in our body have a lot of room to stretch out. But the flat bones in our skull do not leave much space for the brain cells to be accommodated freely. When excess water in the blood vessels starts seeping into the brain cells, it causes swelling in the cells of the brain. This leads to severe conditions that include coma, brainstem herniation, and respiratory attack.  There has even been a   of a man who died drinking 10 litres of water within eight hours.	2016-11-23 11:39:34Z	Prince	4

"Patients often say their vision fluctuates throughout the day without other symptoms. This is often a symptom of ocular surface problems, such as dry eye or blepharitis," Dr. Rapuano says.  Eric D. Donnenfeld, MD, in practice in Rockville Centre, N.Y., agrees that the most significant symptom is a history of visual fluctuations. "Many patients will not associate visual fluctuation with dry eye. However, damage to the ocular surface will change the quality of vision," he explains. "Therefore, patients present with comments, such as, "My vision changes between blinks"; "My vision is blurry at the end of the day, but it is good in the morning"; and "I blink hard, and then I can see better." Any type of visual fluctuation that changes between blinks or during the course of the day is dry eye until proven otherwise, according to Dr. Donnenfeld. "The only exception is patients who have radial keratotomy, where the vision can fluctuate throughout the course of the day. For the most part, this symptom is a gold standard for me that this patient needs to be managed for dry eye. For instance, following cataract surgery or LASIK or PRK, patients often will complain of visual fluctuation and they will assume it is a problem with refractive surgery when in reality the cause of their problem is ocular surface disease and dry eye. Managing that will generally solve the problem," he says. While it is known that the timing of symptoms is important, it bears repeating says Dr. Rapuano. "If the dry-eye symptoms tend to be when the patient wakes up in the morning, it tends to be blepharitis. If it is worse and worse throughout the day, then it tends to be a dry-eye type problem," he says.	2016-11-23 07:34:57Z	Prince	1

Chronic hiccups can be a symptom of another disorder, so sometimes treatment is based on treating the underlying condition. There are also medicines that can ease very severe cases of chronic hiccups, but they are not the sort of medication you should be taking on your own. If you need medicines, adequate therapy can be prescribed by your physician - which is another good reason for a visit to the doctor's office. References:

One of the theories states that it may be caused by the reduced effectiveness of the body's natural endorphin painkillers and the increased presence of a chemical called "substance P." Substance P amplifies pain signals. Another theory states that fibromyalgia is caused by biochemical changes in the body and may be related to hormonal changes or menopause. In addition, some (but not all) people with fibromyalgia have low levels of human growth hormone, which may contribute to the muscle pain.  As I said earlier, the cause of fibromyalgia is still unclear, but there are some factors that may result to fibromyalgia, which are; Genetics.

10119	10125	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10125	Drinking water during or after a meal actually aids digestion. Water and other liquids help break down food so that your body can absorb the nutrients. Water also softens stools, which helps prevent constipation. Despite the fact that it aids digestion, it also has its down-side such as the fact that it would slow the digestion process and reduce the body’s ability to produce enough digestive enzymes to digest foods properly. Without proper digestion, a build up of toxic waste can occur no matter what you are eating. It is important to note that drinking water during a meal would be more beneficial than not drinking while eating if you are not properly hydrated before hand. Eating while dehydrated can cause the body to have a very tough time digesting food. Based on the information presented, when thinking about how to approach eating meals yourself, there are several tips we can apply. It appears most beneficial to stay hydrated throughout the day and if you must drink while you eat, avoid drinking too much, as well as alcohol and acidic drinks. Drink warm water and drink it sparingly. A small glass will likely not interfere with digestion and by adding a dash of apple cider vinegar or lemon, you can aid in the digestive process further. If you can, you might want to try drinking 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after a meal with no drinking during, see how you feel. If it works for you, then stick with what works, if not, adjust accordingly.	2016-11-15 19:20:09Z	Prince	3

How do you achieve a work/life balance when you're being forced to work virtually non stop? Well, for this I will refer to my university days where in the lead up to exams, it was pretty common to spend a month or so on a fairly similar schedule as yourself.  By and large, it should be fairly easy to stay  : Avoid high sugar contents or excessive caffeine consumption. These are great for sprints where you have 4 hours to finish a job. But this isn't a sprint, this is a marathon. Binging on sugar and caffeine will help you on that day, but you will be in a real trough the following day and the day after (which will make you crave more sugar/caffeine and the cycle continues). I'm not saying don't have a coffee and a bowl of coco pops; I'm saying don't have four 500ml cans of Monster Energy.  I assume you'll be working at a desk as well so if you make sure you take regular stretches or short walks (even just to the canteen and back) every hour or so you should be fine. Otherwise, you will feel stiff and tired. Yoga or any other more intense exercise (a short run?) would also be excellent every few days if you find the time, but if not then don't worry too much about it.  Make sure you set up your desk properly: screen at the right level, seat adjusted, use the back rest, don't slouch etc. There is plenty of guidance online (first link on google I found:  ) on how to sit properly at a desk, but you need to be disciplined and actually follow it. You'll really struggle if two weeks in you find you've got a horrible knot in your back or twinge in your neck that makes using your computer uncomfortable. As someone who works a 9-5 office job, I can't really stress how big a difference this can make enough.  Also it goes without saying but try to get ~8 hours sleep a night. Don't stay up too late, with limited time you might really struggle to claw back a sleep deficit. EDIT: Also drink water. Half the reasons people feel tired, depressed, lathargic etc is because they are dehydrated. If your pee is yellow and smells, you are already dehydrated and need to immediately drink water. If you are thirsty then it's already too late. Don't worry about going to the toilet every two hours, if your pee is clear and odorless then you are on the right track! Make sure you're always topped up. Keep a bottle on your desk, or leave a note to yourself. Ultimately, keep your discipline, you're body should be totally fine. Don't stress too much about that. If you do all of the above, you'll probably end up healthier than you already are if you're of average fitness currently.  What you should be more concerned about is your  : This WILL knock the absolute shit out of you mentally. You need to go into this with the right attitude and build yourself a few crutches to lean on along the way.

Write yourself a little message on a post-it note and stick it to your desk, or bathroom mirror or at your bed to remind you that this isn't forever and that it will all be worth it in the end.  Work/Life balance is out the window, you don't have time to do the job and have planned time to yourself and sleep. What I would suggest is to   time for yourself, even 15 minutes every few hours: step away from your computer and go outside and get some sun. Don't even look at your phone. Just 'meditate' in the simplest form possible: do nothing. Do absolutely nothing and revel in it.  If the opportunity is there (which I imagine it is) make a few friends. Everyone will be suffering the same so see if you can build a few relationships with your peers. Also, you might start to feel homesick so plan for a daily phonecall to someone you know (even if it's just for 5 minutes) on the outside world (Partner, parent, friend) and let them know exactly how you feel.   Ultimately this entire exercise is about discipline: stay disciplined and focused on the goal, accept that it's going to be awful, and get on with it using every possible trick or crutch you have available to you.

The fact that déjà vu occurs so randomly and rapidly—and in individuals without a medical condition—makes it difficult to study, and why and how the phenomenon occurs is up to much speculation. A related theory states that déjà vu is a fleeting malfunctioning between the long- and short-term circuits in the brain. Researchers postulate that the information we take in from our surroundings may "leak out" and incorrectly shortcut its way from short- to long-term memory, bypassing typical storage transfer mechanisms. When a new moment is experienced—which is currently in our short-term memory—it feels as though we're drawing upon some memory from our distant past. What triggers it? The actual trigger for it in healthy individuals is not exactly known, but we do know those same regions of memory and memory monitoring are involved. One explanation for déjà vu is that there is a split-second delay in transferring information from one side of the brain to the other.

10093	10094	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10094	Diagnosis of myocarditis To diagnose myocarditis, your doctor may conduct a physical examination, and discuss your medical history and any signs or symptoms you may have. If your doctor suspects myocarditis, he or she might order one or more tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of your condition, including: MRI. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will show your heart's size, shape and structure. This test can show signs of inflammation of the heart muscle and help make or confirm a diagnosis of myocarditis. Echocardiogram. Sound waves, or ultrasound, can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram might detect enlargement of your heart, poor pumping function, valve problems or fluid around your heart. Cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy. In this test, a small tube (catheter) is inserted into a vein in your leg or neck and then is threaded into your heart. In some cases, doctors use a special instrument to remove a tiny sample of heart muscle tissue (biopsy) for analysis in the lab to see if there are signs of inflammation or infection. Symptoms of myocarditis The most common symptom of myocarditis is shortness of breath during exercise or exertion. Other symptoms may include fatigue, heart palpitations and chest pain or pressure. The legs also may swell. Rarely, myocarditis causes a sudden loss of consciousness that may be due to abnormal heart rhythms. In summary, patients may experience some, all or none of the following symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, irregular heartbeat, sudden loss of consciousness. Can myocarditis be confused with other heart diseases? Yes. For example, the symptoms of heart failure, including shortness of breath, fatigue, inability to tolerate exercise, and associated with difficulty breathing while laying down/sleeping are common to many heart diseases besides myocarditis.  One feature that distinguishes myocarditis from other causes of heart failure is that it often follows an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection and is due to a specific immune response against the heart itself.	2016-11-14 09:38:52Z	Prince	1

10090	10099	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10099	According to a common misconception, your ears keep growing because of the cartilage, which supposedly keeps growing your entire life.  In reality cartilage doesn’t keep growing in size your entire life, the real reason why our ears – and also our noses! – keep growing is the result of gravity, and a special kind of cartilage in your ears. In our body there are three different forms of cartilage; Hyaline, Elastic, and Fibrocartilage. The difference between the three types lies in the kind of protein fiber, their amount and the way it’s constructed.  Elastic cartilage and gravity are the reason why it seems our ears keep growing  The type of cartilage that can be found in our ear is the elastic variety. And as the name elastic cartilage already implies, its main component is elastic fibers – which give your ear more flexibility. As with all collagen and elastin fibers in our body, they begin to break down when we age. This is causing them to stretch and sag, making them appear longer. As mentioned before, the actual cause of our seemingly-swelling snout is gravity. When we age, the collagen and elastin fibers that make up cartilage begin to break down. This causes them to stretch and sag, making them appear longer. Our skin giving structural support to cartilage also contains collagen and elastin fibers that droop over time. This compounds the lengthening problem.	2016-11-14 13:38:13Z	Prince	0

If there was any significant risk of open-mouth breathing leading to pollution-related illnesses, I'm sure we would have heard about it by now.

Prenatal smoking has been associated with premature births, low-birthweight, as well as behavioral problems throughout childhood and adolescence.  It is important to note, however, that the severity of these effects depend on a number of factors, including length of time the mother smoked while pregnant, how much she smoked while pregnant, as well as other health-related issues of the mother.

Your first doctor stated he would do Ultra Lasik. He told why it is better, using those benefits as his rationale for the choice. He chose Ultra because of the surgical benefit (thinner flap, shorter recovery time, etc...), not because of any clinical limitations due to your corneas. 
Your second surgeon said you don't have any problems with your cornea, so you don't "need" to have Ultra Lasik. Your first surgeon would definitely have told you if you have a problem with your corneas limiting your Lasik options. So, that is something upon which both of them must agree. The econd surgeon reserves Ultra for patients with issues. It costs more, but they don't have the options you have. Your first surgeon is recommending the superior technique. Money for newer procedure may be part of his motivation, but the fact that Ultra Lasik is better is not in question. If you want the best technique, Ultra Lasik is your answer. You don't "need" it, so spending the extra money isn't necessary if it will be a hardship. Hey, if you choose Ultra, either physician could perform the procedure..OR...having made the clinical decision, you can shop around to optimize price! As a person with the "problem" corneas, I can say you are in an enviable position. Good luck! I hope this answers your question.	2016-11-16 03:44:59Z	MDGadget	-2

ASL is based on French Sign Language, the first sign language teacher came from France. AFAIK, the Franch sign language formed spontaneously as soon as there were cities and communities of deaf children. When there is no sign language, but other people who are deaf, the children will spontaneously begin to sign and create a new language. Abroad, many countries got their first language from teacher from the US, so for example Philippine's Sign Language is based on ASL.  These languages have almost no relationship to the speaking communities language. ASL's grammar is more similar to Chinese than to English. But what about fingerspell? Yes, that is one way that English can be encode with your hands. Attempting to write English with your hands is mind-numbingly slow. To communicate at a normal rate, you have to use strategies that prevent 1:1 compatibility with English. This doesn't stop well wishing amateurs from suggesting some sort of "manual English", SEE (Signed Exact English) is one current contender for a "English-fied" sign language. Regarding dialects of ASL, there are a certain number of Deaf schools. Community differences in signing vary by which school you attended. One famous example is the many regionally different ways to sign Pizza in ASL. Braille on the otherhand is  . The blind can hear and speak English just fine. So their community is the English speaking community & can read it just fine. For the Deaf community, where ASL is their first language, often they don't learn English as well. This creates a massive cultural war between those who want to force English on the Deaf (at the expense of ASL) and those who favor bilingualism. AFAIK, no one is advocating ASL-only, the Deaf need to deal with the hearing community all the time and it's uncontroversially valuable to be able to understand English, the more fluent the better.	2016-11-12 19:45:35Z	MatthewMartin	4

He was taken to the hospital immediately after the accident where his blood draw was 0.29 BAC EVEN THOUGH HE WAS NOT OBSERVED TO BE INTOXICATED BY THE LAW OFFICER OR THE ER MEDICAL STAFF. I observed him prior to this accident showing signs of intestinal distress, an altered mental state, memory problems, severe bloating, and general flu-like symptoms.  Just like several other confirmed ABS patients, he took a course of antibiotics in 2013 as prescribed by his Primary Healthcare Physician. Autobrewery Syndrome is believed to be caused by common opportunistic yeast and bacteria found in the intestines of most humans.  Carbohydrates (sugars and starches) are consumed normally and after they leave the stomach, the yeast and bacteria in the small intestine begin using that energy to ferment and create ethanol.  At some point, the population of yeast and bacteria go into ethanol overdrive and make the person intoxicated - without that person having had a single sip of alcohol. The earliest scientific literature I could find on the syndrome is from Japan in the 1930s.  It has popped up occasionally since then as a medical oddity article.  In 2013, Dr. Barbara Cordell published a new paper describing the timeline and symptoms of a person eventually diagnosed with Autobrewery Syndrome. My husband is now a regular patient of Dr. Kanodia's and we consult regularly with Dr. Cordell to discuss dietary issues specific to ABS sufferers. As a direct result of Autobrewery Syndrome, my husband was convicted of a DUII, reckless driving, and criminal negligence by the State of Oregon in January 2016.  The mandatory restitution we now owe to the State of Oregon exceeds $ 382,000 dollars (USD). We are appealing this original conviction based upon the fact that the State of Oregon violated his Civil Rights during the trial.  He was not allowed to use his medical diagnosis in his own legal defense - per the judge's orders issued the night before his trial. We have created a website regarding our story and the impact ABS has had on our lives.  We also have a Facebook page if you'd like to communicate further with either of us. Sierra & Ray Lewis

It helps replenish lost mineral content in the teeth and helps revive their white color. You can use common salt regularly each morning as a tooth powder instead of toothpaste. Another option is to mix common salt with charcoal and brush your teeth with it regularly.
You can also mix common salt with baking soda and gently rub it on your teeth.
Be extra careful using salt as it can cause damage to your gums and tooth enamel if used roughly.   The bleaching property present in lemons can also help get rid of yellow discoloration. In fact, gargling with lemon juice and scrubbing your teeth with lemon peel is one of the best ways to make your teeth white again. Mix together a few drops of lemon juice and some salt.
Apply the mixture on the stained teeth and rub the paste vigorously over your teeth and gums. Leave it on for a few minutes and then rinse your mouth thoroughly with water.
Do this twice daily for about two weeks to get rid of tartar and the yellow tinge. Cleaning your teeth with fresh orange peel on a regular basis will reduce the yellow tinge accumulated on your teeth. Rub orange peel over your teeth every night before going to sleep. The vitamin C and calcium in the orange peel will combat the microorganisms throughout the night.
Do this for a few weeks and you will notice effective results.
If fresh orange peel is not available, you can use dried orange peel powder. Strawberries contain a good amount of vitamin C, which helps make your teeth whiter. Grind a few strawberries into a paste. Rub the paste on your teeth gently. If done twice daily for a few weeks, the yellow tinge on your teeth will vanish.
Another option is to mix the pulp of one strawberry with one-half teaspoon of baking soda and spread the mixture onto your teeth and let it sit for a few minutes. Rinse out your mouth and brush your teeth with toothpaste to get rid of any residue.	2016-11-10 07:02:24Z	Lakshmi Balan	-4

However, several articles address the issue of water temperature and rehydration. Two studies have shown that when you are in a state of dehydration (in these studies, after physical activity), the optimal drinking-water temperature in terms of good hydration and lower sweating (which causes water loss as a cooling mechanism) was found to be 16°C. To quote the conclusions of both studies: "When dehydrated subjects drink water with different temperatures, there are different sweating responses together with different voluntary intakes. According to our results, consuming 16°C water, cool tap water, could be suggested in dehydration." "For athletes dehydrated in hot environments, maximum voluntary drinking and best hydration state occurs with 16°C water.Provision of fluid needs and thermal needs could be balanced using 16°C water.Drinking 16°C water (nearly the temperature of cool tap water) could be recommended for exercise in the heat."

But still, the find was disturbing because for decades after smallpox was declared eradicated in the 1980s, world health authorities believed the only samples left were safely stored in super-secure laboratories in Atlanta and in Russia. There is a vaccine against smallpox that was a key tool in the eradication of the disease. This vaccine does not contain the variola virus which causes smallpox, but a closely related virus called vaccinia. When this vaccine is given to humans, it protects them against smallpox. However, it may have rare, but serious side effects, which in extreme cases can be fatal. Since smallpox was eradicated, the vaccine is not recommended in routine immunization. It is used to protect researchers who work on the variola virus that causes smallpox and other viruses in the same virus family (known as orthopox viruses). It could also be used to protect anyone else judged to have a high risk of exposure to smallpox.  Vaccination with the vaccinia virus as a protection against smallpox is not recommended for widespread use. No government gives or recommends the vaccine routinely since it can cause serious complications, and even death. It should be given only to those persons who have a high risk of coming into contact with the virus which causes smallpox, or who have been exposed.	2016-11-08 10:25:30Z	Prince	2

“A pimple is a result of a blockage of the skin's pore. 
 Inside the pore are sebaceous glands which produce sticky sebum. When the outer layers of skin shed (as it does continuously), the dead skin cells left behind may become 'glued' together by the sticky sebum. This causes a blockage in the pore. The sebaceous glands produce more sebum which builds up behind the blockage, and this sebum harbours bacteria (P.Acnes bacteria). Since the body's natural defence against bacteria is primarily phagocytes (white blood cells), these rush to the site behind the blockage (where the bacteria are). This is what gives some pimples the 'whiteheads' (unless the Phagocytes are deeper in the skin, which means you can't see the 'white' caused by them). The white blood cells then destroy (by phagocytosis) the bacteria to prevent infection.” Over-the-counter medications Common over-the-counter medications for pimples are benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid and antibacterial agents such as triclosan. Both medications can be found in many creams and gels used to treat acne (acne vulgaris) through topical application. Both medications help skin slough off more easily, which helps to remove bacteria faster. Before applying them the patient needs to wash his or her face with warm water and dry Home-remedies Lemon juice can help get rid of breakouts for a number of reasons. It is rich in vitamin C, which is good for all types of skin, and it’s a citric acid, so it helps ‘exfoliate’ the skin as well. Most importantly though, it is an astringent. An astringent will cause a contraction of body tissues, and will therefore dry out the blemish itself. The reason it is suggested that milk would cause acne is because of the extra hormones in it-but unless it’s ingested, this doesn’t really do much. For the most part, it just soothes the irritated skin, and helps tone down the redness. Egg whites are an easy and affordable way to help reduce acne and fade scars left by unfortunate blemishes. The reason people have found egg whites to be helpful for their skin is because they’re chock full of proteins and vitamins that both combat acne, and help to rebuild your skin cells.

9971	9977	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9977	According to  , A pimple is a small pustule or papule. Pimples are small skin lesions or inflammations of the skin - they develop when sebaceous glands (oil glands) become clogged and infected, leading to swollen, red lesions filled with pus. Pimples are also known as spots or zits The development of pimples is primarily connected to oil production, dead skin cells, clogged pores and bacteria (although yeast infection can also cause pimples to develop) Sebaceous glands, which are located at the base of hair follicles, can become overactive due to hormone dysregulation, which is why acne is most commonly associated with puberty, and why breakouts occur around the time of menses. The most likely parts of the body to be affected by pimples are the face, back, chest and shoulders due to the proliferation of sebaceous glands in these areas of skin. Pimples are a sign of acne, especially when a breakout occurs.  ( ) Apple cider vinegar: Noted for promoting energy and good digestion, consider apple cider vinegar also has potent antibacterial and antifungal properties, helping to kill off acne-causing bacteria. It also balances pH levels in the skin, making it more difficult for bacteria to come back. Simply dilute a little with fresh water, pour onto a cloth and apply. Use once a day.  Green tea extract: Green tea is an all-round health hero. As the Mayo Clinic reports, a lotion of 2 percent green tea extract helped reduce acne in two studies of adolescents and young adults with mild to moderate acne. While no studies have been done with older adults, this could be an excellent addition to your natural remedies for acne. Coconut oil: This healthy superfood is also soft and gentle on the skin. It can bring down acne redness and fight bacteria. Use just a little and see how your skin improves.  Zinc. This nutrient helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses. Zinc in natural lotions and creams may reduce acne breakouts. Herbs are also a simple at-home remedy for acne that can be effective. We’d recommend trying these herbal remedies: Aloe vera. The popular spiky green plant is one of the most commonly used herbs in America today. It’s used for soothing and healing burns, wounds and skin irritations, so include it in your herbal remedies for acne. Use aloe as a spot treatment on the infected areas to help bring down swelling and redness. Tea tree oil: Tea tree oil is excellent for adult acne. Its antibacterial properties help to remove dead skin, cleanse pores and kill acne-causing bacteria. Combine a little with water to dilute it, or mix it with some aloe vera gel and apply on your skin. A word of caution: Never ingest it or get it in your eyes or nose.  Chasteberry, also known as vitex or monk’s pepper, was used by Hippocrates to treat injuries and inflammation. American Family Physician highlights a 2001 German study showing that chasteberry’s active ingredients can influence particular hormones, including those associated with hormonal acne.

Some even clearly depicting concern for pornography or over self-stimulation (masturbation) causing sexual performance problems in the bedroom.. However due to the field and nature in which studies be performed, this field has limited research. There are different types of ED as well. Some can be psychological, some physical health issues. In diagnosing this, your doctor would need to see if this is a psychiatric problem, or a physical health problem. Once they determine what course of action, they can then help the patient with rehab or treatment for the issue. To sum that up, ED has many causes however there is very limited research since a broad spectrum of things can manifest into ED.  The largest two causes are Old age which can effect hormone secretion and your genitals ability to physically perform. The other most common cause is some psychological issues that would need to be diagnosed and treated by a therapist. On a side note,I've encountered ED commonly in the field and nearly 50% of those patients presented with a sexual PTSD or irrational fear of sexual encounters. That's just my personal experience, but there is no direct scientific evidence that clearly states pornography is a cause for concern. However, depending on who you ask, this answer may also change.

I'm mainly aware of evidence from studies on sodium bicarbonate, as an example for a simple way to supplement alkaline food. So technically you could say that alkaline food "helps to regulate internal pH", but it is a very weak influence. To emphasize the impact of other contributing factors to blood pH, it is also interesting to look at something like this: This example shows why it is difficult to separate the effect from alkaline food from other factors contributing to pH homeostasis. Taking a few deep breaths or holding your breath has a very immediate effect on blood pH, which can easily bias the more subtle effect from an alkaline diet. I'm not an expert, but I could imagine that the respiratory rate is even determined by dietary factors. Thus, instead of studying the effect on internal pH, it might be more sensible to show that an alkaline diet leads to reduced breathing in the long term, because the body could maintain the same pH level even with higher carbon dioxide levels.	2017-10-07 14:14:42Z	bluenote10	3

Anaphylactic shock may have multiple signs and symptoms, such as: urticaria and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; hypotension; cardiac arrhythmias; unconsciousness and shock (this is an incomplete list, see picture and references for more). All these adverse reactions occur in the context of an IgE-mediated mechanism. IgE is a type of antibody, which is released in huge amounts in the body when a person is exposed to any type of allergen which they are sensitive to following a first exposure (of course, different people may have different allergies; some may have several, some may have none).
When IgE antibodies are released in the body, they cause multiple effects that comprise the anaphylactic shock (some were mentioned above, see references below for others).

9953	9978	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9978	Osteoporosis exercises are encouraged for a number of reasons. First and foremost exercise is good in a general sense, but building muscle strength can be really beneficial to people who may be at risk of losing bone mass. 
Stronger muscles can help improve balance, which can prevent falls.  Balancing exercises are therefore a good addition to any workout routine. Regular exercise that includes muscle strength or resistance training, as well as weight-bearing aerobic activity can help prevent bone loss, as we get older. You don’t have to get overly aggressive, especially if you have already had a fall and are nervous about exercise. Nonimpact activities such as balance and posture exercises can benefit people with osteoporosis even though they don’t build bone density. These non-impact approaches can still increase muscle strength and decrease your risk of falling and potentially breaking bones. If you are at risk of osteoporosis or you have already been diagnosed with osteoporosis, most doctors agree that supervised weight-bearing exercise is the safest. Exercises which strengthen bones and reduce fractures risk If you want to experience the benefits of exercise and reduce fracture risk there are four different areas you should consider.  – This area of exercise focuses on free weights, such as dumbbells, weight machines or exercise bands. They can make muscles and bones work by lifting, pushing and pulling.  – These exercises reduce your base of support. For example, instead of standing on two legs, you stand on one. Challenging your balance can actually strengthen your balance.  – This involves paying attention to how different parts of your body are aligned. The alignment of the spine can become a concern for people with osteoporosis.  – This can be rhythmic activity that you do for at least 10 minutes at a time. Jumping rope, tennis or dancing are good examples. Yoga and Pilates are two very popular forms of exercise today. They can improve strength, balance and flexibility. While they may sound enticing, certain positions may not be safe for people with osteoporosis. As an example, movements that require you to bend forward could increase your chance of breaking a bone in your spine. Here are some of the exercises that fall into the above categories and that osteoporosis sufferers say they have had success with.	2016-11-07 11:48:50Z	Laura	1
9952	9961	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9961	Stimulating these points with pressure, needles, or heat triggers the release of endorphins, which are the neurochemicals that relieve pain. As a result, pain is blocked and the flow of blood and oxygen to the affected area is increased. This causes the muscles to relax and promotes healing. Because acupressure inhibits the pain signals sent to the brain through a mild, fairly painless stimulation, it has been described as closing the "gates" of the pain-signaling system, preventing painful sensations from passing through the spinal cord to the brain. Theory Your body is composed of a network of energy channels, also called “meridians,” which draw the vital life force, or “qi,” from food, air and your environment in general, according to Iona Teeguarden, a Jin Shin Do acupuncturist and co-author of “A Complete Guide to Acupressure.” When qi flows smoothly, you can easily maintain a state of health. When qi becomes blocked—often due to stress, change or injury—symptoms such as nausea can arise. How It Works When you press an acupressure point, you release physical tension in the muscles and allow blood to flow, notes Susan Lark, women’s health and preventive medicine expert and author of “Dr. Susan Lark’s The Estrogen Decision Self Help Book.” On a more subtle level, Lark notes, qi begins to flow freely, allowing the body and mind to return to a state of balance. One way to think of an acupressure point is as a valve that sits on an energy line. Massaging the point opens the valve, releasing any stagnation in the line and allowing qi flow to resume.	2016-11-06 18:21:32Z	Prince	2

So, what passes for a healthy, well-balanced diet is a diet that isn't too bad, but certainly not the most healthy diet you can imagine. This should be considered to be a compromise between what is extremely healthy and what the general public can be convinced to stick to.  If you then further compromise on this by getting about 10% more of your calories from sugars and fats, of which a large fraction will be saturated fats, you're going to do yet more damage to your body.

Just as water foams up when it comes out of the tap quickly, urine will foam if it hits the toilet quickly. The foam should also clear up quickly. Sometimes, urine can also foam up when it’s concentrated. Your urine will be more concentrated if you haven’t had much water to drink and you’re dehydrated.  Foamy urine can also indicate that you have too much of a protein, such as albumin, in your urine. The protein in your urine reacts with the air to create foam.  A less common cause of foamy urine is retrograde ejaculation, which is a condition that happens in men when semen backs up into the bladder instead of being released from the penis. Taking the medicine phenazopyridine (Pyridium, Azo-Standard, Uristat, AZO) is another less common cause of foamy urine. People take this medication to treat urinary tract infections.	2016-11-04 17:18:39Z	Prince	3

In your case, if you had pancreatitis severe enough to perforate the splenic artery (or another of the many large vessels touching the pancreas), the answer is "not much, cause you're already in bad shape". Then again, if that were the case, you'd have most likely been in the ICU before the hemorrhage happened for treatment of severe pancreatitis, and would have required surgery or interventional radiology to fix the bleeding, and the transfusion requirement would have been higher than three units, because blood loss quickly rises to litres from a major vessel like that. The other option is known as hemorrhagic pancreatitis in which you bleed into the tissue of the pancreas itself. It doesn't necessary mean you'd end up needing surgery, and if you did, it would not have been for bleeding, it'd have been to clean out the dead parts of the pancreas. In such a case, blood loss would not be severe (minimal, in fact), but coupled with the rest of the stuff that goes very very wrong during pancreatitis, you'd have needed a modest transfusion anyway, in order to keep your blood hemoglobin content optimal, rather than just good enough (we don't usually transfuse to optimal, because the benefit of that is usually nowhere near as large as the risks of the transfusion itself, so we settle for good enough, if possible).	2016-11-04 05:57:04Z	mismas	2

This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
It is an autosomal recessive disorder - a genetic mutation in an autosome (a non-sex chromosome) that only occurs when either both parents are affected or are carriers of the recessive genes which are then passed on homozygously to the child  As for their life expectancy, Congenital insensitivity of pain is often seen as a condition exhibited in children as the life expectancy of patients with CIP is very low.

Once the male embryo produces testosterone, the hormone can influence other sex-specific traits around the body. Men having nipples doesn't really have any evolutionary advantage, but it usually doesn't hurt anything either. Barring specific medical conditions—like a tumor on the pituitary gland—men generally lack the necessary levels of prolactin to stimulate lactation and cannot produce milk. Despite having a limited amount of underdeveloped breast tissue, men are still capable of getting breast cancer.

Since all embryos have the tissue required to develop breast, and since there's nothing to stop that developmental pathway, they go ahead and develop them. And since doing so does not negatively affect their reproductive success later in life, they are at no disadvantage to any potential male who might express a mutation that would stop the development of breast tissue, so they go right ahead and reproduce with their wildtype, which then allows this trait to continue in spite of its lack of utility.	2016-11-03 12:54:19Z	mismas	1

And findings from a study in 2011 in Neurology suggested that one reason why people in the stroke belt states of the South have higher rates of stroke is that Southerners eat more fried fish than other Americans. Still, this is no reason to hang up the fishing reel. After all, the latest study, which included only women, also reaffirmed that fish is good for your heart—if you broil or bake it.

Your eyes are no longer currently accustomed to having that kind of lens in front of them, so it feels the same way it did when you put glasses on for the first time. I would guess that the -2.5 power is the lens which makes a more significant correction to the lens of one of your eyes. I don't remember the numbers for the lenses of my glasses, but my left eye is further off (more nearsighted) than my right eye, so if I were to not wear glasses for a few days, my left eye would notice it more when I put my glasses back on. I think it was after I had not worn glasses for a while - maybe months - that my vision was evaluated again, and both eyes had changed. My left eye was less nearsighted and my right eye was more nearsighted. So, I would guess that not wearing glasses makes your eyes exercise harder at focusing, which might change the shape of the lenses in either direction. Maybe after wearing your old glasses for a couple weeks, giving your eyes a chance to get used to them again, if that eye is still not focusing satisfactorily, you should go to the optometrist and have them see if your eyes have changed.

Dimples are caused by a fault in the subcutaneous connective tissue that develops in course of the embryonic development. A variation in the structure of the facial muscle may also cause dimples.

These days, leeches are used to help heal skin grafts -- the process for treating burns in which blood tissue is transferred from one part of the body to another -- by removing blood pooled under the graft and restoring blood circulation in blocked veins. They've also been used in reattaching fingers and other body parts HOW IT WORKS The anticoagulant is useful to patients in a grafting or reattachment procedure. A doctor attaches a leech to the skin near the graft or reconnected digit. As the leech feeds, it releases the blood thinner into the patient's soft tissue, preventing clotting and allowing for continuous blood circulation, which is necessary for the procedure to be successful. When the leech fills with blood, it eventually falls off, but the patient continues to bleed, allowing for continued circulation and new vein growth. Depending on the nature of the procedure, leeches are typically used constantly (replaced as they drop off every 20 minutes or so) for up to two days and then often intermittently for a few days following the procedure So, in a nutshell, Yes, leeches are still used in modern medicine for skin-grafts, finger-grafts, etc. Medicinal leeches are still used today, to the extent of getting them on sale, that is, they are still being sold.	2016-11-01 01:15:27Z	Prince	2

Hot teas, tea with lemon and/or honey, chicken soup have all been documented anecdotally to contribute to early recovery.
And like your own experience, taking rest and your mind off the cold do helps 'hasten' time before you get well again.  Hope this answers your question.	2016-10-30 13:44:51Z	Jagan Mohan	-1

The researchers attribute the finding to the impaired functioning of the immune system, when sleeping less. This may not answer your question directly, but it is related. (emphasis mine) The study identifies 6h of sleep as the threshold under which catching the infection becomes more likely. To try and explain this phenomenon, the researchers cite studies that have shown that lack of sleep can disturb the effectiveness of the immune system: Source: Prather AA; Janicki-Deverts D; Hall MH, Cohen S.  .

It's one of the first pieces of advice you get when you're sick, but we can never stress it enough: give your body time to fight off the virus, and don't waste that energy elsewhere. A number of studies found that sleep deprivation results in poorer immune function. Not only do good sleep habits help you fight off a cold, but they will even increase your resistance to catching one in the first place. So, if you're sick, it's important to get plenty of rest—but don't neglect it when you're healthy either. Make sure this is quality sleep, too: drugs like NyQuil contain alcohol, and we already know what that does to your sleep cycle.

9798	9823	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9823	The phenomenon you are describing of the pupils dilating when telling a lie has to do with the way the muscles around the eye are wired to the nervous system, and more specifically, the autonomic nervous system. For better understanding, I suggest reading the chapter about neurotransmission in any introductory pharmacology book, such as   (chapter 6 in 12th edition), or   (chapter 8 in 12th edition). However, I will try to explain it briefly here. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates bodily functions that occur without conscious control (involuntary actions). This system is divided into two branches: The sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system; each can be described by a short general statement, as follows: The sympathetic system is more active in a "fight or flight" situations, and the parasympathetic system is more active in a "rest and digest" state. In other words, the sympathetic nervous system adjusts your body to deal with some kind of threat to your safety, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system adjusts your body to conserve energy and be efficient when resting (i.e. good sleep,good digestion etc.) Now, lying usually involves some level of tension or anxiety (unless you are a very good liar), because you might be worried to a certain degree that the lie will be revealed. This tension subconsciously triggers the sympathetic nervous system, which will cause certain effects throughout your body. Sympathetic stimulation to the eye will cause contraction of the radially oriented pupillary dilator muscle fibers in the iris and will result in mydriasis (dilation of the pupil). An opposite effect is achieved when the eye receives parasympathetic stimulation (i.e. when you are calmer, maybe after confessing the truth...), and the pupil undergoes miosis (constriction). In short, since lying usually involves tension, and tension is associated with increased sympathetic activity, the pupil will dilate following sympathetic stimulation. This point leads us to the other part of your question: other physical symptoms of lying are actually other manifestations of increased sympathetic activity (for a more thorough review, please see the texts I recommended above). Among others, common effects are: rise in blood pressure,increased heart rate, and increased sweating.	2016-10-28 22:57:53Z	Don_S	4

On average, it takes 18 hours for a male to return to its normal ejaculate volume. If the male were to climax repeatedly within 18 hours, the volume would not be as much because the testicles have to "restock" their sperm supply for the next ejaculation. This means that untill 18 hours after one, the next ejaculations would be at a decreased quantity. The sperm is stored in the Vas Deferens located behind the testicle, not actually in the testicles. The Vas Deferens is made of smooth muscle that is able to stretch and accommodate the ejaculate volume.	2016-10-27 21:25:58Z	Tommy Woldt	1

This fish is loaded with the strong hair supporters like vitamin D and protein, and it also contains omega-3 fatty acids that promote hair growth by keeping your scalp healthy. A win-win. Yellow peppers
Yellow bell peppers have nearly five and a half times more vitamin C than oranges (341 milligrams, as opposed to 63). This is very good news for your locks—vitamin C is an antioxidant that strengthens the hair shaft and hair follicles, as well as prevents breakage. Oysters
Zinc deficiency has been known to cause hair loss and poor scalp conditions, and oysters are loaded with zinc—just three ounces contains 493-percent of your daily value. But not just any oysters will do: Steer clear of the ones caught in the Gulf of Mexico, which may contain unusually high levels of Cadmium due to the 2010 BP oil spill. Eggs
Eggs are an excellent source of those aforementioned omega-3s, and they are also contain biotin (which many people trying to grow their hair take in supplement form). But be aware: It’s not the “healthier” egg white that will make your hair long and beautiful, it’s the yolk. Eating too many egg whites can actually block the absorption of biotin into the body, causing a depletion of this micronutrient. Sunflower seeds

9724	9732	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9732	There is currently no biological mechanism that would increase a cell's absorption of oxygen in conditions of low SpO2 (unless you're a mutant). The amount taken by the cell is based on the amount of oxygen rich blood cells that reach the outer walls of the capillary to be permeated through and deliver oxygen. So this means that the cells have no way to just grab more oxygen when they don't have enough. The oxygen they get is what is available to them. Now the next part I'm not sure about, but I can give you a theory. When SpO2 goes below 88%, it may cause a failure in which the lungs can no longer support themselves with oxygen because they themselves don't have any to work (to be more exact, the diaphragm).

(The lungs get more air, the bronchia get wider, you can breathe freely) Today, I only get problems breathing when I am really sick, and even then (when I can't breathe through my nose) it does not necessaryly occur. If you have some concerns about wheter you really should start exercising or your asthma gets worse because of it, you have to visit the doctor and ask for an individual check. I would start exercising and doing something for my stamina. You need to keep doing it regularly to achieve some results. Sometime you will get to the point that you are able to really train hard without having any serious problems anymore.	2016-10-19 19:14:00Z	Harmless Psycho	1

It changes rapidly, and whatever a doctor was taught 20 years ago in med school, or even 10 years ago at a conference, may not be true today. So if they're not keeping up, they're going to be ignorant on some issues. I've seen that myself more than once with my own doctors. In some ways it's easier for specialists. They can focus their continuing ed on their one narrow specialty. If you walk into a cardiologist's office and ask about your rash, he'll just wave you off down the hall to the dermatologist. But a GP can't do that. They have to remain abreast of the whole spectrum. They have to be able to recognize and diagnose -- or at least suspect and refer to a specialist -- pretty much every disease, disorder, allergy, rash, psych issue, pregnancy issue, STD, sex problem, weird bump on my tongue, and of course whiny made-up complaints. So it should come as no surprise when patients like you, who suffer from a certain disease and therefore know more about it than most doctors, encounter one whose knowledge is outdated and no longer correct. Your knowledge of the subject is ahead of theirs, so I would recommend smiling, saying good day, and finding another doctor.	2016-10-19 04:10:06Z	Carey Gregory	2

These may include (along with some associated symptoms): Note that all of these symptoms are extremely non-specific and   have causes that are much more common than those listed above, e.g. the overwhelming majority of patients with headaches   abdominal pain   shortness of breath do not have lupus, since those are all symptoms commonly experienced by the general population.

A NTI (or similar) anterior splint only covers your front teeth so there would be less of problem with dry mouth. If it is a mouth guard, it will be too thick and uncomfortable to wear to sleep. Using dry mouth solutions/gels may help with your dry mouth. You could also look at the causes of your grinding. If it only occurred in the last few years, the likely cause is stress related. You could also look at orthodontic correction of your occlusion (how your teeth come together). This can help but there is no guarantee with the result, so you could spend lots of money and get no improvement. I could go on and on about this topic. If you can not tolerate any splint (guard) at all, you can build up your canine teeth if possible to "protect" other teeth from wear to some extent. Beyond that it is very difficult to solve this problem and will result in long term wear and damage to your teeth. Hope this helps.

Excessive intake of sugar can cause a lot of health issues like hypertension, diabetes, obesity and other lifestyle diseases. That is why that sugar-free diets are being promoted worldwide. 
What is sugar?   is typically a combination of glucose and fructose. Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food.  The most   soft drinks, cakes, pies, chocolate, fruit drinks and desserts. Just a single can of cola can contain up to 7 tsp of added sugar, while an average-sized chocolate bar can contain up to 6 tsp.  The fact that our body actually needs a certain amount of glucose to function - primarily the brain - which is the biggest consumer of glucose. All fruits and vegetables contain varying amounts of sugar in the form of natural fructose, so  , is not only near impossible but actually unhealthy, as this would mean avoiding all fruits and vegetables. And according to MedicalNewstoday "Cutting all sugar from your diet would be very difficult to achieve. Fruits, vegetables, dairy products and dairy replacements, eggs, alcohol and nuts all contain sugar, which would leave you with little other than meat and fats to eat - definitely not very healthy." According to   director of Sugar Nutrition UK "Like all sources of calories, sugars can be consumed within a healthy, balanced diet and active lifestyle," and "Sugars can often help to make certain nutritious foods more palatable, which can promote variety in a healthy, balanced diet." So, in short, having a   could be the most appropriate method to be healthy even if we include sugar(reduce intake, avoid added sugar and focus on sugar from fruits and vegetables) to our diet.	2016-12-08 07:11:12Z	Kate Forsyth	2

I do the same. I avoid sugar as much as I can, for example cake, coke, etc - like you explained, too. It does indeed have a positive effect on your health. Most of the sugar we eat these days are industrial made. That isn't healthy at all and it is even the reason for many 'modern' problems such as diabetes or adiposity. Many people think they have to avoid fat to lose weight and live more healthy, but that is wrong. We need to avoid the sugar, which we are mostly consuming way too much. Therefore, your friend is living a really good example, which everyone should try to follow. Because we eat too much sugar, the sugar gets turned into fat - not the fat (of course, it is the same here: industrial made fat is as bad as the industrial made sugar). We should all stick to the healthy sugar (and fat), like in apples or bananas. That way we get all the sugar we need. The most healthy method of eating is the 'back to nature method'. Stick to organic food and you will get only the healthy sugar that you need.  In general, proteins and fat are the most important nutrients! You don't have to worry about getting fat because of eating fat - the body gets used to it and burns fat much more effectively as a result. My experience of consuming no cake, coke and candy is that I feel more free and easy. I don't miss it at all - I even feel bad when I still eat a piece of cake. Of course, it is okay if you eat some chocolate once in a while, but you could for example only eat bitter(sweet) chocolate, which is even healthy and also really tasty. You will get used to such a lifestyle soon - and yes, it definetely has a very positive effect on your health.	2016-10-12 06:14:24Z	Harmless Psycho	1

It is a very common procedure, which, depending on the countries, may be done by physicians, nurses or radiology assistants. A transvaginal ultrasound consists of an ultrasound probe inserted (after ultrasound gel is applied on it) into the vaginal cavity. Patients undergoing this procedure describe it as non painful. It is the same sensation as when a speculum is inserted in the vagina to do a pap smear. Using these criteria might help differentiating benign masses with malignant masses. Here some examples: Additionally, the IOTA group has even described some features and rules which should orient towards a benign or malignant cause: If doubt persist, some indications in the personal history or other clinical examination (+/- biomarkers) might help providing additional evidence in favor of a benign or malignant cause.

Clean the burn gently with soap and water.
DO NOT break blisters, doing so will lead to infection.
You may put a thin layer of ointment, such as petroleum jelly or aloe vera, on the burn. The ointment does not need to have antibiotics in it. Some antibiotic ointments can cause an allergic reaction. DO NOT use cream, lotion, oil, cortisone, butter, or egg white.
If needed, protect the burn from rubbing and pressure with a sterile non-stick gauze (petrolatum or Adaptic-type) lightly taped or wrapped over it. DO NOT use a dressing that can shed fibers, because they can get caught in the burn. Change the dressing once a day.

The reduction of polyphenols seems to vary among different brands according to   so it might be worthwile to try several brands before you come to a conclusion. Another approach might be to try tea with milk, since milk proteins precipitate tannins.

I speculate that most people would prefer to have foot CPR and risk fractures/pneumothorax in order to not (almost certainly) die. However this part of the discussion would perhaps belong better in philosophy.se; I would be very interested to see a if there is a good argument for   doing it, or a discussion of litigation vs Good Samaritan laws.

How much mass you gain and how quickly depends on how you work out,  and also on your genetic make up. Some people gain muscle easier than others. 
There is a lot of very good information online. Simply google it and follow some of the excellent guides that are out there. Look up what exercises are the best for what you want,  how many repetition you should aim for etc. You can also ask for a personal trainer at the gym to create a plan for you.
My general advice to you is; whatever you choose, stick to it. Gaining muscle - just like losing weight - is a long process and you will not see results overnight. Think of a tangible goal (gain 5 kgs, squat 50 kgs etc) and work toward getting there, step at a time. Good luck!	2016-10-02 11:16:24Z	Mal	0

If needed the ISF it's helpful the make some corrections to the Blood Sugar level, even before the meal, to be added to the normal amount of insulin.
For example for a 150gr meal of rice (28gr carbs/100gr) and with a I:C ratio of 1u:10gr, you will need 4.2 units of insulin to compensate the meal.

Yet, even here, weight lost is mostly due to the fact that you control eating: It is much harder to overeat in 8 hours than in 16. A good way to check that you aren't underfeeding yourself is to count calories and sum up per-week what you have eaten vs what your TDEE says you need. Pair that with your personal data for weight delta over the week and you can adjust your calorie intake appropriately.

Now the general functioning of the body is that it produces acid naturally and not the bases(alkaline substances) so you usually would have heard people that they are facing acidity problems and no one says anytime that they have basic/alkalinity problems, so when you drink tea/coffee on the day of the fast, you tend to catalyse the process of the formation of acid and you don't eat anything on the day of fasting, so make sure that you don't drink tea/coffee on the day of fasting.

The sodium triphosphate that's in your chicken is technically a preservative. However, sodium triphosphate preserves the meat by retaining water, slowing down the drying process.  Sodium triphosphate itself is  , I think the limits on the quantity that you can add are present mainly because it can be used to cheaply increase the weight of meat/fish.

My reasoning goes as follows: The only significant difference between skin on one's face and elsewhere is the higher concentration of   that secrete oil, but since this lotion is clearly based on oils or fatty alcohols intended to replace or supplement the same oils anyway, I don't see that as significant.  However, a mixture of oils with a thick consistency applied (accidentally) to the eye's tear film would likely cause strong irritation. I'd interpret the instructions as "be really careful if applying this on your face; you   don't want it in your eyes". I don't know whether skin in under-3-year-olds is significantly different somehow, but the wording does make me think of the usual "don't let your kid eat it" caveat. 	2016-10-20 16:12:31Z	Anko	1
9364	9371	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9371	Definitely agree with you, it's a silly thing and different test inspectors have different ideology.  My advice is to not worry about the results of the "paper tests" (I know it's annoying) and focus on it's practicality. They make changes to the so called "guidelines" every few years, as if the past guidelines were "inferior" or "not up to date". Here's an interesting thing to think about.    Is CPR best given using the ABC method? In the past, we were taught Airway, Breathing, Compression. Now "new" guidelines are vouching for CAB because people are afraid of mouth to mouth contact, but are ok with compressing. Which allows the blood (with lower % oxygen:hemoglobin ratio) to circulate the body.  What about if there is 2 people? does the ratio change? If the ratios do change, it makes you question just how arbitrary these numbers are.  At the end of the day, tests are tests, and real word is real word. I worked in the hospital and my co-worker was accused by the patient's family members of "not compressing fast enough." As if he was not "passionate" enough in saving a patient's life. Poor lad had to fill out more "paperwork". Good luck, the medical industry really sucks the energy out of you.  In reference to Uptodate, the essential goals for performing excellent chest compressions include: 
●Maintain the rate of chest compression at 100 to 120 compressions per minute 
●Compress the chest at least 5 cm (2 inches) but no more than 6 cm (2.5 inches) with each down-stroke 
●Allow the chest to recoil completely after each down-stroke (it should be easy to pull a piece of paper from between the rescuer's hand and the patient's chest just before the next down-stroke)
●Minimize the frequency and duration of any interruptions	2016-09-26 05:28:05Z	辛祐賦 hsinyofu	-1

The quantity, however, that you intend to use is much larger. Even though you probably intend to use it over a prolonged period of time, not at once, the fact that chlorhexidine is not intended to be ingested remains. Edit: As rumtscho has pointed out in comments the tax may be significantly lower because the liquid might contain other ingredient(s) that make it unsafe to drink.

The Doctors were able to incise/cut out the bite site and take a syringe and suck out the venom/blister/pus that was festering underneath. They applied antibiotic cream over that and bandaged it up. They swabbed it and are running a culture test on it to know which medications are best to treat this. They think they got all of it, but want to make sure it didn't enter my bloodstream, etc.  Apparently during the fall, the Hobo Spiders are extremely aggressive/active at night as it is their mating season and while their bite is not always venomous (it depends whether they inject it at the time), sometimes it is, and in this case it was. The symptoms of a Hobo Spider bite are akin to a Brown Recluse, although not as a potent. But the wound site does take several months to recover/heal completely and will probably leave a scar.  If the bite is venomous or it just becomes infected, it can become pretty serious, especially for those with poor immune systems.  So just be aware of the Hobo Spider if you are in the Pacific Northwest!  Or if you are concerned about any spider bite, just speak to your physician -- don't hesitate. 	2016-09-25 21:22:38Z	Pills N Pillows	4

9355	9718	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9718	I think your question would be better worded as, "can I get an infection after receiving the flu shot?" Since a secondary infection would imply that you had an infection in the first place.  Your question is not uncommon, and many people hesitate to receive it again after experiencing what you are describing.  Some patients do report very mild flu-like symptoms after receiving the flu vaccine via a shot, but the symptoms are much more common with the nasal spray. Symptoms may include feeling sleepy, light cough from throat irritation, achy, headache, tired, mild fever, joint point. However, these symptoms are not due to infection, the symptoms are from your immune system reacting to the dead virus particles (eww) to the vaccine. I'm not making this up, it's called the inflammatory response. The inflammatory response symptoms are GOOD, though, because it means your immune system is doing its job like it is supposed to.  Once your immune system has been in contact with these dead virus particles it will have learned how to combat those strains of viruses in the future. Your system begins to make what are called antibodies, which are what protect you in case you do come in contact with a live virus. In fact, these antibodies are called ig-M, the M actually stands for memory, neat huh? Your white blood cells will actually remember those strains of virus and easily destroy them on contact. So when and if you actually come in contact with the flu, your white blood cells will be ready to do their job very quickly.   It is certainly possible to get sick during any period of time before or after receiving the flu vaccine. Your body takes several weeks to build immunity to the flu virus after receiving the flu vaccine. It is still possible to contract the flu during that period. In fact, it is possible to contract the flu even after your body achieves immunity, because the flu virus changes constantly even within 1 flu season. The advantage to the vaccine is that if you do happen to get sick, the flu will not be as severe since you will have extra antibodies to begin with.   The bottom line is that it is your body and you know it best. If you have concerns I would certainly recommend seeing a physician.	2016-10-23 05:57:14Z	MC RN	0

If you are new to caffeine supplements then the usual recommended start is with a 100mg dose ( . Typically, 200mg of caffeine is used for fat-burning supplementation (impact is still being discussed in scientific community), while acute strength increases occur at higher doses, 500mg and above (again, still under discussion). Researchers tend to use a dosage range of 4-6mg/kg bodyweight. The structure is the same but its easier to take more than you are used to if you measure wrong. I would   suggest you   and go for   if you are set on reducing intake through less coffee.   Caffeine is highly stimulatory and a systemic vasoconstrictor. Caution should be exerted if one is either not used to caffeine ingestion or currently has high blood pressure. Caffeine should not be used as a supplement in those with cardiac impairments without prior consultation of one's doctor. Caffeine can also have an effect on ones quality of sleep; while you may be able to fall asleep, it will be of inferior quality.  Habitual caffeine use leads to tolerance. This means the effects of caffeine will be diminished, often to the point where the only benefit a user experiences is caffeine’s anti-sleep effect. This is an ‘insurmountable’ tolerance, which means more caffeine will not overcome it.  .	2016-09-15 13:22:23Z	JJosaur	2
9312	10532	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10532	Question: Why the Daily Amount of food from each group does match up to the weekly recommended amounts? Answer: The daily amount is for calories, which means that for individuals who consume 1,000 Cal per day (every day, so 7,000 Cal per week), Guidelines recommend 1/2 cups of dark green vegetables per week. Calories are listed as per day, because people usually know how much calories they consume per day not per week. Foods are per week to show that you do not need to eat them every single day. The Daily Value (DV) is an estimated amount of a nutrient a sedentary person (who spends about 2,000 Calories per day) needs per day. For a certain food, the DV of a nutrient is expressed in percents of total daily needs for that nutrient. Example: According to ( , the Daily Value for iron (for someone who spends 2K Calories per day) is 18 mg per day.   (NutritionData) contains 0.8 grams of iron, which is 5% of the daily value for this person. If you are more active and spend, for example, 3,000 Calories per day, your Daily Value would be 3/2 of the Daily Value from that chart, so, for iron, 18 mg x 3/2 = 27 mg of iron. In this case, 30 grams of spinach would give you only 2/3 of the 5%, that is 3.3% of DV of iron. My comment on the chart the OP has pasted in the question: If you want at least nearly accurate results, you need to check the Daily Value for an exact food and not just a "food group." Spinach and lettuce are both "vegetables" but contain very different amounts of iron.	2016-12-19 18:15:38Z	Jan	1

9237	9239	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9239	The average bowel transit time - the time needed for a food to travel from mouth to stool - in a healthy person is probably around 12-14 hours. Source:  When a certain food or nutrient (lactose, fructose) irritates the bowel, the bowel transit time can be much shorter and it could very well be just 2-3 hours. But abdominal pain, gas or loose stools in IBS can appear even faster than that concluded from the bowel transit time, for example as soon as 15 minutes after a meal. This is because the stool and gas you excrete does not come from your last meal but more likely from your previous meals. It is gastrocolic reflex that causes the movements of your large intestine, when the food reaches your stomach. This is why breakfast helps to have a bowel movement in the morning. Apples and mangoes are high in "net fructose," which means they contain more fructose than glucose. When a person has less symptoms after removing foods high in net fructose from the diet, it means he can have fructose malabsorption (FM), which is described in detail here  . Foods high in   (to avoid in FM): apples, pears, mangoes, agave, watermelon, honey, beverages sweetened by high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), carambola, feijoa, nance, guava, grapes (for more detailed list see the link above). Additionally, a person with FM can have gas and loose stools after eating foods high in   and other sugar alcohols (polyols), such as   which can be found in "sugar-free" chewing gum, certain low-calorie drinks, prunes, grapes, sweet cherries, apricots and peaches. Additionally, a person with FM can get gas after eating foods high in   Jerusalem artichokes, red onions and bananas. NOTE, that not all foods high in fructose should be avoided, but only foods high in "net fructose" (described in the above link). If a person who has fructose malabsorption as the only or main gastrointestinal problem, eliminates foods with nutrients marked in bold above, he should see an obvious improvement within   and more improvement within a week. After improvement, a person can try to introduce certain less suspicious foods back (but only one food in 48 hours to be able to identify eventual symptoms). A person who has FM, often has a slight problem in absorbing lactose due to   lactose intolerance, so it can help if he avoids milk, curd, yogurt, ice cream (cheese and butter should be fine). Elimination of all nutrients mentioned above at once is called a  . So, when someone thinks he has FM, he can start with a low-fructose diet or a bit more thorough low-FODMAP diet. People who have FM often think they have IBS. If one wants to be officially diagnosed, he can ask a gastroenterologist to perform a "hydrogen breath test with fructose." The condition is usually life-long. Fructose malabsorption should not be confused with a rare hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), which can cause much more severe symptoms after consumption of even minute amounts of fructose. Disclaimer: I did not diagnosed anyone here with FM, but this post can help people who have IBS-like symptoms (gas, loose stools, vague abdominal pains).

B vitamins are found in whole unprocessed foods. Processed carbohydrates such as sugar/white flour tend to have lower B vitamin than their unprocessed counterparts. For this reason, it is required by law in many countries (including the United States) that the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid be added back to white flour after processing. This is sometimes called "Enriched Flour" on food labels. Good sources for B vitamins include legumes (pulses or beans), whole grains, potatoes, bananas, chili peppers, tempeh, nutritional yeast, brewer's yeast, and molasses. You can find this information by reading the labels of these products.  The B12 vitamin is of note because it is not available from plant products, making B12 deficiency a legitimate concern for vegans. However, manufacturers of plant-based foods will sometimes report B12 content, leading to confusion about what sources yield B12. The confusion arises because the standard US Pharmacopeia (USP) method for measuring the B12 content does not measure the B12 directly. Instead, it measures a bacterial response to the food. Chemical variants of the B12 vitamin found in plant sources are active for bacteria, but cannot be used by the human body. This same phenomenon can cause significant over-reporting of B12 content in other types of foods as well. Because B-vitamins are water soluble and readily excreted if they are over complimented.	2016-09-14 08:38:36Z	JJosaur	0

It's been shown through studies, using a peak-flow meter can determine whether you're in serious trouble or not and essentially "wait it out". The numbers vary from doctor to doctor, however though a seasoned asthmatic generally knows when it's time to either visit the hospital or use their inhaler.  That pretty much sums it up. They also cite the doctor's name so you can look more up on his studies. 
Basically to put it bluntly, there are a million variables that come into play with something as delicate as asthma. That link below cites the doctor that conducted a study similar to what you're asking and also wrote some of the material.

The idea is that the person is allergic to a large number of diverse things and is eating   allergenic every day. By wildly restricting the diet, two things will happen.  First, the rash or other symptoms will calm down and heal, the patient's discomfort will be lessened dramatically, and the patient will probably sleep better and become "healthier" with the pressure of the symptoms off. Second, a baseline will be established to which other foods can be added. The patient can add their most important food first (eg everything I make has onions, let's find out if onions make me break out in a rash) or foods they believe are safe based on past experience.  You should   consider doing this without a doctor's support and advice. Over the matter of a week or two, I wouldn't worry about vitamin deficiencies, but discuss with your doctor whether supplements are a good idea. Protein is a bigger thing, so talk to your doctor about why there is no meat in the plan. You will get a little from the rice, but probably not enough. Eggs and dairy are things many people are allergic to, so I can see excluding those, but as I've mentioned the people I know who were put on this diet were typically told to eat lamb as part of it. It is definitely a short term thing that you can retreat to when you are seemingly reacting to everything and your health feels out of control. Don't assume that anyone who suggests it is a quack. But don't assume that it's a safe way to live your life or that you should keep eating that way once your symptoms have subsided. Page 25 of   lists a number of studies on elimination diets in general. It is focused on eliminating things, and doesn't bring the patient down to just two foods, though. 	2016-09-16 17:09:07Z	Kate Gregory	3

To understand what is going on, one has to know that dentine is a highly organised structure composed of thousands of tubules (microscopic channels). These spaces are occupied by air, fluid or the extremities of odontoblasts, cells that produced the dentin, which are at the periphery of the pulp chamber, the center of the tooth. The nerves in the middle of the tooth are only capable of transmitting information about pain and are unable to discriminate between the various causes. One of the most accepted theories to explain dentine sensitivity was  . The pain is caused by the movement of fluid in the tubules due to changes in temperature and pressure. Pressure on the tooth or a hot stimulus cause the fluid to expand inwards and compress the odontoblasts and nerves in the middle of the tooth. Prolonged drying or a cold stimulus causes the water in the tubules to contract outwards (toward the stimulus), which causes a suction of the odontoblasts into the tubules which in turn pull on the nerves in the middle of the tooth, again causing discomfort or pain. Lastly, over-the-counter analgesics (painkillers) will not be very effective at preventing the pain, and more powerful ones will only mask the pain temporarily. Use of special toothpaste to block the tubules and desensitise the nerves can work, but an examination by an oral health professional will make sure that there is truly no other factors at play.

Enemas are not harmless and unless there's constipation they have no benefits. And even then they shouldn't be used routinely. There are safer, healthier ways to manage constipation. I'll also assume you're sure you're using the device correctly, that it doesn't have some sort of valve that is blocking flow. That said, it sounds like you're simply not inserting it far enough. The tip needs to go 2-3 inches into the rectum to get past the anal sphincter. One inch isn't enough. You need to use some lubricant on the tip, preferably something water-based. Your local pharmacy should have a number of choices. But in a pinch you can use stuff like Vaseline, or even a plain vegetable oil such as olive oil.

It looks a little like this: A quick analysis says that if you follow that diet exactly and not pile on sauce onto your dinner then you will lose weight as your calories out > calories in.  You are cutting out protein and fats to lose weight which can work but is not optimal.

9146	9184	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9184	Your diet will yield poor results. As JJosaur analysis points out, it only contains 1150 Kcal, the amount of vitamins and minerals is quite poor. You also need to eat enough protein as JJosaur has pointed out. What you eat during the entire day is less than what I eat during dinner alone (1800 Kcal) and I weigh less than you (55 kg). Losing weight via dieting only works well when you are overweight by a large margin. So, if you want to lose 20 kg or more, then eating a lot less will work quite well, you'll then get plenty of energy from your fat reserves for your energy needs. But if you don't have this huge excess of fat reserves, if your goal is to reduce a BMI of, say 22 kg/m^2 to 20 kg/m^2, then eating a lot less than your energy needs won't work well, you'll become fatigued, your body will take measures to conserve energy and minerals, these are then not available to build up and maintain physical fitness. We have bodies that evolved over hundreds of millions of years, our bodies are programmed via feedback mechanisms mediated by hormones that regulate the metabolic rate, muscle mass etc., the whole point of all this is to enhance the chances of survival given the situation we are in. But, the programming will assume typical prehistoric conditions.  Since your diet amounts to putting your body through a mild famine condition, your body will have made changes to be able to deal with such a condition better the next time. This means that you're likely to regain your old weight on the long term, if not more and your body composition will have changed, you'll have more fat and less muscle. Your basal metabolic rate will have gone down.  I lost weight without intending to do so from about 63 kg to 55 kg by exercising and eating more. I now eat about 3800 Kcal/day and I run for about an hour per day. I only eat healthy foods (whole grains, brown rice, lots of fruits and vegetables). The more I started to exercise and the more I started to eat, the more minerals and vitamins I got in.  Now, running for an hour per day and then eating a lot, is a routine that in a prehistoric setting would correspond to having to work hard to get enough to eat. The body then adapts to deal with this sort of a situation better, that's why I became fitter and stronger. I also lost weight because fat reserves are useless ballast when having to run a lot. So, I would suggest that you gradually increase your energy expenditure and energy intake. You should eat a lot more carbs in the forms of whole grains and brown rice. This is because energy from carbs can be more easily used for cardio work. Carbohydrate molecules contain more oxygen atoms in them compared to fat molecules, so they require less oxygen to be burned compared to fat.	2016-09-10 22:29:54Z	Count Iblis	2

Clinicians have long used the expression “lines gained” or lines lost” to indicate changes in visual ability.  The Visual Acuity Score (VAS) provides a convenient scale to estimate visual abilities.  On this scale 20/20 is rated as 100; on charts with a logarithmic progression each line is worth 5 points and each letter read is 1 point.  50 VAS points stand for 20/200; it is reasonable to estimate that at this level the average person has lost 50% of visual ability. Zero is reached for 20/2000, a level at which it is difficult to speak about visual acuity, since 100x magnification is needed for detail recognition. In the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (5th and 6th edition) the VAS scale is used in the calculation of visual disability.

9095	9098	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9098	To make it simple: There are two types of fat: unsaturated ("good fat") and saturated and trans fat ("bad fat"). Current dietary guidelines (American Heart Association, WHO) suggest that saturated fats should be limited to <10% (5-6% for those who would benefit from lowering of LDL cholesterol), and trans fats to <1% of energy or as low as possible. The main purpose of these restrictions is to reduce risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. WebMD ( ) provides an exhaustive list, where unsaturated and saturated fat can be found: Interestingly a recent meta-analysis published (aggregation and synthetising of different studies) in the BMJ  ( ) has somehow questioned the "negative effect" of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease. But considering that their results were associated with a high heterogeneity (= how consistent the effect across the combined studies is, ie in this case low), larger studies are needed to confirm their results. To your question: I have not found any study comparing directly different "good fat" oils together, so probably, considering one of the oils which contains unsaturated fat would be a wise choise (if you respect the dietary guidelines).

9095	12733	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12733	No cooking oils at all should be used. While saturated fats are very unhealthy as pointed out in M. Arrowsmith's answer, there is a problem with using unsaturated oils as well. We should first note that there is no need to fry food, you can steam or boil your food, and add whole foods containing fats like avocados, walnuts, and chia seeds. There are no proven nutritional health benefits of frying foods in refined oils over a plant based diet that includes all the fats in the form of the above mentioned whole foods.   Conversely, we know from many observational studies that diets that include cooking oils in any form are worse w.r.t. atherosclerosis compared to plant based diets in which no or very small amounts of cooking oils are used. Such diets do contain some amount of fat, this comes mainly from nuts, seeds and certain oily vegetables like avocados. A very recent   reported: Other such results had been obtained previously in other indigenous or rural populations who stick to a low fat diet containing a lot of fruits and vegetables and who get a lot of physical activity. But in the Tsimané study, research have been able to bring CT scanners to the remote locations where the  Tsimané live to directly measure coronary artery calcium scores, while the older studies used more indirect methods. E.g. as  The article goes on to link the differences to the differences in cholesterol level which is then argued to be due to the differences in the percentage of calories coming from oils, it was 30–45% in the Asian community while 10-15% in the African community. Note that the Tsimané also get 14% of their calories from fats. Then having established that a low fat diet and a generally healthy lifestyle that includes eating lots of vegetables and getting plenty of exercise yields a low rates of heart disease in indigenous populations, one also needs to consider how other indigenous populations fare who eat a high fat diet. E.g. there exists a popular myth about Eskimos having very low rates of heart disease despite eating a high fat, meat based diet containing hardly any fruits and vegetables. But as  So, the known facts on heart disease prevalence and diets in different populations paints a clear picture: using cooking oils is done at your own peril. But what about using only the healthy unsaturated oils, surely we can evade problems by using, say, olive oil?  The main problem with this is that  you're going to eat much more oil than the typical 10 to 15% of the natural intake that is seen in indigenous populations that are free of heart disease. This especially in case of a 90 year old grandmother as mentioned in the OP's question whose energy intake and use will be quite low. A few tablespoons of oil will already get you over this limit which makes frying food quite difficult. But why would that be a problem? The problem is due to the "empty calories effect", the larger the fraction of the oil of the total energy intake, the less room will be left for energy in the form of whole grain carbs such as brown rice, whole grain bread and whole grain pasta. Even if you use the most healthy oils known like olive oil, the more you use of such oils the more you're going to miss out on the health benefits of the whole grain carbs. These health benefits come from not only the vitamins and minerals in whole grain carbs, but also from the fibers.  Fibers are converted in the intestines by gut bacteria to short chained fatty acids (SCFAs) which the body uses for a whole host of things. It has been shown that SCFAs  . Besides whole grains, whole foods that contain fats such as walnuts and chia seeds also contain a lot of useful nutrients including fibers. We have to note here that   Indigenous populations like the Tsimané get more than twice the recommended amounts (I checked this from my own diet which is similar to what the Tsimané eat), suggesting that the recommended amount is way too low. A 20 year-old may then be able to boost fiber intake while still using using significant amounts of cooking oils, but what about a sedentary 90 year old? In summary, cooking oils have no health benefits, we don't need to use them. Using the healthier unsaturated oils is not a good option either compared to not using any cooking oils, because you're going to get less nutrients as a result. This is going to be more of a problem the older and less physically active you are. 	2017-06-23 01:55:27Z	Count Iblis	1

9052	9527	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9527	Having done more searching over the last month, I thought it might be helpful to others if I answered my own question. I came to three realizations: First, this is like asking, "Dear Google, when am I going to die?" It's impossible to know for sure and it's unnerving to even ask. Second, searching for "older people with cerebral palsy" on the internet is a tricky proposition. Suppose that a person is 80 today (in 2016), and living with cerebral palsy. That means he/she was born in 1936. Would a person with a mild CP impairment even have been diagnosed as such, given the social stigma? Unlikely. Would such a person be tech savvy enough to be posting on message boards? Also unlikely. Would such a person be posting  ? Extremely unlikely. Looking for such people is like hunting for unicorns. All that said,   features several older people with CP chiming in. I also found a few scattered forum posts from people in their 60s and 70s living with CP. The oldest person I was able to find was Maureen Arcand, who   about living with CP and lived to be 86, despite considerable mobility impairments. That's actually above the current US average life expectancy of 81.6 years for women. Third, there has indeed been some research on this topic, though it can be hard to find. Hutton and Pharoah ( ) distinguish between cases with and without severe impairments, and found that in cases where there were no severe impairments (i.e., able to stand and walk, able to care for oneself, no comorbid disorders such as epilepsy), survival outcomes were similar to the general population. Strauss   ( ) found that in their highest-functioning category, survival rates were slightly reduced compared to the general population, but they go on to caution that, "if a person's pattern of disabilities is at an extreme end of the range for a given group, their life expectancy may differ substantially
from the group average." As Hutton says in  , "A child who is mildly affected by CP can expect to have much the same length of life as
a child without CP." To sum up, for those of us fortunate enough to be on the extreme mild end of the CP spectrum, all available evidence suggests that the CP itself doesn't put a drag on our lifespans. If you go to Dr. Google, you can find CP resource websites claiming that CP "puts extra strain on the heart" or that people with CP "don't build up a reserve of energy when resting". That may be true in more moderate or severe cases, but it seems to be an unlikely risk factor for mild cases. Will I live to be 101, like my grandfather has done (and, unaccountably, continues to do)? Probably not, but then, that's true for most people. Just like everyone else, I don't know how long I've got, but the research says my odds are just about as good as anyone else's.	2016-10-06 20:05:16Z	jdobres	6

9024	13023	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13023	On a population level, women tend to have higher body fat percentage than men: 25% for normal women versus 15% for men. This means that for a man and women with equally-sized abs, the man's abs will look more prominent because they have less fat on top of them.  Another contributing factor is that men put on muscle more easily than women do. This isn't sexism, it's biological fact due to the actions of testosterone to build muscle. If a man and a woman exercise for the same amount of time and the same intensity, the man will build more muscle because he has about 3x as much testosterone as the woman, and androgens (including testosterone) increase muscle growth. (This is why some body builders take "steroids": to boost their muscle growth.)  So, in summary, the reason men develop "more abs" is because they have lower body fat and can build muscle more easily. This is of course ON AVERAGE...there are plenty of men who have no visible abs and plenty of women with impressive 6-packs. Any individual through proper diet and exercise can develop good-looking abs regardless of their gender.	2017-07-19 15:18:55Z	veritessa	1

This test is done at a specialty lab and takes several weeks for the results to come back.  You get your blood draw in the usual place (e.g. your local hospital), but then the sample is sent out to a specialty lab.  This is a relatively non-invasive test.  You can put EMLA cream on the inside of a child's elbow and there will be no pain for the blood draw. An individual with insulin resistance can do this test between once and four times a year, to track progress (or lack thereof).  The lower the result, the more insulin resistant you are.  For example, my son, who has been diagnosed with insulin resistance, has varied between 4 and 20 (I forget what the units are).  When he was at 4, we were seeing more symptoms and higher BMI for age.  When he was at 16 things were better.  At 20, better still.  I'm afraid I'm not certain what range is considered normal -- but I vaguely remember 20 and above was good. There are a number of articles out there about this.  Here's one:

This can lead to a rapid drop in blood pressure and heart rate and may result in fainting. If you loose consciousness from this, it is known as a vasovagal syncope episode. The act of bearing down in this way is known as the Valsalva maneuver (which does actually have a purpose in cardiology*). This information came from  , similar information can be found on the Mayo Clinic's website (I didn't include it because it was a bit chopped-up). From what I have read, bearing down isn't good for your head if you have a known brain aneurysm.

If you would like more information on this, please visit the  . *The Valsalva Maneuver is used as a treatment for a variety of conditions as well as a diagnostic tool for them (listed below). The maneuver's mechanism occurs when a person bears down and holds their breath. When this happens, pressure in the chest cavity increases and venous return decreases. This results in a very rapid decrease in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. It is because of this rapid decrease both in HR and BP that can cause dizziness or syncope not only when purposely preforming this maneuver but also when you are on the toilet.  The Valsalva Maneuver is used to treat SVT (SupraVentricular Tachycardia), traditional tachycardia (high heart rate), tachypnea (high respiratory rate), and A-Fib (Atrial Fibrillation) among others.

But not all of these people can be treated, there are cases where angioplasty of a bypass cannot be performed. Such patients have a bad prognosis, they have a very high probability of suffering another heart attack in the near future. Dr. Esselstyn has been experimenting with a very strict plant based, fat free diet on such hopeless patients,   with what he claims are good results. Now, the patients here did get medical treatment in the form of medicines, so anticoagulants, blood pressure medication, nitrates, statins etc. would all be administered where appropriate. Nevertheless, without the lifestyle changes imposed by sticking to Esselstyn's diet, most of his patients would have lived for no more than a few years, dying directly from another heart attack or from heart failure caused by subsequent heart attacks. Now, this does not mean that we should all stick to Esselstyn's diet. More rigorous tests are needed to verify his claimed results. Also, even if verified, an intervention that can prevent a death from some cause with a period of a few years may not be good for a young person who is not facing that risk at all.  Also, the short of diet Esselstyn is arguing for may lead to deficiencies on the long term if you're not very careful about your nutrient intake. Compare this to taking aspirin. If you somehow know that you're going to have a heart attack in the near future, you'll be able to reduce the probability of getting that heart attack simply by taking an aspirin. But if you don't have that information, then taking an aspirin just in case will not help you to increase your life expectancy, because it increases the probability of a fatal intestinal bleeding, while the reduction of the probability of having a heart attack is going to have a lesser effect in this case.	2017-06-28 02:26:38Z	Count Iblis	0

I don't know your case and why Lyrica (=pregabalin) or Cymbalta (=duloxetine) have been suggested by your physician. Some studies suggest that both pregabalin and duloxetine can be used as second line treatment in arthritis-related pain. All above mentioned treatment should be started by a health professional as most of them need close monitoring and blood/radiological tests before some of these drugs are started. I would suggest following website, which contains very useful information for patients with lupus:

It found that metformin did not significantly alter the body's hormonal response to hypoglycemia in their study population. It looks like according to the study that recurring hypoglycemia can cause a lowering of cortisol: This may have been partially misconstrued; since metformin helps lower blood glucose, and low blood glucose is associated with decreased cortisol levels, one could assume that metformin could in theory lower cortisol levels, but this does not seem to be the case at least according to this study. Metformin works by decreasing the absorption of glucose, decreasing the amount of glucose the liver produces, and by improving insulin sensitivity. It does not directly stimulate insulin release or mimic the actions of insulin; therefore it is not linked to much hypoglycemia. When checking interactions between hydrocortisone (cortisol as a medication) and metformin the only interaction reported was: cortisol may decrease the effect of metformin and other anti-diabetic agents.	2016-08-23 17:34:32Z	Lucky	1

Arterial punctures can also be used for establishing an arterial line in a large artery such as the femoral.

Several pharmacological studies have shown that diphenhydramine crosses the blood brain barrier and produces CNS sedation. Two studies have (partly) addressed your question regarding the loss in sedation efficacy over time. Both studies focused on daytime sleepiness (as this one of the side effects which prevents prescription of diphenhydramine in patients with allergic rhinitis) but the mechanisms of tolerance can probably be extended to diphenhydramine use against insomnia. Three possible mechanisms for the tolerance to diphenhydramine were suggested in the literature: behavioural adaptation (only if diphenhydramine was taken during the day for allergic rhinitis); (2) altered drug metabolism, e.g., increased clearance; or (3) altered neuropharmacological effect.

If you dig into the existing research, unless you are looking to experience some confirmation bias one way or the other, you will only continue to find evidence that there is no conclusion. In this case  , emphasis mine: I'd love to quote the whole "Research" section here, but if you read through it, and between the lines, you can start to get an inkling of just how all over the place and inconclusive research has been. For example, the citation for the "randomized controlled studies have been encouraged" bit is simply a paper from 2011 that concludes with "these results highlight the need for more case-control studies or randomized controlled clinical trials to further examine this relationship." In other words, as recently as 5 years ago, at least one researcher was still in the state of realizing that randomized trials may be needed to clear things up. Every credible source, e.g. Johns Hopkins, periodically releases some article that says "In a recent study, vitamins have shown to be beneficial / unhelpful". If you dig into the methods of these studies you will likely find (very reasonable) initial bias in both directions as well as the introduction of other variables due to the selected sample set.  For example, the title of that that Johns Hopkins editorial linked to in the other answer is  . With a title like that I'm sure that research wasn't neutral to begin with (not that it was bad, it's just this is a really inconclusive topic so it's easy to interpret study results according to initial views, hence the fact that this has been an ongoing conflict for decades). The abstract of that study concludes with the absurdly inconclusive, and probably biased,   -- A sentence which I can't help but laugh at because, you know,  ? -- The issue really is so up in the air that anybody can pretty much find any data to support any viewpoint. You can pick anything you want from that abstract and use it as a basis to publish an article with a catchy headline like "The Vitamin Verdict" that supports your view either way, there is very little objectivity involved. However, there does at least seem to be a general consensus that,   they don't   (except for the couple of studies that said they do, which were countered by meta studies that said the studies said they didn't, and so on...). Note by the way this isn't really "of late", well, at least not in the US where it's been a slowly but steadily increasing trend for  . I distinctly remember having a heated conversation with somebody about this exact same topic 20 years ago. I think personal dietary and health trends are simply too varied to make any kind of general conclusion here. Perhaps they are good for some people in some situations and have no benefit for others, and every study from now until the end of time will continue to be inconclusive and unintentionally (or intentionally!) biased. 	2016-08-21 00:17:03Z	Jason C	5

However, even with high intake of fruits and vegetables, you have to consider micronutrient degradation in fresh fruits that you buy in the store. As soon as you pick a fruit/veggie, the micronutrients are starting to break down. The longer you wait to eat it, the less it will have. One way to get around this is to have your own garden and eat what you pick every day. The other way to ensure more micronutrient intake is to take a multivitamin. One thing to consider as well is that the RDA for each vitamin/mineral isn't the upper limit for positive benefits. There are more benefits to be reaped at higher intake with a lot of the vitamins/minerals. As for the links posted by Jan, the 1st one states that there is no definitive evidence either way, so nothing can be concluded. The 2nd link analyzed multivitamin users and only concluded results of the risk of heart attacks, mental decline, and cancer. That is not the main purpose of a multivitamin in the first place. If you look at the benefits of each vitamin/mineral( ) you'll see nothing about heart attacks, cancer, or mental decline. Lets see a study on these proposed benefits of each vitamin/mineral with multivitamin users vs non-users. I'm sure that would lead to different results.  Summary: Yes, they can be useful if you are not getting your daily intake of each of the vitamins/minerals. They can also provide benefits beyond the RDA for certain vitamins/minerals. Micronutrient degradation happens and can cause lower intake of micronutrients than you might expect, even with high amounts of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Take a multivitamin for the benefits of the vitamins/minerals, not to try and stop heart attacks, cancer, etc. 	2016-08-20 19:44:29Z	Milo Martinovich	4

8910	8915	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/8915	This is a subject I'm very well versed in since I've had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and atrial flutter (AFL) for a number of years and I've undergone no fewer than five ablation procedures. However, I really can't improve on M. Arrowsmith's answer. It's pretty much spot on. However, I will add some thoughts you won't easily find in published research. The optimal number of ablations is, of course, one. And for the majority of patients that's how many they'll undergo. Success rates for PAF are very high these days. However, a significant number of patients will require two, with the second one often being described as a "touch up" procedure. There are two major reasons why a second ablation is often required: First, it is very easy for the electrophysiologist (EP) to accidentally create what's known as a flutter circuit during the procedure. This usually takes the form of a tiny gap in the line of burns that are created to contain the afib. That tiny gap allows an errant signal to begin a self-perpetuating circle in the heart that causes the heart to beat very rapidly, often at about 150 beats per minute. This is atrial flutter (AFL). It's similar to AF, but unlike AF it's a very regular rhythm, and it's usually faster. Rates of 150 beats per minute are common. A second ablation to fix AFL is typically much faster and simpler than the original AF ablation. Second, the standard ablation for AF is what's known as pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). A PVI ablation procedure creates a circle of burns around the point in the left atrium where the pulmonary veins enter. Pulmonary veins are the number 1 source of errant AF signals, so burning a circle around them basically creates a "fence" that contains the errant signals and doesn't let them spread to the rest of the atria. However, there can also be isolated spots elsewhere in the atria that generate errant AF signals and those are very difficult to find. Since they're difficult to find, they can be missed during the first procedure and require a second procedure to go in and find and ablate them individually. After a second ablation, additional ablations are going to be because: Yes, they improve. With PAF the first procedure will completely stop AF symptoms for about 70-75% of all patients. A second procedure raises that number into the 90-95% range. So the chances of an ablation stopping your AF for years or even permanently are very good, but as I have learned, a small percentage of patients will not be so lucky. On the other hand, if you have longstanding, persistent AF, the success rates are not as good. With persistent AF you're looking at about a 50-60% success rate overall. 	2016-08-19 23:50:40Z	Carey Gregory	3

Finally, I don’t think it is possible to define an optimum number of ablation. Ideally, the aim is to success after the first ablation. I haven’t heard of a maximum. From my experience, if AF can’t be effectively ablated, the aim is to achieve frequency/rhythm control through optimal drug therapy until the patient in asymptomatic.	2016-08-19 18:16:02Z	M.

Once the liquid added evaporates, gets absorbed, or is removed in one way or another your eyes will feel dry again unless your eyes are able to adequately lubricate themselves. So most eye drops aren't treating any underlying cause, just the temporary symptoms of dry eye. If this is a frequent problem I'd look to see if any other medications you're taking could be causing the dry eyes as a side effect.

Sunglasses are an easy solution to your dry eye problem because they can block the sunlight and the wind – both dry eye causes.  Because our bodies require water for all major functions, it’s no surprise that drinking enough water is a dry eye treatment. In particular, on hotter days, make sure you’re getting adequate hydration, and if you find water boring, add in fruits and vegetables.  Because of their water content, placing cucumbers on the eyes can keep them moist and lubricated – an effective dry eyes home remedy indeed.

As you are speaking of “blood accumulated in the brain” I understand that you mean hemorrhagic stroke (also know as intracerebral hemorrage). There are different causes for ICH (see table below for an exhaustive list), among which   (=balloon-like bulge in the wall of a blood vessel),   (which leads to chronic modification of the structure blood vessels, which becomes weaken) and   (= deposition of amyloid which renders the vessel weak and increases its risk of rupture. This occurs often in the elderly) Depending on the location of the ruptured vessel, the brain region and hence the associated clinical symptoms vary. It doesn’t stay for ever in the brain. Like in any other regions of the body, the hematoma becomes necrotic over time (=blood cells die). The presence of these cells in the parenchyma leads to an inflammation (+ presence of oedema). In particular, specialised cells (called macrophages) arrive into the zone and start “eating” the dead blood and dead neuronal cells. Below is a table which summarises the change occurring after an ICH: Finally regarding your question on the  . Well, this depends on several factors. ICH generally show poorer outcomes than ischemic stroke but as I don’t know your uncle’s case it is not possible to give you a prognosis (and probably nobody can, as it depends on so many variables).  However, what has been proven in the literature, is that recovery after a stroke is dependent on the capacity of the brain to “reorganise” and to “adapt” to the neuronal loss. I don’t know in which country you are, but in general, patients with ICH are generally quickly hospitalised in a so called "stroke unit “ (if no neurosurgical intervention is needed) where intensive physiotherapy is done in order to quickly “train” the brain to develop new neuronal pathways. Drugs have no impact on accumulated blood. Their main aim is to try to reduce "further damages", for example by reducing the hypertension. So according to the report attached, your uncle suffers from an ischemic stroke ("subacute infarction in the middle left cerebral artery"). This shifts the diagnosis from an hemorrhagic stroke (as you suggested with your description of "blood accumulated in the brain") to an ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is caused by a "clot" which occludes the vessel. The middle cerebral artery is a common source of ischemic stroke. The most frequent cause is atrial fibrillation (=abnormal rythm of the heart, which makes the heart pump "inefficiently" leading to accumulated blood clots to be ejected to the brain). As from the report, it looks like your uncle had a subacute stroke (= some hours ago), probably your uncle was outside the so called "lysis" time, which is the time were lysis (= destruction of the clot which occludes the vessel) can be undertaken. The therapy is similar to what I have described regarding ICH (particularly regarding physiotherapy). Though, one major difference is that probably a cause for the ischemic stroke will be investigated. Probably he will have a heart rythm investigation and a carotid doppler (= look at the carotid in the neck to see whether there are some stenosis (narrowing of vessel) or plaques). They might also start some drugs which depend on your uncle's situation (anticoagulation, statins,etc...) Hope this brought some clarification! Sources:

Different countries have different guildelines and therefore different indexes, eg. in USA there is   and in Netherlands there is  . I do not know what is being used in Italy. Now, all there diets may have their strengths and weaknesses but their overall index-score can be high which could lead to labelling such diet as "healthy" despite some deficencies.

Healthy Eating Index is used as a measure and scores are: vegetarian 57,7 points; vegan 90,2 points; traditional 24,9 points. Vegan diet seems to be clearly superior in comparision with traditional one.  Now, I do not say that I agree with this method and its results, but I think that this is possible reason for someone to call vegan diet as "proven healthy".

(Minor nit: see note 1.) The difference is in your own compliance. Will you actually do the exercise plan you've set out for yourself? Will you actually be able to eat no more than the calories you've planned out? Some people are hungrier when they exercise more; others for whatever reason are not.  If your calorie reduction is coming from replacing sugared soda with water, and you're happy enough to drink water, you will probably not resist doing it. If your calorie reduction is coming from no longer having bedtime icecream, or no longer having a beer or two every night, it may be much harder to comply with. If your exercise increase is coming from joining some team or group activity that is fun, you may enjoy it a lot and look forward to doing it, and cheerfully have some sort of "treat" afterwards because you're burning so many more calories each day. Without knowing the details of the two plans, and your own temperament, nobody can know which you would find easier to follow. But that is the one that will be better  -- for you!! -- for effective weight loss. [1] Once you start to build muscle from the exercise, your natural burn rate will go up a bit, as will your not-exercising-just-living activity level, making option 2 slightly better, all things being equal.

8835	8837	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/8837	Arachnoid cysts (AC) are a collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the arachnoid membrane. The CSF is produced by the arachnoid cells which line the cyst. The exact mechanism by which those cyst appear and grow is still not clear. The current main theories are passive diffusion of CSF into the cyst or progressive entrapment due to a ball valve effect. The image below (from  ) shows you an arachnoid cyst (the structure in red). Arachnoid cysts represent 1% of intracranial masses. In a retrospective study conducted among adult brain MRI, the prevalence of arachnoid cyst was 1.4 percent; of these, only 5 percent were symptomatic. Symptomatic arachnoid cysts are more frequent in children (75 percent of symptomatic arachnoid cysts occur in children) Most of those cysts (approximatively 50%) arise in the Sylvian fissure (so approximatively in the same region as your sister’s AC), although they may occur in any part of the nervous system where there is arachnoid. Other common sites include: cerebral convexity, interhemispheric fissure, suprasellar cistern, quadrigeminal cistern, cerebellopontine angle, midline of the posterior fossa, and the spine.  Cysts in the Sylvian fissure are usually asymptomatic but can present with headache, seizure and less commonly, focal neurological deficits. Subdural hematomas may occur following relatively minor head trauma. Treatment is generally initiated if patients have symptoms. If mainly asymptomatic, current recommendations recommend serial imaging and neurologic examinations (as suggested by your neurologist). 
In general, surgery is indicated if patients suffer from symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, seizures, focal neurologic deficits (= motor or sensory problems in face, limbs) or cognitive impairment.

The main thing is that the mask should not allow the allergens to reach your respiratory tract (also the eyes should be protected if you have eye problems because of the allergy).

Also, common medical masks won't help you a lot.

There's some reusable ones available that you can wash and they look more like bandanas than masks.
   Medical masks can be absorbent to prevent water droplets that may contain bacteria from getting past the mask. I can imagine how this could be bad for allergies as it might absorb and hold allergens in the mask. As far as only wearing it outside I think that would be more appropriate than wearing it all the time. Most indoor locations are air conditioned/heated which means air passes through some kind of filter at least.

All they are saying is that they strongly recommend no more than 10% of total daily calorie intake be in the form of sugars, and they conditionally recommend that no more than 5% be the goal. So, if your daily caloric intake goal is 2000 calories, they recommend no more than 200 calories come from sugars. Adjust for your own caloric needs. (Just as a note, many food labels in the United States assume a 2000 calorie diet for their serving size/dietary information panels. Most will tell you the calorie amount they are basing it on.) Technically, yes, if you eat 10,000 calories in a day, you could have 1,000 calories of sugar.

Yes, there is carbohydrate sugar in fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, legumes, dairy, basically everything, but a carrot/apple/slice of bread/etc has more in it than just its energy content.   (eg, 'eat 5 serves of vegetables/day, 2 serves of fruit/day, etc.) are constructed based on currently understood empirical evidence such that 95% of the healthy population could consume it and experience the least amount of food-related chronic disease risk - which more or less translates to 'bare minimum to get the body's micro-nutrient needs without excessive calorie intake (and thus the associated weight gain and associated problems). I'm assuming most countries use a similar mindset. You can read the health educator guide or summary of scientific evidence publication   for a more detailed explanation of of why the decisions were made and based on what evidence (or look up your own country's guidelines or international bodies like the WHO).  If you're 'using up' your daily calorie limit on foods that are primarily energy (calories) with no associated micro-nutrients (eg. processed snack foods/drinks with loads of excess "free sugars"), you're missing an opportunity to meet your body's micro-nutrient needs without exceeding your daily calorie needs. That doesn't necessarily mean that you can't ever have junk food - Australia's dietary guidelines were formed with actual eating behaviors in mind (not just biochemical ideals), so the daily recommendations do allow for occasional discretionary (junk food) choices, because you need to be realistic about what the majority of the population is able to achieve. 	2017-05-03 17:25:29Z	John Tanks	3

There are a variety of dietary supplements that claim to aid in circulation; however, I can't prove that they will - or won't - work.  So, my best advice would be to obviously, get up and move when you can. Since that isn't always possible, I will give you some ideas for stretches you can do that won't take up too much space.  You can tap your feet and circle your ankles. Try not to cross your legs; however, most of us do - especially if we're on a long trip -, so at least try to frequently change your leg position. If you are sitting in a seat that causes your feet not to touch the floor/ground, try to keep your legs swinging and again, change positions as often as possible. Try to keep your legs from falling asleep, that would certainly be a sign that you've been in one position for too long.

It is often used for open blisters on feet during a walking event when the walker want to continue walking (before taping the foot). See  . The full treatment is (according to the dutch red cross):
 - Wash hands
 - Wear gloves
 - Clean wound area
 - Use a disenfectance, beware of allergies
 - Apply the second skin (must overlap at least 1cm on healthy skin.
 - Remove gloves (some people can tape with gloves, most can't)
 - Tape the area.
 - Apply some talcum powder so the tape won't stick to socks.
 - Wash hands again. Taping is a skill that takes practice. It must be smooth and has a 33/50% overlap. A good method is to measure a piece of tape, first attach the center and gently strike the tape outwards.  If you don't have second skin (or you don't want to use it) you can use normal wound dressing but you have some risk that this sticks to the wound. So I won't reccomend it.	2016-11-04 14:55:12Z	Toon Krijthe	1

You can't influence where your body loses fat, only if and how much. See   to this. 
The kernel of truth is that if you improve your posture by strenghtening your core muscle, you may appear to have less belly fat. The appearance of a fat belly is often partially due to a hollow back. I don't know you and your back so I don't know if this applies to you. 
You won't do an effective exercise without dedicating time and concentration to it. Fortunately 10-20 min every few days can help a lot. But when you train, you need to train, you need to concentrate on the exercises and your body. Form the habit, stick with it for a while, then it will become normal and easy to dedicate some time to your body. 
The kernel of truth: When you develop a proper feel for your body and where your spine should be in a neutral position through exercise, you can should self check your posture often to make sure you don't slouch in an unhealthy way. This is helpful and healthy, just not exercise. I suggest to think more about what your goals are (why do you want to loose belly fat) and then come back here or to fitness.SE for targeted training advice.	2016-08-11 11:53:20Z	Community	1

During exercise, the glucose uptake by muscles is increased so glucose level in the blood drops down. Thus, less (or no) insulin is needed during exercise. For more details, I found useful information in a biology lecture in Columbia University, New York:  I can summarize it like this:
Insulin works on cell surface receptors.
In resting skeletal muscle & adipose tissues insulin acts through the receptor GLUT4 which promotes the infusion of glucose to the cell cytoplasm. In liver and brain: They can take up glucose without insulin -- they do not use GLUT4. They use different transporters (GLUT 1, 2 &/or 3) located permanently in the plasma membrane. Insulin has no effect on glucose uptake in brain. In Working skeletal muscle:  Insulin is not required for the uptake of glucose because exercise mobilizes GLUT4 in skeletal muscle.

Fat can't dissolve in water in its most part, that's why the body uses bile salts generated by the liver. Bile salts are amphipatic, meaning that they have an "oily" part and a "watery" part, and allow the formation of emulsions to mix fat and water in a way that allows the digestive system to break them down. However, the liver can't do this with any amount of fat you want, it will eventually get saturated causing some of the fat to be eliminated with stools often accompanied with awful smell, pain, cramps and funny noises (check steatorrhea). I can't tell you exactly what is the limit for a normal human being but for sure it's way lower than the recommended daily calorie intake. The body just can't take it.	2016-08-04 13:16:08Z	Variax	0

In small children this amount is obviously lower, and in infants as little as 1 cup (237 mL) of water can cause intoxication.  Two things to consider: Here is a more detailed explanation with several reports of
 The kidney water excretion capacity mentioned in the question is about right (800-1,000 mL of water/hour), but you need to understand this correctly.  If you, as an adult, drink, for example, 3 liters of water in one hour (not in successive hours), this should not really be a problem. First, you have probably drunk that because you were thirsty, so dehydrated, which means you have just replaced the water you have been missing.  Even if you drink 3 liters of water in one hour when you are already well hydrated, this should not be a big problem. Water needs some time to be absorbed and the circulatory system has some capacity to expand. Your blood sodium levels will fall a bit (within normal range) without any damage and your kidneys will eventually excrete the excess of water in 3 hours or so. But, 3 liters in one hour and 3 liters next hour...it can be a big problem. In conclusion, it's not likely you will get intoxicated with water by accident. For that, you usually need to consciously exaggerate with drinking for several hours in a row while ingesting no or only little sodium.  	2016-08-02 19:19:34Z	Jan	5
7645	7649	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7649	Your understanding of the effect of BCAA's on serotonin is not 100% correct. Let me preface this with "I am not a biochemist", I'm learning like everyone and if anyone who has a degree could improve my answer, please do! Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) refers to three amino acids: Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine. Leucine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis, while isoleucine induces glucose uptake into cells. The central hypothesis of fatigue (which assumes that elevated serotonin concentrations in the brain are associated with induction of fatigue  [2]) is thought to be related to the anti-fatigue effects of BCAA supplementation.[3]  During exercise, the plasma ratio of aromatic amino acids (tryptophan) to long chain neutral amino acids (the BCAAs and a few others) is altered in favour tryptophan [2][4][5] due to BCAAs undergoing oxidation and being destroyed [11], and due to tryptophan and BCAAs sharing the same transport into the brain [6][7][8] and this act of transportation is the rate limiting step [3] any alteration in the ratio will alter what amino acids transport into the brain, and exercise has been confirmed to increase tryptophan uptake in as little as 30 minutes[9][10] and increasing tryptophan availability via supplementation (without supplemental BCAAs) appears to promote fatigue in rats.[11] Increased tryptophan transport into the brain (which produces serotonin via 5-HTP) is a possible causative factor of fatigue, and replenishing oxidized BCAAs to preserve the ratio can attenuate fatigue production.[3] .  Imagine the bus lane on a road going into town. Buses and taxis can use this lane but they cannot occupy the same space at the same time (without crashing).  At the start the ratio is fairly even. Rush hour hits and lots of taxis are required, leading to the buses being inhibited from entering town. Once the taxis run dry the ratio swings back the other way with buses filling the bus lane. The result is after rush hour there are more buses in the lane meaning that you are tired (but happy!) BCAA Taxis   (get it?) their fleet by hiring more cabs. Rush hour hits again but instead of taxis running out really fast and buses clogging up the bus lane the ratio of buses to taxis remains constant through the period. The result is that after rush hour there is no imbalance in the ratio between Tryptophan and BCAA transport. You shouldn't, accumulated knowledge suggests that: My personal recommendation is,  .

Below a table with a list of the possible aetiologies for ADEM (from Garg et al). Current evidence suggest that ADEM results from a transient autoimmune reaction against myelin or other autoantigens which occur through a phenomenon of molecular mimicry or activation of autoreactive T cells. Your question You can find additional information in the complete report for each of the study. Probably yes, or at least that full remyelination has not completely finished. Concerning your question about the potential of remyelination: There isn't much information available on ADEM and remyelination, but at it shares some common features in terms of pathogenesis with multiple sclerosis (MS), let's take some evidence concerning remyelination in MS: We know that the treatment of MS aims at two things (1,2): While the first has showed some interesting results thanks to growing number of immunomodulatory therapies on the market (among which glucocorticoids, which are also used in ADEM treatment), the second has still to be proven.  Although some immunomodulatory therapies might indirectly stimulate remyelination, current therapies directly targeting regeneration of myelin sheats have yet to be proven. Furthermore, the presence of axon degeneration despite immunomodulatory therapies, suggest that axon integrity and protection may occur through mechanisms independent of inflammation (3,4). Huang et al provide a good summary of   (5): The article by Huang et al also provides a good review (it is open access) on the current pharmacological targets for remyelination as well as the barriers of remyelination (among which age, probably explaining while cases of ADEM in the adults show a worse outcome that cases in children).

Thus, someone who weights 80kg (176lb) could thus safely ingest 0.024mg of mercury a day. Given that tuna is about .2ppm (parts per million) mercury, that equates to 120g tuna per day. Note that this is not the maximum safe amount but merely the highest they tested, so the maximum safe level is not known. In terms of grams per bodyweight, it changes per person. A 150lb person can safely consume 3.75oz of tuna per day, whereas a 210lb person can consume over 5oz per day. TL;DR You can safely eat 1.5g/kg (0.7g per lb) of bodyweight in canned tuna per day.

That said, when you are at the doctor's office and they take your HR you'll likely read a bit higher, much like you would sitting at your desk. Traditional ideal RHR ranges i.e. ones that tend higher assume the reading at your desk/doctor's office. The "new standard" takes into account people who use their Fitbit/smartphone app/whatnot wizmo gadget first thing in the morning before hopping out of bed and thus suggests a lower ideal. I would not consider an RHR in the low to mid 40's a condition in highly trained individuals; even following entry level endurance training regiments non-smoking, healthy-eating types can easily dip into the low 50's, in my experience. A RHR at or close to 100 definitely approaches risky territory for the average person but other risk factors (smoking, obesity, etc.) would likely present before RHR approaches those levels. When present in combination with these activities, therefore, such a high RHR would be considered "normal" but your doctor would tell you to quit smoking, eat healthier, and get more exercise rather than to bring your RHR down.	2016-08-02 13:03:22Z		5
8698	9342	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9342	You must consider here why you want to measure your resting heart rate. While one may argue whether you should measure it in the morning while you are still in bed or after you have eaten breakfast, but what matters in practice is what will give the best results when monitoring your fitness, particularly to monitor for possible overtraining. So, what you want to do is measure your heart rate when you are rest under conditions that give the most consistent results. For some people this is when they are lying down in bed just after they've woken. But some people need to get up first, go to the toilet before they get consistent results.  E.g. I tend to have a slightly elevated heart rate in the morning and it fluctuates more compared to when I measure it just before exercise time. In my case this is caused by my 4000 Kcal diet, in the morning there is still 2000 Kcal worth of digested food that needs to come out, the pressure in the intestines can slightly influence the heart rate. My resting heart rate is typically a bit below 40 bpm, but after 3 days of fast one hour running sessions it can be a bit elevated. Should it be systematically elevated even after a pause of a few days, e.g. if I were to measure 45 bpm, then I need to consider if I've been exercising too hard, or if something else is wrong. I can then pay closer attention to heart rate during exercise and how the exercise session feels like do some more measurements of heart rate during exercise and how fast it goes down afterward.  The fact that my general fitness is good makes such measurement reliable, because my heart rate relaxes to its resting value very fast. If I run up some stairs very fast and sit down then the heart rate goes down to the resting value within about 20 seconds. It will in fact undershoot it and then climb upwards (it can e.g. go down to 34 bpm and then climb to 38 bpm). Other heart rate measurements that are useful to do are measurements during exercise and after exercise to monitor how fast you are recuperating. Also measurements immediately after fixed short duration exertions will give useful information if the resting heart rate is elevated due to some problem. E.g. I know that my heart rate immediately after doing 40 push-ups is typically around 85 bpm. Should I have a lot of stress then the resting heart rate could be elevated to perhaps 44 bpm instead if 38 bpm, but the heart rate after doing the 40 push-ups should then still be about 85 bpm. If however, this has also increased a lot, say to 100 bpm, then I would assume that there is a problem like e.g. overtraining.	2016-09-23 02:22:02Z	Count Iblis	1

7621	9814	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9814	Mental fatigue: Those who routinely obtain less than 7-9 hours of interrupted sleep per 24-hour period will have a high homeostatic drive for sleep as the body struggles to restore balance. In addition, scheduling inconsistencies often lead to a high circadian drive for sleep at exactly the wrong times of day as well as to sleep-initiation problems at night. So, when athletes lose sleep due to any number of factors, when they’re unable to stick to a consistent bedtime due to travel or social engagements, and when they have to train or play at the “wrong” times in a new time zone, they’ll be faced with both a high homeostatic and a high circadian drive for sleep. The result will be impaired judgment, reaction time, and situational awareness—the hallmarks of poor mental effectiveness. Physical fatigue: Physical effectiveness, or energy, is different. It’s a function of non-sleep and circadian-related factors such as the type, intensity and volume of exercise (or physical labor) as well as muscle fiber composition, neuromuscular characteristics, high energy metabolite stores, buffering capacity, ionic regulation, capillarization, and mitochondrial density. Physical energy can be viewed as the capacity to perform a certain amount and intensity of physical activity for a given period of time. Elite athletes, who routinely engage in high-intensity training, are far less susceptible to physical fatigue than those who are sedentary. They run faster, lift more weight, and perform for longer periods of time due to their enhanced physical conditioning.	2016-10-28 18:06:54Z	Prince	2

Assuming the 1.4% number from the Lancet represents the US patient population, and assuming your 50-million figure is correct, then yes, it means 700K in-patient surgery patients in the US don't leave the hospital every year. But if the Lancet figure is for some other population (the UK or EU, for example) then it doesn't apply. It would probably still be a close estimate, but the numbers all need to come from the same population for them to be reliable.	2016-07-31 16:29:16Z	Carey Gregory	1

I'd suggest that residual is being used here in a similar way. When you classify causes of death, some are easy to put into groups which can also be then sub-categorized (e.g., accidents / transport). In a large population, there will be many deaths that can't be classified in such as easy way and/or a set of causes of death that are relatively rare. In the latter case, if the CDC were to list all of those rare causes of death, then the overall list would be really really long. So I think they are lumping together all the cases of death that are either of unknown cause (think of older people who die of "natural causes" who do not receive autopsies) or of known but very rare cause.	2016-07-30 19:44:45Z	kmm	3

To round off the picture, this is the advocatus diaboli: While the existence of a diagnosis in general demands its application onto some individuals, some of those might indeed benefit from receiving such a diagnosis. That means that the criteria for diagnosis are far from perfected and since it was already correctly noted, these imprecisions are on a spectrum with increasing difficulties to establish valid diagnostic criteria at the extreme ends of this spectrum. It is further complicated by the research focus being mainly on childhood problems and treatment. Adult Asperger's is far less researched and conclusions might be clouded by simply transposing findings from childhood Asperger's onto Adults. So, are there really "benefits" from being diagnosed AS as an adult? There sure are some! But benefits often come with a cost. These have to be considered in an informed decision making process. That seems to indicate a certain 'trend' seen in clinical settings: with increasing awareness of the existence of this 'syndrome' or 'situation' or 'condition'. This is not to say it is a fad or fashionable label to attach to someone or her behaviour. But some psychological or psychiatric diagnosis approaches clearly fell out of fashion some time ago.

For some, it may increase self-awareness to some degree for the sake of possibly capitalizing on one's strengths and managing areas of challenge. For others who qualify, an individual may seek a diagnosis to obtain additional means of support. In order to qualify for disability benefits under most US government financial assistance programs, a formal diagnosis is also required. The   insurance program pays benefits to disabled individuals and certain family members if the individual has worked long enough and has paid Social Security taxes. The   program pays benefits to disabled adults and children who have limited income and resources. For more information about the Social Security disability evaluation process, see: ‘ ' and ’ '. Additionally, under the  , a diagnosis is necessary in order to request reasonable accommodations for individuals seeking employment. A publication by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission titled, ‘ ,’ elaborates: The same publication also states a relevant piece of information to take note of regarding the provision of reasonable employment accommodations for disabled individuals.

Eating 3 times a day will clearly give you the "Jojo-Effect" which causes getting much fat back in a short period of time, after eating a lot of "unhealthy" or much foot. So the method with eating frequently will last longer because you won't get cravings (or not that much) and there is no Jojo-Effect. The metabolism doesn't stop when you're eating something (many people say this), it's always "on". But don't worry about metabolism that much, that makes things more complicated.   eat less calories than you need (~you need 2000 calories, with 30-60min work out up to 3000 a day). But just don't take it too seriously, and have fun loosing weight. I recommend just to eat the right things, and don't always (or never) be hungry.

So: Bodyweight or weight-training, it depents on you. Because YOU have to decide what's the best for your body - if you are too heavy, than do weight-training, of you are fit enough, than do bodyweight training.  Find a partner and work out with him (or go FOR A WALK). You won't believ how much motivation a partner can give you!

Tooth sensitivity can be stopped by   depending on circumstance. Flouride can be used to help build the enamel of the tooth back, root canals can be used to eliminate problems in your root canal and are one of the most successful treatments for this. Also, there are grafts which cover the exposed root canal desensitizing root canal by applying resins. Using desensitizing toothpastes also help and preventing further wear of enamel is always on the treatment plan. The reason why sensitive teeth can get better is because the root canal is exposed and recovering enamel or desensitizing the nerve fixes the problem or makes it less sensitive to pain.
While in this answer I may have used different terminology the word pulp, root canal and root are referring to the nerve in your teeth.	2016-07-27 03:13:32Z	Pobrecita	3

( ) Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta, and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) uses an electric pump. These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether cervical dilation is necessary. From the 15th week of gestation until approximately the 26th, other techniques must be used. Dilation and evacuation (D&E) consists of opening the cervix of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can also be induced by intact dilation and extraction (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called "partial-birth abortion", which has been federally banned in the United States. ( )  ( ) In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or where preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary ( ). This is sometimes called "induced miscarriage". This procedure may be performed from  .

An erection is a complex process. It involves the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, psychological and psychological factors, local factors with the erection bodies or the penis itself, as well as hormonal and vascular components. When stimuli relating to sex are generated from different sources like touch, smell, visual,etc,they travel from the brain to the nerve centers at the base of the spine, where primary nerve fibers connect to the penis and regulate blood flow during erections and afterward.  Sexual stimulation causes the release of chemicals from the nerve endings in the penis that trigger a series of events that ultimately cause muscle relaxation in the erection bodies of the penis. The smooth muscle in the erection bodies controls the flow of blood into the penis. When the smooth muscle relaxes, the blood flow dramatically increases, and the erection bodies become full and rigid, resulting in an erection. Venous drainage channels are compressed and close off as the erection bodies enlarge. So disruption in the any steps of the mechanism is responsible for erection dysfunction.
The causes of erection dysfunction can be broadly classified as: 1.Psychological (mental) factors 
2.Physical factors References	2016-07-22 09:09:00Z	Narusan-in-coma	3

* If you think that eating vegetables, fruits, meat, brown rice, tuna, cinnamon and etc. can kill you or might harm you, you have to change that; the moment you change the way you judge foods that are the time your body will accept those foods that you don't like. If ever you are eating and suddenly you stop because you don't like it, just imagine and think what nutrients and good health benefits it can bring to you before you stop. It's a matter of sacrificing what you really think about this food and reverse it. 
* don't try to eat alone, eating with a team can help you improve your eating disorder because most of the time you are talking, laughing and you don't really mind on the foods that you eat. 
* Having friends that are good in cooking and experimenting different kinds of dishes can help you change the way you treat those foods. Aside from learning new recipes, you can improve your eating disorder because most of the time your friends talk about foods and you will like it in the long run. 
* You can start walking 30 minutes a day be exposed to the sun could help you with your problem.

This is because cancer is caused by mutations in DNA which accumulate over time. 
Since life expectancy in general is higher in developed countries, there is more time for mutations to accumulate and for cancer to develop in these people. 
Less developed countries have lower life expectancy, which means diseases and issues which developed countries have solved or are able to successfully deal with kill large enough portions of populations in undeveloped countries before mutations in DNA can accumulate in these people.

It might be that some kinds of food make you feel worse, for example spiced foods, foods with lots of fats, processed red meat, foods too rich in fiber like legums or vegetables and diary products are more likely to irritate your bowel. Similarly, drinking fizzy drinks, alcohol, coffee or tea can also cause irritation.

(where milk is essential for the nourishment of newborn). After this period (in general after the weaning period)  . As such, two groups of individuals emerge:  Some studies have suggested a geographic pattern for the distribution of genes associated with the two conditions (the review by   provides a good overview).

There are other  : small bowel bacterial overgrowth, giardiasis (a type of infectious enteritis), coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease. In these cases, gastrointestinal disorders damage the brush border of the small intestine and leads to a decrease in lactase activity. Your question There are several possible explanations. First, some studies have shown an increased incidence of lactose intolerance in the elderly, suggesting that lactase activity might decline further with age. In particular, individuals with already intermediate to low lactase activity might be at higher risk of developing lactase intolerance decades after the infancy period. Second a secondary cause for lactase deficiency cannot be excluded. Finally, a study conducted in 1998 showed that there is sometimes a confusion between lactose maldigestion and lactose intolerance.  , as you don't provide enough information in your question (in particular how the diagnosis of lactose intolerance was made) Your question I have found no studies conducted in humans showing that lactase activity could be regained. Current treatment of lactose intolerance aims at improving symptoms while maintaining sufficient calcium intake, which can be affected by mil restricted diet. According to a concensus of experts, initial management of lactose intolerance is to aim for remission of symptoms by avoiding milk and dairy products. Here an interesting extract of the recommendations: If the above mentioned measures don’t provide any relief, pharmacological strategies can be considered such as lactase supplements, lactose-hydrolyzed or lactose-reduced milk, probiotics, colonic adaptation, and rifaximin.

Varying frequencies can be applied, from low (< 10 Hz) to high (> 50 Hz). Depending the intensity used, the patients feels from a strong but comfortable sensation to motor contraction (sensory intensity of TENS vs motor intensity of TENS). The most frequent use of TENS is in pain control, but other approaches have been described in the literature (cognitive improvement, blood pressure control, etc...). The   is complex and depends on the localisation of the TENS stimulation. For example, it has been shown that in pain control, TENS activates so called “small diameter fiber”s that lead to an inhibition of pain facilitatory pathways from the central nervous system. 
  such as serotonin, acetylcholine. Additionally, TENS also activate opioid receptors, explaining its role in pain control and noradrenaline receptors, suggesting its role in blood pressure control. Your question  Your question doesn’t provide information on how you applied TENS. Experience from pain control studies have shown that activation of large diameter fibres by high frequency TENS leads to more profound and longer lasting inhibition of central pain transmission. Also, the effect of TENS may decline with time due to a phenomen of habituation. These evidences suggest that TENS modulates (either in short term or long term) the function and activity of fiber receptors. 
I couldn’t find an example in the literature concerning your specific use of TENS, but it is possible that repeated TENS might have altered neurotransmission of some fibers. The glans penis is innvervated by the dorsal nerve of the penis. Depending on your location of the TENS, it may be possible that some of these fibers have been “overstimulated” by TENS, leading to the symptoms you are describing. Your statement I found a study (See in "Sources) that showed that TENS induces a vasodilatator effect on its stimulation site. Interestingly, a trial has been launched in 2016 with the aim to investigate the effect of TENS on arterial stiffness and blood pressure in indivduals with hypertension. So the currently rather sparse evidence regarding TENS and vasodilatator effect has to be confirmed. Your statement As you have already suggested, sexual side effects is often reported in patients under antihypertensive drugs. Interestingly, in one study investigating the effect of five antihypertensive drugs (acebutolol, amlodipine maleate, chlorthalidone, doxazosin maleate, or enalapril maleate) on sexual function, doxazosine was associated with the lowest incidence of sexual dysfunction.  Overall, it is difficult to categorise the symptoms you are describing. From the above points, a mixed aetiology (both the use of TENS and the side effects of doxazine) cannot be excluded. One approach would be to discuss it with your family doctor. If you take doxazosine as an antihypertensive drug, maybe a switch of antihypertensive drug can help unveiling the role of doxazosine in the symptoms you have described.

Usually the former type of error should not be in play, the tests will have been designed such that on average the tests results are correct. The latter type of error is always in play, this leads to an error margin that typically gets worse at lower measured values. This means that there will always exist a lowest cutoff value such that measurement values below it will be consistent with a real value ranging from zero up to the cutoff. This will then be reported like your value for the microsomal antibodies. For values that are a bit higher than the cutoff, the protocol will be to report the measured value, but the measurement error may still be significant. 	2016-07-09 18:31:27Z	Count Iblis	3

That is because our body cannot break down cellulose (a polysaccharide that makes up the cell wall of plants and is the main energy source for herbivores).  Cellulose, like starch, is a carbohydrate made up of glucose monomers. You cannot digest cellulose but you can digest starch which is one of the main sources of energy for humans.  Coming back to your question: No. It is not really implementable. Some leaves (like spinach) are rich in certain nutrients but you need a primary energy source. Though fats also provide energy, carbohydrates cannot be replaced because the intermediates of   i.e. breakdown of glucose (which in turn comes from carbohydrates like starch), are essential for many other vital processes in the body (such as DNA synthesis). There is a biochemical pathway known as   which can produce these intermediates from amino acids and certain fats (fatty acids with odd number of carbon atoms in the side chain). Leaves won't provide these as well, in sufficient amounts.  Finally you need proteins which is again poor in leaves. Herbivores consume a lot of food to meet their metabolic needs. Have a look at   in Biology.SE. Our digestive system is not really tuned for this kind of a job. This is a broad question and is also subjective.

The positive effects seem to be linked to better mood and concentration, and preventing a number of cancers and Type II diabetes.

It raises blood pressure levels make it harder for people with Type II diabetes to manage their insulin levels. Coffee is also a mutagenic. So whatever health positives there are, there seems to be a risk for the opposite to occur, which is a bit paradoxical.

There are also some other effects (good and bad) you can read about. There is also the finding in rat subjects that  . The health benefits your friends are referring to, I think are dubious. If you don't even enjoy coffee, I think the net effect may even be negative for you. There is usually a peer pressure around drinking coffee (because it is a stimulant drug), and maybe they just want you to join in. I am a coffee drinker, and the main reason I drink it is because it gets me alert in the morning (and I have learned to enjoy the taste, which is a positive). I also use it as a short-term mood booster to get back to work, if my morale starts to wind down. But on the negative side is that it can make you jittery and anxious, and the motivation gained is followed by a "crash" where your concentration and mood will slip.  Coffee does not provide concentration over an extended time, so any cognitive performance increase will be short-lived. Basically, caffeine will only help you work longer  , but it will   improve cognitive performance if you are already energized. Think of it as a 2 am quick fix, not an 11 am booster. It will however probably improve physical performance a bit whenever. From your description of yourself, I would   start. You do not seem to need it, in any practical way. Regarding tea, it usually contains some caffeine (there are caffeine-free teas), but it may also provide more antioxidants. It may be a better health choice than coffee.	2016-07-09 07:42:19Z	Winterflags	1

Infact hot and cold therapy is suggested to patients with arthritis. When you run you cause wear and tear in your muscles and also sweat causing your body temperature to rise. Cold water brings your heated muscles back to homeostasis faster than your body will. Arthritis is caused by inflammation of joints which is caused by excessive wear and tear and unless you allow your body(immune system) to heal those microtrauma in your leg muscles caused by running you might eventually cause inflammation which is what arthritis is. A healthy immune system is protective. It generates internal inflammation to get rid of infection and prevent disease.

The exact definition of metastases is more and more debated in the last decades (for an excellent review see the review by  ), mainly because the advances in cancer research have permitted to unveil new characteristics (genetical, biochemical, surface membrane expression,...) of metastasic cells.  According to Welch,  Metastatic process is dependent on  :  Once these malignant cells are in the circulation, they have to repeat the above mentioned steps at a remote site. Additionally, in order to survive in a foreign tissue, they need to find a "hospitable niche", where they must avoid detection by host defences and warrant blood supply by inducing the growth of new blood vessels.  As you see, the metastatic process is complex and depends on several factors. The rate-limiting step in the metastatic process is the ability for tumor cells to survive and expand in a novel microenvironment. Not all cells have this faculty (so called “metastatic phenotype”) and current evidence suggest that probably only small fraction of tumor cells have this capacity.  Studies have shown that chemokine receptors play a role in the metastatic capacity of a malignant cell. Also, recently, some candidate metastasis-suppressor genes, whose loss of function was associated with metastasis have been identified. Further studies are ongoing in order to understand the genetic and molecular pathways underlying the metastatic process. So as suggested in one of the comment, the metastic process (and therefore spreading areas) in lung cancer (but also in other type of cancer) is dependent on the malignant cells and on their genotype/phenotype.	2016-07-11 14:34:20Z	M.

Beneath hairloss other symptoms are listlesness, dry skin, feeling cold or  gaining weight easily.
The TSH should be between 0.4 and 4 ( ).
The best would be to visit an internist/endocrinologist and start a L-thyroxine substitution. 
If the wrinkles are because of the hypothyroidism, the substitution should solve the problem.  Click   for an image of the thyroid hormone controll loop. The hypothalamus constantly screens the bloodlevels of thyroid hormones. If they are too low, it releases TRH (thyreotropin releasing hormone). TRH stimulates the pituary gland to produce TSH (Thyrotropin or thyroidea stimulating hormone). An increase in TRH leads to an increase of TSH. TSH than stimulates the thyroid gland to produce T4 which finally becomes T3, the active thyroid hormone, in the tissue (the most conversion from T4 to T3 happens in the brain). If there is a lack of thyroid hormone, the hypothalmus senses it and through increased TRH more TSH ist produced. However if the thyroid gland is insufficient and can't respond to elevated TSH levels with producing T4 there is no negative feedback, thus leading to a further increase of TSH levels. That's why high TSH levels indicate  thyroidism. TSH under 0.4 is therefore an indicator for  thyroidism. Hypothyroidism is usually harmless and is treated with L-Thyroxine (artificial T4) substitution. 	2016-07-02 21:27:19Z	KTB	0

7264	7272	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7272	In medicine, upset stomach, bloating, discomfort or pain in the belly as well as feeling full quickly when eating is often referred as functional dyspepsia (FD). Although functional dyspepsia can be present without overeating, FD can be precipitated by rapid eating and overeating. Several studies have shown that delayed gastric emptying and gastric hypersensitivity to acid or distension are involved in the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia. What is the role of antacids in symptoms of FD or overeating? The exact role of acids in gastric motility has still to be defined. Current evidence suggest that gastric protons lead to the release of mediators (from the upper small intestine), which activate neuronal systems involved in controlling gastric motility. Additionally, high concentrations of acid are associated with increased fundic tone and impaired sensation to distension of the fundus. It is therefore possible that antacids, in particular proton pomp inhibitors (PPI), may reduce postprandial symptoms by modulating the effect of protons (acids) on gastric motility. Interestingly, in 2006, a pilot study conducted among 12 healthy volunteers, showed that the administration of a PPI (20 mg bid for 2 days) reduced postprandial symptoms 30 min after ingestion of a small test meal. Other studies have reported that H2RA (Histamine H2 Antagonist) reduce intragastric volume and therefore lead to a reduction in postprandial fullness. Sources:	2016-07-01 18:24:17Z	M. Arrowsmith	1
7257	7274	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7274	While whole grain bread is said to have some healthy effects (lowering chance of diabetes II compared to white flour bread), it also contains anti-digestive substances from the grains - unless it has lots of sour dough which fermented that. I am not sure whether those anti-digestives already impact the pre-digestion in the stomach, though. Okay, disclaimer, what follows now is solely based on my personal experience (and what some friends told). Perhaps it's over the scope of the specific question - but if you're interested to get rid of reflux no matter whether it comes from bread or something else, here you go: I would say that any "simple" food alone is not very likely to cause acid reflux, unless you eat   of it and then drink some fluid.
It is when some certain different kinds of foods, or even foods in different stages of pre-digestion, meet and mix in the stomach, and potentially also if you add fluid at certain stages of pre-digestion.
Since this is based on experience (confirmed by some people I know, but maybe it's not universal), I can't give exact definitions of those things.
But you might be able to make sense of symptoms and connect some dots if you experiment yourself. The occurrence of reflux, or at least some pre stages of that, like unpleasant feeling and smelling gas coming up the throat, seems to be most likely if you ate a generous meal which contained lots of everything. Lots of protein, lots of fat, lots of carbs of different kinds (starches, sugars).
It may get worse if then fluid is added.
It may get real bad if you generated a mix in your stomach for which, for some reason, the stomach needs a long time before it opens the passage to the small bowel. It sometimes almost feels like some sort of fermentation is going on.
Then if you eat something again, perhaps because you eat in typical intervals, while the stomach still has this "difficult mix", taking longer than "normal", it can get even worse, if fresh food is added to that which is already in there for too long.
Especially if you add fruit or sweets to a very fatty meal of some time ago. I have seen this also when mixing (in the stomach) lots of whole grain bread with cheese and some time later lots of nuts. I do not have such problems anymore (> 10 years) since I moved to eating my peculiar "diet". For one thing it's plant based. But I   most relevant here being that I usually avoid mixing "lots of everything" in my stomach. I might eat a big bowl of salad. Some potatoes with some peas. Or just a mix of veggies, perhaps with a little oil or avocado, not a ton of dressing or gravy with sugar + fat. Or some non-salted non-roasted nuts without anything. Or some fruit.
But when I feel there still is some remainder of something in the stomach, I do not eat anything, period. In the morning, when many people say you should stuff your belly when it feels weird, I do not eat - the weird feeling (that I rarely have anymore) goes away by itself when I'm fully awake some hours later. Then I eat. Something feels strange in the belly? I do not eat. Oh, and when you  , which contained lots of fluid or you added some to your stomach content after eating, and then only 1 hour or less later, you go to bed - if you have a tendency to rotate such that your   - that may cause reflux!

Performing those exercises on a ball challenges the neck and upper thoracic spine and is therefore not appropriate for people with significant acute pain along those areas. A patient should at least be able to hold their neck in a neutral position to avoid excessive stress while performing arm abduction on a ball.  The ball also adds an element of instability to the entire body, whereas the exercises on the bed and floor do not really challenge your balance or core strength relative to the ball. The ball would not be appropriate for people who have problems with their ankles/feet as they would be required to stabilize themselves through the entire lower kinetic chain before they can do it safely.  Basically, the ball is just a progression of the exercises that should initially be done on the floor/bed. Pending the stage of the patient's recovery and overall status, they can then progress to the ball. Resistance can then be added by carrying free weights or using elastic theraband.

[1] One of those is that "health" is not a one-dimensional thing, and nutrients are not always needed. If you have a balanced diet you won't have any shortages and an apple will just be a tasty bite of calories and fibers, keeping you feeling full for a reasonable amount of time, and most of the nutrients it contains will be excreted or metabolized.  If you're short on some vitamins or minerals that are in an apple, eating an apple might be good for you. However, not all fruits are created equal, and "nutrients" is are not a single entity. If you are low on potassium you should eat a banana, if you're low on vitamin C you should eat a bell pepper. Another thing is that obesity is the #1 food-related health risk for almost all people. [2] While an apple is more healthy than the same amount of sugar in a candy bar, fruits contain more calories than vegetables (in general), so for most people it would be better to eat some vegetables than some fruit.

Vitamin-C is not the only thing said to be needed by the immune system, though. Frequently zinc and iron are mentioned. Some berries have lots of iron and vitamin-C.
 Though, the quote you gave is very old (?) and I doubt the "immune system" was a concept when that saying originated. The immune system is not the only part of the body which needs nutrition. Apples are probably one of the most widely known and available types of fruit, hence the choice for that old saying you quoted.
It is common knowledge that they used to have barrels with apples on ships hundreds of years ago, to prevent the crews from getting scurvy. Their nutrient vs. calorie ratio is certainly better, in average, than what the e.g. victorian poor folk apparently ate: bread, butter, potatoes, beer, and tea. (Potatoes contain more of certain minerals, though).
 Btw.:
Apples, and some berries, too, are rather aggressive on the teeth due to their high acid content, though. I wouldn't eat them all day - as a matter of fact, I used to, and it did harm my enamel.

7227	7295	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7295	 represent a group of disorders involving the masticatory muscles, the temporomandibular joint and associated structures. Stress, age and gender are common risk factors for TMD. TMD is often characterised by aural symptoms such as tinnitus, otalgia, vertigo, otic fullness sensation, hyperacousia or hypoacousia. Current understanding of TMD suggest that temporomandibular joint pain is due to pathological contraction of masticatory muscles which stimulate the realease of inflammatory molecules around the temporomandibular joint.  Several hypothesis have been suggested to explain the otological symptoms associated with TMD among which that the position of the joint disk during jaw movement increases pressure in the Eustachian tube, the ear structures and the auriculotemporal and masseteric nerve, which innervate the tympanic membrane, the anterosuperior part of the external ear and the tragus. Additionally, studies have reported that in TMD, the tensor tympani muscle is in a pathological hypertonic state that may lead to hypoacusia, tinnitius, vertigo, otalgia and otic fulness sensation. Finally, some studies showed that TMD peripherally sensitizes the V and VII nerve pairs, leading to tonic spasm of these middle ear muscles and to hearing loss.  While, I could not find a study directly correlating ear pain with hearing loss, a study (see Sources) showed that hearing loss is correlated to TMD severity.

7218	7286	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7286	 As soon, somebody has “memory problems”, a diagnosis of “dementia” comes in mind. However, the definition of dementia is much more complex. Dementia is a clinical syndrome of cognitive decline that is sufficiently severe to interfere with social or occupational functioning. Cognitive decline affects different cognitive function such as memory but also language, executive and visuospatial functions. The most frequent cause of dementia is Alzheimer Disease (AD). Other common causes are vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD).   Dementia is a condition that can affect younger individuals. Dementia related conditions onset before 65 years of age are defined as "Early-Onset Dementia" (EOD) or “Presenile Dementia”. While AD, VaD and DLB are frequent causes of EOD, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Alcohol-associated Dementia (AAD), Huntington’s disease (HD), Parkinson’s disease Dementia (PDD), Mixed Dementia (MD) and Creutzfeldt-jakob disease (CJD) and Down’s syndrome are other frequent causes. Epidemiological findings about the prevalence of EOD are scarce. According to the existing epidemiological studies, the prevalence of EOD ranges from 4.9 to 8 per 100.000 (35-39 years) and 11.9 to 17 per 100.000 (40-44 years) in your specified age group (late 30s, early 40s). While some of the above mentioned diseases can appear “de novo” (without know risk factor), patients suffering from EOD often have a positive family history for dementia related conditions.   As already mentioned, dementia is a clinical syndrome which is largely heterogenous in its clinical presentation, aetiology and underlying pathophysiology. As such, each type of dementia related conditions is defined by specific criteria which are based on clinical examination, neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging studies.  The diagnosis of dementia is associated with important consequences for the patient. As such, in many countries, assessment of dementia is carried out by specialised clinics called “Memory Clinic”, where the patient is seen by a team of different specialists such as neurologist, psychiatrist and neuropsychologist. The patient undergoes a series of clinical (neurological and gait examination) and neuropsychological tests as well as a brain MRI (if no contra-indications) and/or PET Scan (depending on the presentation). The diagnosis of dementia is then discussed in a team composed of all the specialists.  In the last decades, the use of biomarkers (molecules which are specific “markers” of a disease) in the cerebrospinal fluid for example are investigated as potential “markers” to diagnose a specific dementia related conditions. This has however still to be confirmed in the next decades. It is of course difficult to draw a conclusion on what happened to you but I hope that the above points brought some clarifications. Additionally, bear in mind that memory is a complex cognitive function that relies on elaborated neuronal cortical networks and is influenced by other cognitive functions such as for example attention. A lack of attention or concentration can impact on the process of memory. This can for example happen in stress situation or emotional situation. Finally, some drugs may also interfere with the process of memory. As such, there are other possible factors that could explain some “blackouts”, that probably many individuals experience without necessarily suffering from dementia.
If, in the previous mentionned points, you see a so called "red flag" (problems in other cognitive areas, impact on social or occupational functioning, risk factors such as positive family history) which concerns your own history, you may wish to consider seeing your family doctor.

This effect has been observed both after a single meal and over 24h. The effect of protein on satiety may be dependent on the type of protein ingested (animal protein, whey vs casein) The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying satiety after protein intake seem to include stimulation of gastrointestinal hormones that affect gastrointestinal motility. Additionally, some studies suggest that ghrelin concentration, a hormone involved in regulation of food intake, might change in response to protein intake.

Quality and quantity of sleep is affected by ageing. As a consequence, elderly individuals often show excessive daytime sleepiness.  The literature provides a very thorough list of possible cause of decreased quality and quantity of sleep with age, most common causes though seem to be related to chronic diseases such as joint diseases and chronic pains but also cardiac and pulmonary diseases. Concerning the latter, patients with pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases may suffer from sleep apnea (you can test this by answering the “Epworth Sleepiness Scale”, available on the internet). Your questions provides to few details to answer this, and maybe you should check with your family doctor. Also, some medications have been linked to sleep disturbances such as beta-blockers and diuretics (which are often prescribed in the case of heart problems).  However, sleep disturbances may also affect elderly individuals who are in good health. In the last decades, several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the alteration in circadian rhythm in the elderly. For example, one of the organ involved in circadian rhythm synchronisation, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, shows a decline in its function with age. Also, age is associated with a decrease in melatonin, a hormone essential in the regulation of circadian rhythm. As you can see there are many reasons for day sleepiness in the elderly. If your daytime sleepiness impacts on your daily life (and on your social activities), you may wish to consider seeing your family doctor. Sources:Cooke JR, Ancoli-Israel S.

Upper respiratory tract infections (URI) can be caused by multiple virus families such as the rhinovirus (the most common cause of URI), the influenza virus, the coronavirus and the adenovirus. While most of the URI share similar manifestations like rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough and sore throat, some symptoms may be much likely associated with a specific type of virus: myalgia and fatigue are commonly seen in influenza and parainfluenza infections, while conjunctivitis are often linked to adenovirus infection. In general cases, URI are self limited diseases. However, some patients (children aged less than 1 year and adults aged more than 65 years, pregnant woman, and people of any age with comorbid illnesses) are at risk of developing complications.

Google search for "low-carb diet" "peripheral neuropathy" yields close to zero relevant results, so vitamin deficiencies related to such diet also do not seem to be common.  deficiency--which should not be caused by a low carb diet--can also cause tingling (and weakness and cramps), but not burning pain.

7177	7196	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7196	The effect of salt consumption has been assessed in several studies (for a review: Cappuccio FP. Cardiovascular and other effects of salt consumption. Kidney International Supplements. 2013;3(4):312-315. doi:10.1038/kisup.2013.65.) Dietary salt intake has been linked to several diseases, more frequently cardiovascular diseases but also kidney stones and bone metabolism. According to its last guidance, the WHO recommends max 5 grams of salt per day ( ) Nowadays it is quite simple to exceed these recommendations through the consumption of processed foods. While obviously you try to cook yourself, be aware that other processed foods such as snack foods, soy sauce and cheese contain high content of salt. A recent interesting study has shown that dietary salt can influence postprandial plasma sodium concentration (in medicine, sodium plasma concentration expressed in mmol/L is the preferred measure for expressing the amount of sodium in blood) and influence blood pressure ( ). While the symptoms you describe are difficult to categorise, and seeing your family physician probably makes sense, some of the symptoms might be due for example to increased blood pressure. Checking your blood pressure is certainly relevant. In your story, I note that your symptoms often arise after having had beers at the pub. Bear in mind, that alcohol consumption can impact on your sleep quality as suggested by a literature review conducted among 107 articles (Stein MD, Friedmann PD. Disturbed Sleep and Its Relationship to Alcohol Use. Substance abuse : official publication of the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse. 2005;26(1):1-13.) Seeking a professional is certainly a good idea, as according to the US preventive services task force, every adult aged 18 years or older should have their BP measured at least once and rescreened every 3 to 5 years ( ). Whether your  blood electrolytes concentration need to be measured or other investigations undertaken, should be decided by your family doctor.	2016-06-23 17:24:23Z	M. Arrowsmith	2

7169	7200	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7200	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme that protects red blood cell against oxidative damage. G6PD deficiency is one the most common genetic disorders. Most of the patients with G6PD deficiency remain clinically asymptomatic. However they are at increased risk of developing acute haemolytic anemia (AHA) in the presence of oxidative agents, which can be either fava beans, infections and drugs. Considering that infection can precipitate acute haemolytic anemia, which can in some case have severe outcomes, vaccination would confer a solid way to prevent this.  The question asks about any contraindications for vaccinations in G6PD deficient patients. Consulting the Vaccine Contraindications and Precautions provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ) did not mention G6PD deficiency as proven contraindications for vaccination. Additionally, a search in Medline (a biomedical literature referencing more than 26 millions citations from journals and online books) does not seem to provide any studies or case report concerning the occurrence of adverse events in G6PD deficient patient after immunisation either. One study advocated hepatitis A vaccination in patient with G6PD deficiency in order to prevent damaging consequences from intravascular hemolysis precipitated by acute hepatitis A infection in two children with G6PD deficiency. So far, there seems to be a lack of evidence against vaccination in G6PD patients. Like in many cases in medicine, the benefits of vaccination should be balanced with its possible adverse events.

7070	7077	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7077	A toric lens is the type that is used to treat astigmatism, not an aspheric lens. An aspheric lens is primarily designed to correct for the spherical aberration of the contact lens itself, the spherical aberration of the combination of the cornea and lens of the eye, or both.  A toric lens is shaped like a slice of the side of a torus. It has a different index of refraction along its horizontal axis than it does along its vertical axis, with a smooth gradient of the refractive power in the quadrants between those axes. Astigmatism is the condition where the corneal surface, the lens of the eye, or both have the same kind of difference in refractive power along the horizontal and vertical axes of the eye. The toric lens's corrective axes must line up correctly with the astigmatic axes of the eye. A common method of accomplishing this is by making the lens heavier near one part of the edge so that the heavy edge self-rotates to the bottom. An aspheric lens, on the other hand, has a gradually changing refractive index moving radially from the edge of the lens to the center. It will either be "flatter" or "steeper" than a purely spherical lens, but the refractive index is constant moving along any circumferential path at a constant radius from the center of the lens. The magnitude of the lens's deviation from being purely spherical is known as its spherical aberration. An aspheric corrective lens is used to correct for the inherent spherical aberration that a spherically-surfaced contact lens introduces, which is directly proportional to its sphere power, and ideally also the spherical aberration of the eye itself.   Simply by the properties of optics, the effect of using either of these types of lenses if one does not have the corresponding visual defect the lens was designed to correct would be to introduce some degree of distortion into one's vision. This could only negatively affect visual acuity, though how severely would depend on the particular lens's strength. I could not find any references as to whether there are any long-term harmful effects of intentionally distorting a person's vision or visual acuity since the subject of all the references I checked was trying to achieve the opposite effect. The only mechanism I can postulate that could potentially cause damage to the eye would be by the long-term eye strain induced by the intentional distortion of a person's vision. Here are two helpful references I found in further elaborating the above information:

You cannot cure asthma with any of those two methods, but it can lead to bettering of the symptoms and it gets easier to deal with asthmatic attacks, when you know some techniques that help you get over an asthmatic attack.  Concepts, that are used: I'd recomment to find a competent yoga instructor, who can provide you with more information and can lead you through some exercises. I have worked with long-term patients, who profitted from weekly sessions and exercising at home daily. Sessions can last between only a few minutes up to an hour, where the above mentioned concepts are combined.
E.g. you start on your back and get conscious of your breathing. afterwards you are lying on your right side, lay your arm over your head, so the left ribcage is stretched and you do a breathing technique(pranayama). after a few minutes you turn on your back and feel teh difference between your two body sides and how your breathing has changed. then do the same exercise for your other side.

7049	7059	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7059	Coca-cola contains a lot of calories but very few nutrients, foods like that are called "empty calories". There is harm to the body due to regularly consuming empty calories alone. If the ratio of useful nutrients per consumed calorie goes down then that means that you would have to consume more calories to get the same amount of nutrients, which is then likely to cause weight gain. Even at the same calorie intake you may experience weight gain due to getting in less nutrients that the body needs for metabolism. The body also needs anti-oxidants to get rid of free radicals produced in metabolic processes and you'll get less of these per consumed calorie. So, the best way to think about the harm is to consider that the fundamental source of the harm is not coca cola but it's due to simply being alive. A living organism is a very complex machine that needs to repair itself constantly. To do this, it needs to have a steady supply of many different raw materials. If you feed it a lot of fuel without these raw materials then simply cranking up the metabolism to match the fuel consumption to the fuel intake would do a lot of damage. What happens instead is that a fraction of the extra fuel is stored instead of burned while the metabolism is cranked up a bit. This limits the damage, the storage would allow the extra fuel to be burned safely if you would eat more vitamins and minerals later. However, if this is a chronic situation, then you'll end up burning energy in a dirtier way on the long term.

Then, blood is carried from the liver by hepatic veins to vena cava inferior which leads to the right atrium of the heart. The heart pumps the blood into the whole body (including the liver) and substances in the blood go round and round being metabolised in each turn. If a substance enters the body in any way other than the digestive system, it gets to the heart and goes round and round through the whole body, including the liver and each time it passes the liver gets metabolised. The thing is that the substances reach the heart and enter systemic circulation   they reach the liver - the first pass effect is bypassed. Hence, I can't find research that supports your friend's wrong claim, but there are plenty of resources that refute it. For instance: from: Susan M. PondThomas N. Tozer,  , Clinical Pharmacokinetics, 1984 A clinically significant aside: medicines that show extensive first pass metabolism sometimes cannot be used perorally. This is a case with nitroglycerin, e.g. This is why it is often used sublingually, i.e the tablet is placed under the tongue, but should not be swallowed. This way the first-pass metabolism is bypassed, but the medicine is still extensively metabolised by the liver, as soon as it reaches it. There are also intravenous and transdermal forms, but the sublingual form is interesting because although it is something you "put into your mouth" the effect your friend is talking about is bypassed.	2017-06-12 01:42:24Z	Lucky	4

Probably about 100 million people before him over the last 10,000 years got even drunker and survived just fine without medical attention. If by "a bottle" you mean a 750 ml bottle and he drank half, or 375 ml of it, then he drank about 8.5 "shots" (a standard US shot is  ). I believe   to be as accurate as any calculator can be without a breath or blood sample. Given that he drank 90-proof liquor rather than standard 80-proof whiskey, I told the calculator that he drank 10 shots rather than eight. So when I entered his male gender, 180 pounds, and 10 shots of whiskey in less than half an hour, the calculator says his blood alcohol content would have been approximately .25.  will give you an idea how drunk .25 is. In short, it's falling down, stupid, puking, blacking out drunk for a novice like your friend. His death would most likely come from falling down a flight of stairs or passing out and choking on his own vomit rather than the alcohol toxicity itself. (With a chronic alcoholic it might not even be obvious they've been drinking.) Many people reach levels much higher than .25 on a daily basis, receive absolutely no medical treatment, and survive just fine.

There is no evidence that low carb diets will do you any good except if you are (pre)diabetic. It's not good science to do studies on prediabetic obese people, put them on a low carb ketogenic diet, measure the improvement in insulin sensitivity and then conclude that carbs are bad. That's as stupid as saying that strenuous exercise is bad for the heart because the condition of heart failure patients worsens when put on a strenuous exercise routine. The real evidence on carbs and fats points to the complete opposite direction. A high carb, low fat diet actually improves insulin sensitivity and has many other health benefits, particularly for the cardiovascular system.  : These Ugandans only got about 20% of less of their energy from fats, they were eating mostly a plant based diet. Human physiology is adapted to get most of the energy from carbs. Our ancestors living in Africa had to do without butter and oil, they would be filling their stomachs with energy from starches and fruits. You only need a small amount of the essential fatty acids Omega-6 and Omega-3, of the order of a few grams per day. There is plenty of other evidence for this. E.g. Evidence from autopsies on US soldiers killed in action in Vietnam shows that 80% had the early signs of atherosclerosis, while only about 3% of the North Vietnamese killed in action showed such signs. The main difference is the diet, the North Vietnamese were eating a plant based diet where most of their energy came from carbs. An intervention study by Dr. Esselstyn done on heart patients who could not be operated and were deemed to be terminally ill, resulted in most of these patients reversing their symptoms and living for many more years without symptoms,  . The opposite claim that a low carb high fat diet is good for health has arguably been falsified in a huge trial. The North American population has put itself on this diet, decreasing the amount of carbs relative to the amount of fats ever more. The result?   People in their 40s are  dying from heart disease, teenagers are getting type 2 diabetes. So, to conclude, what's bad for you is the ketogenic diet itself, not so much the oil you want to use for this diet.	2016-06-04 05:53:00Z	Count Iblis	1

Suppose that your magnesium intake is too low compared to your calorie intake. Then the body will tend to store the calories in the form of fat, as it needs magnesium to burn calories.

Let me tell you some key points. If she is worried too much she'll start producing   in her body. I was worried about a spot in my mouth for 2 years and had misdiagnosed it as leukoplakia using google. As a result I developed chronic neck pain. Never let her do that. Google often provides links to websites with   information about a disease intended for the general public and NOT proper medical websites. A lump in the throat is actually normal as lymph nodes are present there. If it was cancer indeed, 5 years would have been ample time for the tumor to grow in size and cause fever and all other cancer symptoms. Health anxiety is not something you can completely get rid off. It's only a moment of time before you discover some new virus over the internet that spreads through touching/sneezing and start obsessing about it. You need to tell her to relax and make her believe that the human body is more complex and well suited to fight infection and diseases than she knows. Just google the placebo (also nocebo) effect and tell her read about it. It proves how powerful can human psychology be when it comes to physical well-being. To a hypochondriac repeated reassurance is required because they tend to fall into a cycle of constant worrying and re-analysing the cause of their worry. The key to overcome this is to break this cycle. Practicing meditation on a daily basis helps calm the mind and allows it to think more clearly. Also meditation helps you to analyse yourself in a quieter way. That way you learn to control your anxieties. I will strongly recommend   for video-guides to meditation and hypnosis. Begin with  .

It's likely that whenever she feels that something doesn't feel quite right and the idea that this could be cancer crosses her mind, she doesn't have enough knowledge to dismiss such thoughts on their merit. If she is taught about this, then she can start to suppress such thoughts. But it will then still take some time before these negative thoughts will stop to cross her mind. This is because such thoughts originate at the subconscious level, the brain parts involved can flag that something seems to be wrong even if you at the conscious level know that there is no problem and that this is false alarm. The alarm will then still be there but she can ignore it, as long as she knows that it is indeed false alarm. The reason why this is going on is because by believing in what she felt she amplified the signals which have had the effect of programming certain brain parts to act this way. These brain parts don't know that this is a bad thing. If she had been learning a new skill then the same sort of processes would have led her to become better at performing that skill. Since the wrong programing is still present, this means that even when she knows that simply feeling something somewhere in her body does not mean she has cancer, the signals she perceives will still be amplified and felt in an exaggerated way. She needs to appreciate this effect in order to continue to be able to dismiss the idea that she may have cancer. But lowering stress levels simply by not believing that she has cancer and also relaxation methods as mentioned in Sona's answer will already go some way to reduce whatever abnormality she is perceiving.	2016-05-31 01:10:12Z	Count Iblis	5

A common denominator though seems to be blood flow,  which makes sense considering the importance of keeping the brain properly oxygenated. Too little blood to the head and you can lose consciousness (which evolutionarily is very bad, because an unconscious monkey can't defend itself or its kin). Too much blood and you risk improper brain function in the best case, and hemorrhaging into the delicate brain tissues in the worst. For this reason and others, blood vessels in and leading into the head are often covered in nerves. Major changes in blood flow putting pressure on these nerves can cause headaches. Glyceryl trinitrate patches work so well for angina because nitroglycerin is converted in the body to nitric oxide, one of the body's own primary vasodilators, and vasodilators serve the role of causing blood vessels to widen.  In the chest, this widening helps the heart to function. In the head — which the nitroglycerin eventually reaches as it is systemically absorbed — vasodilation allows blood vessels to hit these nerves, and there's your headache.

Low-carb dieting has side benefits for ultra-endurance athletes (increase in intramuscular triglycerides), but can negatively impact high intensity strength training by reducing muscle glycogen and forcing the body to convert protein into glucose, rather than use it for muscle building.

This is understandable since the pollution effect in crowded places or near highly exposed places is equivalent to 3-10 passively smoked cigarettes/day (see   for an article about air pollution effect near an Amsterdam freeway). Your concern being about one cigarette/month, you can see it is truly negligible compared to air pollution concerns for example. That's why there are no studies about this. However, one should acknowledge a last thing. Daily life, involving simple things such as walking under shining sun, exposes us to hazard. Our body is made to be adapted to it, and handles it fairly well (otherwise humanity would have already been annihilated by viruses, skin cancer etc). When one smokes, he increases the risk for his body to develop bad things. Even though the risk is much lower in that case (1cigarette/month), it is still present.

The excitation-contraction coupling(as the sequence of electrical activation an muscle contraction is officially called) , is not always a guarantee. A cardiac arrest in many cases mirrors severe malfunction on the level of the micro-structures of the heart and a biochemical disarray in general. If you don't restore the pumping of the heart in seconds to minutes(even if this is crude and primitive-looking), the patient may not only die, but even worse they may "live" with severely depressed or completely absent brain function. The only way, a "modern" way  would help a "stopped" heart is if some futuristic nano-device could be employed rapidly to either correct micro anatomy and microphysiology in minutes, or replace and collaborate with the patient's native structures. However , primitive it may seem to you , external manual compressions, if properly performed can make the difference (at a great percentage) between life and death. The "electrical current- modern" approach works for patients with severe arrhythmias or conduction problems. In these cases the "mechanical part" of the heart is intact and you only replace the electrical function of a problematic conduction system or problematic natural pacemakers. Even in this case, a properly performed placement of a temporary pacemaker is an awkward process that can take several minutes until successful(transcutaneous or transvenous)placement is established. If the patient is asystolic or almost asystolic(no-pulse) , "primitive " compressions should be done until the pacemaker safely paces. Unless a super enhanced swarm of nano-machines, that can navigate safely through the human body and correct problems rapidly and at will, emerges ,no "sophisticated machines" will replace manual compressions. In fact, during resuscitation they have been proven much more valuable than artificial breathing, which is reflected in the change in the guidelines during the past 15 years.	2016-07-17 10:25:40Z	michaelpri	3

We cannot do without glucose, e.g. brain cells need to use glucose, they cannot burn fat. When we run out of glucose, we can generate glucose by breaking down proteins, which leads to a loss of muscle mass.

In fact, watching shows involving CPR and defibrillation is a source of both amusement and frustration for most medical professionals because it is almost always portrayed wildly inaccurately. Defibrillation is effective against only ventricular fibrillation (VF or V-Fib, which is when the heart is beating too irregularly for effective blood circulation too occur) and   ventricular tachycardia (VT or V-Tach, which is when the heart is beating too fast for effective circulation). Automated defibrillators simply will not shock other rhythms, including asystole ("flat line"). No one trained to use a manual defibrillator would do so either. Yes, a defibrillator can definitely stop a beating heart. However, if that heart started out healthy and hasn't been injured, then it's quite likely it will restart on its own due to the   of cardiac cells. This is why   can be used to treat arrhythmias with relative safety. A cardioversion is simply a defibrillation of the heart timed to coincide precisely with a safe point in the heart rhythm.  Interestingly, there was even one case of an  . Had the nurse followed his training and applied the paddles to his chest instead of his head, he might have succeeded. Although the "it can't hurt" logic is tempting, the fact is that inappropriate defibrillation   hurt. If the patient is in asystole, defibrillation merely reduces the already very small chances of restoring a heartbeat. If the patient is in some rhythm other than VF or VT, defibrillation may stop their heart, or put them into VF or VT. It simply isn't done no matter what you might see on Doogie Howser, MD.

5868	5869	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5869	The WBC to platelet ratio is not a commonly used index in medicine, and does not have any general significance. For example, infection, hematological malignancies, or solid organ tumors can all cause low or high WBC and low or high platelet count  . There is one study   looking at a specific population (patients undergoing splenectomy for trauma) showing that a lower platelet to WBC count ratio can be helpful to differentiate patients developing an infection from noninfected patients. The rationale behind this is that trauma patients often have a high WBC count (leukocytosis due to stress demargination of neutrophils), such that the WBC count is no longer reliable as an indicator of infection. Therefore, this study combined the WBC count with the platelet count, which initially goes down in most patients with infection  , to try to improve discrimination between the two conditions. The generalizability of this index is extremely limited since the patient population studied was quite specific. There is also one study   that showed that platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (note that lymphocyte count only represents a subset of WBC count) correlates with prognosis in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

The recommendations vary from country to country, but a rule of thumb is a maximal amount of 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for women. However, there is more and more evidence that there is no "safe" level of alcohol intake, and that any alcohol intake increases the risk of a range of cancers  . Making this more complicated is that there is also data showing that people who drink a moderate amount of alcohol have lower mortality  . Therefore, it's unclear whether it would be "advisable" to resume alcohol consumption. The jury is still out on whether it's safe to drink alcohol regularly.  In the event that the pancreatitis was caused by alcohol consumption, then it would be necessary to evaluate whether the person has alcohol use disorder. If the person is diagnosed with this condition, then it would be of course unadvisable for him or her to resume any amount of alcohol consumption.

5861	10413	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10413	I also tried to search for any formal information about the product's contents and composition, but couldn't find anything, probably because it is a generic product sold at a supermarket.
At any rate, this kind of composition (capsule, pellets and tablet) seems to form the mechanism for the 'delayed release' of Omeprazole, as written on the package.
 Omeprazole is a drug with a rather short half-life (0.5-1 hour according to  ). This means that without any intervention in its pharmacokinetics (absorption, elimination time), it will start working in reducing stomach acid rather quickly - Immediate-release Omeprazole should be taken shortly (about 30 minutes) before eating, in order to reduce stomach acid prior to or during eating. Now, although Omeprazole's effect is in the stomach, it needs to be protected from the acidic content of the stomach, where it passes before it is absorbed into the blood. After passing the stomach, it is absorbed into the blood and then reaches the parietal cells of the stomach lining and exerts its effect. In order to make Omeprazole more friendly to the patient, and remove the need to take it only half an hour before eating (thus imposing limitations on the patient and increasing the risk of improper use that might lead to heartburn), delayed-release formulations have been developed. Their main difference and advantage is that the patient does not have to take the capsule only before eating - once he takes the capsule, its contents are   released in the body (more slowly than the immediate release formulation), thus providing a delayed effect throughout the day. That is why delayed-release Omeprazole should only be taken once a day (usually in the morning). The delayed release mechanism is comprised of the pellets and the tablet. The pellets, being smaller, start to disintegrate and release the active ingredient Omeprazole before the tablet (but only after passing through the stomach, since they are enteric-coated as mentioned before). Meanwhile the tablet starts to dissolve, disintegrate and release the active ingredient, but this happens more slowly. After many calculations, it was possible to formulate the capsule and its contents in such a way that one capsule covers an entire day (24 hours). This enables the patient to take one capsule in the morning and act as usual, without worrying about getting heartburn after eating. As I said in the beginning, I was unable to find formal documentation for this mechanism of delayed release, but the   in Walmart's website seem to point in that direction (see page 7; please note that these answers are most probably not provided by professionals, but by customers and others). See also definition no. 2  , which also seems to apply for this capsule's composition.

So it can't be anything that is designed to have an active effect on the body. Also magnesium is not listed as an inactive ingredient anywhere, so we can count that out. If I were to bet I'd say it's just lactose and filler (which is listed under the inactive ingredients and there's basically no volume for it to be in the granules) to give the capsule weight and aid in swallowing/handling. With just the granules the capsule might not have much weight and make consumers think it's empty or not filled correctly or get stuck in the throat more easily. The enteric coated granules definitely contain the active drug according to every source I could find. 	2016-08-22 21:10:44Z	TheChinBurglar	0

5857	5897	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5897	This is a very interesting case. First things first, we should determine why one moves and how one moves. The concerning brain area is the primary motor cortex. As you probably know is the human body controlled by electrical pulses, so-called action potentials. These control your body and are sent out by the brain (very simplified). You should read a few paragraphs before proceeding reading if you don't know about action and resting potential anymore. As I believe that you are someone who is competent to use Google, I tell you that I haven't found anything related to cramps and mental willpower as well. But I found something else which sparked my interest. This research is phenomenal, suggesting that thinking about exercising can attenuate muscle loss and could even promote hypertrophy. You may ask now what this has to do with your case. Of course, what now follows is but pure speculation but I guessed that I could try. If we pair the findings above mental exercise and the reasons behind a cramp and the information of what we know of action and resting potential, we could conclude that thinking about a muscle area in particular promotes movement and simple action in it. As a cramp is defined as a contracted muscle which is not able to relax, thinking about it might promote movement and action in it once again, resulting in the satisfying feeling of getting rid of the cramp. It's important to know that you usually move subconsciously - you don't think too much about grabbing this one glass of water, walking around the corner or getting in and out of the bus. This is all done by your subconscious in order to keep your attention fixated on something more important. Imagine if you think about moving your muscles all day, we would live a life with information overload where we can't think of the important things. So figuratively speaking, the following happens: Your commando center has a Commander-In-Chief, you, and a lot of subordinates. One for moving your legs, one for keeping your heart beating, one for getting embarrassed, one for simple walking and many more. Of course, every subordinate needs to learn their trade and this is done by practicing. So, especially in your childhood, your subordinates are eager to learn. You, the Commander-In-Chief, still always have the right of way - if you say something, your subordinates do so. So it happens that one of your subordinates makes a mistake, for example biting your cheek while eating, and you, the Commander-In-Chief, are left with the consequences. So you think about it, get angry at yourself and hope that your subordinate, your subconscious, has learned it. The same goes for a cramp. A subordinate wasn't wary enough and a cramp occurs because of one of the many reasons (overuse of muscle, dehydration, muscle strain, etc.  ). Oh snap! The subordinate is overloaded and you have to handle it by enforcing your electrical signals on this very specific point in your arm and, voíla, your arm is able to move again because you ordered your little army of electrical impulses to go to this specific point to isolate the problem. As earlier stated, there is absolutely no scientific basis for this and neither I'm a physician nor a researcher so take this with a grain of salt. But I hope to have given you at least one idea of what might happen.	2016-05-22 13:06:21Z	Zerotime	1

Assuming you take the melatonin at least 3 hours before you plan to get up, you will have covered around 4 half-lives at the minimum, which would result in a serum level of 6.25% of your peak level. At levels that low, any sleepiness you feel would be mostly due to having just woken up, and not any residual effects of the melatonin. The study also mentions that slow release preparations can keep serum levels high for 5-7 hours, so I would not recommend driving/working after taking one of those.

But, since you have given a detailed explanation why you don't think it would work for you, I hope this answer will help you and other who have a similar question in refuting the arguments you gave. In short,  : Working with a therapist to resolve shyness, social anxiety or anything else that might be the problem isn't about your interaction with the professional as a new person and practicing on them in a safe environment. It is about finding the root of the problem and finding ways to solve or mitigate it by methods that the practitioner has been trained to use. It might seem like an ordinary conversation/social interaction, but it is not, and a layperson cannot do it instead of a therapist. Among many techniques that exist, a well-known one is   also known as  . Whether this is the right one for you, I can't say over the internet, but a therapist who sees you in person can. From  : Based on your description this seems like something you are looking for.  You asked about a pill or a supplement. There have been studies with those as well, but   by Irving B. Weiner, W. Edward Craighead states that:  If your opinion that you need medication or supplements persists, you would still need to get a prescription or at leas a recommendation from a therapist, so if you already go to see one, why not try a pharma-free option first? If need be, your therapist can always add the medication. I should mention that there are self-help options, primarily books on the market, but while they might offer valuable advice they can't monitor your progress and adjust the advice and methods accordingly, while a therapist can and this is exactly what they do. A form of middle-ground might be computerised CBT. If you opt for therapy in person (the best option IMO) you can choose between group and individual therapy. Sometimes it might take a while to find a form of therapy or a therapist that suits you (people are different) the key is to be persistent and not to give up. Best of luck! 	2016-05-22 23:19:42Z	Lucky	4

I want to share some personal experience with you. Most of the symptoms you described (both mental and physical) are familiar to my own. 
First, I totally agree with Lucky. Seeing a therapist/psychologist is in my honest opinion the best thing to do. This person can help in the form of giving exercises, advice or just listening to you. It doesn't matter that you can get used to him/her. That comfort might help you to talk more openly and get to the source of your problem. Your age is not important IMHO. The people in my therapy group ranged from age 20 to 65. 
I think using supplements/pills should be a last resort. Those might help you in the moment but are not a long time solution. Try training to control your emotions and get help doing so. This is much more fulfilling and helpful. Using something like a pill to gain that control seems a bit like suppressing to me. I'm certainly not a therapist/psychologist but I believe you should learn to handle the emotions you're experiencing properly. It takes some work and time, and it might not be easy but it's worth it. You will start noticing that you converse with more and more ease overtime. This will also help you regain confidence because it will be something you achieved yourself. Supplement and pills will not address any underlying problems you might have. They will continue to exist and you will only treat the symptoms. 
But then again, I'm not a professional so get the opinion of an expert on this matter. I had group therapy and occasionally spoke with a psychologist. Together we came to the source of my social anxiety and started to work on it. A year later (after a year of therapy), I still have some anxious moments now and then but they are less intense and don't last that long anymore. My point is that, while therapy takes more work, it outweighs the 'quick fix' that pills and supplements offer by far. 
I hope this helps and the best of luck.	2016-05-26 09:45:06Z	Iarwain	3

5818	5849	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5849	In medicine we aim to base everything on solid scientific results. We call this practice "evidence based medicine" (EBM). What we call "alternative medicine" are all the alternative approaches where such standards are not or insufficiently implemented. The way medicine used to be practiced centuries ago is a good example of alternative medicine, we usually refer to this as  : Now nutrition, while an integral part of the regular medical discipline (if you get diagnosed with diabetes, your endocrinologist may well refer you to a dietitian) fits in well within traditional medicine in the following sense. The knowledge we have about the food we eat has been passed on from generation to generation long before modern science came into existence. Basically, you've been told to eat your vegetables by your mother who was told the same by her mother etc. etc, you could probably trace this back to the time before modern humans even existed. When applying rigorous scientific standards to nutrition we then face a problem. How do we even define the problem when evaluating foods we eat? E.g. broccoli is not some drug designed to solve some specific medical problem, so you don't have a well defined end point that you can test. It's of course, not a problem in principle to study some particular health effects of certain foods. In practice this can already be difficult, you can't perform double blind tests, so you need to resort to observational studies or controlled experiments that typically won't last very long. But the real problem is then the choice of the end point for health outcomes and the choice for what to compare the food item to. You can't e.g. simply look at all cause mortally. Suppose e.g. that   would prevent prevent cancer and heart disease, if you stick to that diet you'll live a lot longer (assuming it would really work). But then it turns out that you'll have a lack of energy, you'll end up sleeping 12 hours a day. So, the end point of all cause mortality which looks to be a good criterion, could well lead to totally worthless result. But to even get such results, you must make a decision to compare one type of diet to another diet. In older statistical studies dating back from the 1980s and earlier the mistake was made to just correlate intake of nutrients to health. As explained   this often leads to spurious results, as total energy intake is a huge confounding factor. Modern studies do the statistical analysis in such a way that total energy intake is taken into account. But there may be other confounding factors lurking which may not be as easily identified and dealt with. Now, the fact remains that if you today stick to what passes for a healthy diet, then you would be eating a diet that your great great great grandmother would probably also consider to be a healthy diet. So, even if we today know a bit more than your great great great grandmother (take e.g. vitamins), the information that describes what you would be eating  still largely derives from ancient knowledge. Modern science has had only a limited impact here. E.g. we now know that saturated fats may not be very healthy. On the other hand, a mistake was made when we wrongly thought we could produce healthier fats, trans fats were made as a healthier alternative to saturated fats, but this turned out to be much more damaging to our health. So, at the end of the day, the patient who gets referred to a dietitian will end up being put on a diet that has its origins in what we could call traditional medicine. The healthy foods the patient would be eating like carrots cauliflowers, broccoli were created not as a result of moderns scientific efforts but they were cultivated more than 3000 years ago. 	2016-05-19 01:13:30Z	Count Iblis	1

Eating less could help you remember more and boost your brain power, too. Scientists from the   in Rome investigated ‘calorific restriction’, a theory that near-starvation rations help boost health and memory. The study, published in the  , tested the theory on lab rats and found that cutting back the calories by 25 - 30% (around 600 calories a day) helped boost the production of the memory and learning protein, CREB1. “It is just 25 to 30 per cent fewer calories. It is like not eating a cake at the end of the meal. This gives us a tool to better investigate this brain circuitry and try to figure out more drugs that do the same,” says lead researcher Dr. Giovambattista Pani, from the study. “We are trying a couple of compounds right now on animals but it is at a very preliminary stage. Our findings identify for the first time an important mediator of the effects of diet on the brain. This discovery has important implications to develop future therapies to keep our brain young and prevent brain degeneration and the ageing process. “Our hope is to find a way to activate CREB1, for example through new drugs, so to keep the brain young without the need of a strict diet,” Dr. Pani added. While eating less helps increase brainpower, drinking more also has its benefits. Well, more coffee that is, as this helps up the CREB1 levels. But it’s not all about what you eat (or rather, what you don’t eat…) as another study suggests that the key to a good memory could soon lie in a ‘memory-boosting pill‘.	2016-11-28 08:12:05Z	Prince	1
5804	5807	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5807	Somehow today I had a bit more luck in addressing my own question.  It seems that many of the online blood testing services do offer tests on a disaggregated basis.  Their more popular products are bundled tests that include some of the typical overall blood tests for an annual physical.  But, several of those enterprises also offer unbundled tests of more esoteric yet very important tests such as for C-Reactive protein and Fibrinogen.  The latter is a very good check to see how granular can you go in terms of specific independent blood tests you can order from such services.  Today, I found two companies that passed that check.  One is Accesa Labs that operates through Quest Diagnostics.  The other one is Health Tests Direct (HTD).  HTD is actually very interesting because they operate through both Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp.  As a result, HTD allows you to do some comparative shopping in terms of test prices between those two market leaders.   Although the above answer is reasonably inclusive, it does not preclude that others may uncover specific companies that could be equal if not superior to the two I mentioned above.  This is a short update as of December 2017.  As we know Theranos has run into all sorts of legal and regulatory troubles since I first wrote this answer.  They are now I think very much out of this business.  After considering many online lab testing providers I recently chose Personalabs.com.  They allowed you to select your blood test on a disaggregated basis as well as any other online competitors.  What differentiated them is that their website and their blood test selections were so much clearer than competitors.  They operated through Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp just like the other better services.  Interestingly enough, I got my lab test results through Personalabs.com within 5 days.  Yet, over 10 days later, I still could not get the same from Quest Diagnostics (QD).  I am still interested in getting the results from QD just to check that their interpretation of the results (healthy acceptable range of values) are the same as for Personalabs.    	2016-05-13 21:05:53Z	Sympa	5

The key considerations as the pregnancy progresses is to make sure that accessibility to clinical care is not impeded. For example, I don't recommend going into deepest darkest Africa when you are nine months pregnant. With that said, pregnant women are at special risk for developing some conditions. One risk is for deep vein thrombosis, which is a life-threatening clot in deep veins that can lead to death. Due to the weight of the fetus, it can compress some deep veins in the pelvis and impede circulation. As a result, I highly recommend that pregnant women (and all people in general), take breaks every hour, get up and stretch, and walk around a little bit.

I'm telling you definitively that IGF-1 was not the cause of your breakout, and neither was protein. Most likely you just so happened to break out at the same time you were drinking protein shakes. Feel perfectly comfortable drinking them now. Furthermore, your body relies on the amino acids in protein to rebuild itself, and  . The fact that you're breathing right now means that you consume protein regularly. When you work out, you are causing tiny amounts of muscle damage, and the muscle building basically results from the body overcompensating as it heals the muscle.  This healing relies on these amino acids, which are taken from protein as it is broken down in digestion. You can't heal (and therefore grow) muscle without protein, just as you can't live without protein. Moral of the story: Drink protein shakes if you like, eat plenty of meat and fish if you don't.

5773	5848	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5848	Muscle atrophy doesn't have to be bad. Your body tries to fit the situation by decreasing your muscle mass and thus to decrease the needed energy to maintain your body. However, in order to prevent possible muscle atrophy, there have been several methods. In case you shouldn't know what different muscle fibers are and how they are distributed in your body, I've got you. So it's possible to prevent muscle atrophy in type II muscle fibers by simply exercising. If you suffer from a serious illness or are physically-challenged, you can maintain your muscle mass by using functional electrical stimulation. The idea is to stimulate your cells so that they keep their current state or to provoke hypertrophy. After a short search, I was able to find some experimental studies with rats to investigate muscle atrophy more deeply. It should be obvious that you shouldn't take in Clenbuterol without a consultation with your doctor and of course not solely on the results of the study. The University of Hull did some research and found out that basic stretching for 30 minutes each day can prevent muscle atrophy in immobilized muscles. I'll end up with a study regarding the loss muscle mass in the elderly and how to promote muscle hypertrophy in them. So long story short: The best way is to simply exercise to keep your muscles and yourself pumped, as @TheEnvironmentalist already said. There are indeed ways to do this by not exercising but the chemical idea as well as the functional electrical stimulation are still in progress. Nonetheless, you should read the corresponding Wikipedia article   to FES to inform yourself in this regard.	2016-05-18 20:24:39Z	Zerotime	3

So, in case you have acid reflux, the above foods may be unhealthy for you, even if they are not unhealthy by themselves.	2016-12-07 10:58:09Z	Jan	4

The acid plays a key role in the digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids. Since we now know the meaning of stomach acid, let's categorize healthy foods and unhealthy foods. So by doing that let's give an example; fruits and vegetables are considered as  , right? and junk foods, noodles, and some processed foods are unhealthy.

5658	5662	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5662	Some people simply have "looser" joints throughout their body due to less elastic connective tissue (and other causes), a condition called benign joint hypermobility. It sometimes manifests itself as a pervasive vague joint discomfort or dull soreness which may be temporarily relieved by popping or stretching the joint. The joints may also pop spontaneously such as when turning your neck or twisting your torso. In and of itself, this does not necessarily mean there is anything wrong with you as long as you're not having frequent pain, spasms, swelling, or instability of the joints. Sometimes people get so used to popping their joints to relieve that discomfort that they almost get "addicted" to it, doing it multiple times a day, which can actually start to cause inflammation in the joints. Once they limit how often they are popping their joints the worsening discomfort usually subsides, possibly aided by a short course of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine (e.g., naproxen or ibuprofen.) If you are having worse symptoms than that, it may be a different condition that does warrant being checked out by a physician.  If you do decide to get it checked out, you should probably start by seeing your primary care provider (typically a family practice or internal medicine physician, if you don't have an established medical provider.) They can evaluate your full medical history and decide if any testing, treatment, or referrals are needed. Ultimately, the medical specialist you   need to see is a rheumatologist. They diagnose and treat conditions which tend to affect multiple joints and connective tissues throughout the body, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Regarding the joint hypermobility, this link contained some useful information:  One further thought about joint hypermobility is that strengthening the muscles around the bothersome joints can make up for the joint capsule and ligament laxity and stabilize the joints, thereby lessening the symptoms.	2016-04-29 01:02:05Z	Fonebone	3

That depends on what cell it is and where it's located. Location and cell type are crucial because they determine how quickly the tumor can reproduce and/or breach organ barriers and metastasize (spread to other areas of the body). The speed of growth can be generalized by looking and the 'histology' and 'differentiation' of a cancer. The differentiation of a tumor refers to how the cells look under the microscope. Cells that look normal are termed well differentiated. On the other hand, if the cells appear very abnormal they are termed poorly differentiated. Poorly differentiated cancers tend to grow quicker than well-differentiated tumors. The histology of a tumor relates to the pattern the cells form as whole when viewed under the microscope. This influences a tumor's rate of growth and spread. For example in lung cancer, small-cell cancers tend to grow and spread very rapidly. In contrast, non-small cell lung cancer tends to grow and spread at a slower rate. There's more complexity to this, but the only real way to determine the rate of growth is to observe the patient and their cancer development over a period of time - it can vary wildly.

This happens when your blood glucose goes low in the evening.  The body compensates by releasing stored glucose from the liver.  In people without diabetes the body would simply produce more insulin and regulate their blood sugar.  In a person with diabetes the insulin is ineffective or insufficient and blood sugar remains high.   One way I had clients treat this is to have a small snack an hour before bed that had about 30g of carb, and 15 g of protein (to slow the rise of blood glucose).  This was enough to prevent the overnight low in the middle of the night and rebound high in the morning.  The more accurate gauge of how your blood sugar is doing is taking it first thing in the morning.  Hydration can affect blood glucose but not as quickly as you are describing.   Exercise however can drop blood glucose as much as 50 points depending on how high levels were before activity, duration of activity, and intensity.   	2016-04-20 21:32:04Z	DavidERD	1

So we still have to accept that these are unconfirmed reports. At present there is no controlled experimental evidence to confirm that this can happen, and biologically, it seems highly implausible that this actually does happen.  Male fertility is reduced when  , and this is when the sperm is introduced into the vagina.  A normal ejaculate contains 200 million to a billion sperm.  From these only a few reach the egg and then more then one is required to breach the corona radiata to allow a single sperm to fertilise the egg.  However, pregnancy can occur even when   is practiced since the pre-ejaculate may contain sperm.  So, this suggests that much lower numbers of sperm in the vagina then normally considered necessary can still result in pregnancy. At present there is no experimental data on the passage of sperm through clothing though one would assume it's possible. So, in summary, the evidence has not independently verified that outer-course can result in pregnancy, and is an area that requires further investigation.	2016-04-20 03:08:09Z	Graham Chiu	2

It seems that unhealthy eating is often influenced by at least one of two things: a lack of variety in food or unconsciously (or only semi-consciously) following bad routines. Here are some ideas: When it comes to self-control, it seems that awareness is a much better tool than willpower. Willpower is limited; you can only force yourself to do so much. But with a deeply ingrained experience of what is good for you and what isn't, it's unlikely that you'll have some craving to overdo it time and again. That's why it can help to do things consciously and to try many different options. While not literally food, note that drinking may also be an important factor. Drinking tap water (or pure bottled water if tap water is contaminated with anything in your area) is an important difference; if you're usually drinking anything with significant sugar/energy in it, or in fact anything that's not effectively water, I'd recommend to switch to water in a similar way to the food change: always have a glass of water at the ready; if you choose to drink something else, make sure you take time to get it and drink it consciously every time.	2016-05-03 17:53:55Z	Vandroiy	2

Since I-131 is excreted in bodily fluids and taken up into the thyroid, those susceptible populations are at increased risk for thyroid cancer if they ingest contaminated bodily fluids.  The person receiving the treatment is not because the cells that might become malignant are destroyed by the treatment. I-131 is a major product of nuclear fallout, and is thought to have contributed to significant thyroid cancer in the USA from Nevada weapons testing. I presume that distance is advised to avoid gamma radiation emitted by the I-131 in the patient's body rather then the beta radiation which would be largely confined to the thyroid gland, and to emphasize a practical distance to minimize the ingestion of any contaminated fluids. The question then arises as to what is the safe dose of gamma radiation for a person in whom there is no therapeutic benefit.  The answer has to be extrapolated from biophysics and the effect of higher doses since looking at low doses in a population requires too large a number of subjects. Since these are assumptions, the precautionary principle applies. Since the gamma radiation from the body of the treated patient can travel several meters through air, and beta radiation from excreted I-131  , then restricting the contact to outside these areas would limit unnecessary exposure.	2016-04-15 00:54:15Z	Graham Chiu	2

The health implications obviously vary depending on what the underlying diagnosis is, and in some jurisdictions some physicians   for not following up on whether these tests have been done due to patient non adherence.

The reason athletes use protein is because by exercising they damage their muscles, and protein needs to be available for a fast recovery. If you consume just the right amount of (whey) protein - you'll be fine, it is usually high in quality and has all the amino acids necessary (that protein can provide). But here we run into our first problem, you still need to consume enough fats, fibre, vitamins and minerals. So chances are, if you're not careful, you will overshoot your daily requirement of protein by eating other food (which also has some protein). Too much protein not only can overload your kidneys (which are desperately trying to get rid of the excess) but will also be stored in your body as fat. This is especially true because protein powders are very concentrated, and you don't need much of it when you're not working out. So to answer your question, it's not a bad idea if you meticulously keep track of exactly what and how much you eat per day to meet your nutrient requirements and not overshoot them. You also need to have knowledge of your body type, rate of metabolism and other factors. Its just much more inconvenient to do this when you're not working out, so I wouldn't recommend it personally.  If you were thinking a protein shake can replace a meal, then absolutely not. You could make some super-shakes containing a large fraction of the nutrients you need with some crafty planning, but you won't escape eating something along with it anyway. Do yourself a favor a find some time for a nice lunch. If you're really low on time, prep the food at home and carry it with you, but when it comes to food - be nice to yourself.

5452	5457	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5457	From  : So, according to current knowledge, the link to adverse health effects may well be mediated via other medical problems such as sleep apnea causing excessive sleepiness during the day. There is no evidence for a causal link between sleeping more during the day and a higher risk of adverse health effects. To get to such evidence, one could try to correct for a higher incidence of conditions such as sleep apnea in the group of people who sleep more during the day. But the problem with this is that not enough is known about all such risk factors which also influence sleep, so any residual effect that is left may then be due to missing some factors, or having underestimated the effect the known factors have. Also, if you find that sleeping more during the day has a positive effect, that result could be an artifact of having overcompensated for effects such as sleep apnea. A better approach would be to do an intervention study where people are asked to sleep during the day. But then one would face other problems. Many people who are not used to sleeping during the day may find it difficult to do so. Also, any negative health effects may not arise until many decades of being subjected to sleeping more during the day. The effect you end up measuring after a few years may not be consistent with long term health effects. E.g. what if sleeping during the day helps you to lower the chances of a heart attack if your arteries are clogged, but the same habit over decades increases the chances of getting such clogged arteries? That's why it's better to stick to what is known about a healthy lifestyle such as getting a lot of exercise, and going to the doctor if there are issues that prevent one from doing that. If you feel so tired and sleepy during the day that you have to sleep, then that is in itself a good reason to visit the doctor. 	2016-04-12 20:30:37Z	Count Iblis	1

I'm only talking about the important and/or long-term effects: -Vastly better dental health (depending on what your gum contains, xylitol and polytol are good components to have) -Chewing gum might exacerbate a problem for a person with some sort of Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD, TMJ) -I assume the gum you're talking about is Wrigley's Doublemint - like many gums, it contains Aspartame, which is a controversial artificial sweetener. Many industry funded studies show this substance is safe, but over 90% independent studies show adverse health effects. There are some other sweeteners too, but for the most part they don't have adverse effects, especially in chewing gum doses. Some gums just use plain sugar. -Along with the production of saliva, having something in your mouth triggers the cephalic phase - gastric, pancreatic and biliary fluids being released in your body in preparation for digestion. There's a minority of people claiming this can upset their stomach (changing the acidity), but I can't find any studies backing this statement up, and it seems like this happens to a very small amount of people anyway.  
The reason we get drowsy after a lunch is because the body draws blood away from the brain to help the digestion process. -Eating food that is easy / quick to digest will reduce this drowsiness. This also applies to amount of food eaten. In my personal experience eating light food (I buy chicken salad or an italian wrap!), and eating enough so you are just below the feeling of being 'full' helps tremendously. Try playing around with this and see if it works for you too. -A 5 minute   exercise session that will get your blood running. I use a local pull-up bar for a set or two when I have the time. This is just to 'warm up' and shouldn't be actual exercise. -Splash cold water on your face for temporary mental sharpness. -Stay hydrated, drink a lot of water. There are almost infinite reasons to stay as well hydrated as possible continuously. One of the first signs of dehydration is fatigue. Hope this helps you!

I could find a few articles containing a spectral analysis of various salts. Here is one for Himalayan pink salt: Here is the best comparison I could find, it's mostly just a summary, I couldn't locate the raw data: Of note is that while some of the coloured salts may contain higher amounts of essential elements, they also contain higher amounts of harmful elements. Although we're generally talking less than one part per million, so not enough to be of a concern, especially given the small amount you'd ingest. It's this mix of elements which gives the salts their colour.  All of these essential minerals are available in other foods, often in much higher amounts, especially considering the small amount of salt that it's recommended to have in a healthy diet. Perhaps the best salt to use is an iodised salt, especially if your food is coming from areas where levels of iodine in the soil are too low for the adequate intake, although iodised salt is also quite common in bread and some other processed foods now.	2016-04-11 01:15:47Z	Ben Cannon	1
5429	5455	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5455	I don't see a lot of difference between drinking few sips and 1 cup (8 oz, 237 mL) of water at once. If you drink a large amount of water at once, for example, 500 mL (2 cups, 16 oz), all this water will be quickly absorbed and will expand the blood volume. Volume receptors in the heart will detect an increase of blood volume and will trigger excretion of some water from the blood through the kidneys before the water could reach the body cells. This way the drinking will be less efficient than drinking smaller amounts, like 1 cup at the time. This can be true even when you are dehydrated and you, for example, miss 2 liters of water in your body (you can know that by weighing yourself). When you drink 1 liter of water at once (still only the half of the amount you miss) you may observe that you will need to urinate shortly after that (because of mechanism described above). If you drink smaller amounts, like 1 cup (237 mL) at the time, for example, 30 min apart, you have a better chance to keep a greater percent of water in your body.  is not studied by experiments, from obvious reasons, so the most knowledge about this comes from case reports and newspaper news.

If contracted through airborne particles, they primarily affect the respiratory system. Mucus, sneezing, fever, are all signs that the body is fighting an infection, as is fatigue as the body diverts resources to the immune system. Essentially, especially at a mild level it is difficult to tell the difference between these without a lab test. When it becomes serious - high fever, extreme fatigue - is it unlikely to be a cold. Any time you have these sort of symptoms you should seek medical attention, because it could be any number of other flus or viruses, some potentially life threatening, especially in small children, the elderly, or those already weakened by another condition. Allergies are a whole different thing, with a slightly different immune response, and it generally depends on how it manifests. Hayfever might produce mucus or breathing difficulty due to inflammation or muscle spasm in the airways, and can be life threatening in rare cases, even without pre-existing asthma, but it is unlikely to produce fever. I'm unsure how to reference this, as it's generally covered in a first year biology text, but the Mayo clinic is perhaps the most reliable and independent source for general medical questions.	2016-04-07 16:53:10Z	Ben Cannon	4

Unfortunately the answer is you can't do this - what determines the blood type is the presence of antigens on the surface of red blood cells. Simply put, antigens can trigger certain responses from the immune system. Here are the four types: Type A: Only the A antigen on red cells (B antibody in the plasma). The second most common blood type. Type B: Only the B antigen on red cells (and A antibody in the plasma).  Type AB: Both A and B antigens on red cells (both A and B antibody in the plasma). Type O: Neither A nor B antigens on red cells (both A and B antibody in the plasma). The most common blood type. In addition to the A and B antigens, there is a third antigen called the Rh factor, which can be either present (+) or absent ( – ). In general, Rh negative blood is given to Rh-negative patients, and both Rh positive blood or Rh negative blood may be given to Rh positive patients. It is possible to give o+ blood to an o- patient, but it carries certain risks, and is only done in very desperate situations and when the patient is beyond a certain age. If incompatible blood is given in a transfusion, the donor cells are treated as if they were foreign invaders, and the patient's immune system attacks them, which can be catastrophic. So the blood type is dependent on what's on the surface of the red blood cell, not some component that can be manipulated.

As more DNA damage accumulates, more cells in the heart (and everywhere else in the body) become dysfunctional - that's essentially what aging is. So while aging doesn't necessarily directly contribute to heart-related problems, the probability of organ failure, or dysfunctional symptoms in the organ gets higher as we age, due to more and more cells failing to perform their function.

5336	5350	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5350	Unfortunately, you can't make a probabilistic estimate if you will contract heart disease or some form of cancer - there are too many variables to consider. How big is the room? How many people are smoking? Some people smoke all their life and die without cancer or disease - though poor lung function. But I found some interesting information, we can use it to make an estimation: Enclosed smoking areas are far more toxic than exposure to second-hand smoke from bystanders outside. Anti-smoking campaigns (rightfully) tend to exaggerate a bit, if there's one person smoking one cigarette, you won't absorb four cigarettes... So my estimate is that within your 4 hours you will absorb 1-5 cigarettes worth of toxins, depending on how many people are smoking, how large the room is, and how well ventilated it is. A one-time exposure for four hours is definitely statistically negligible, but it sounds like you want to do this regularly. 4 weeks in a month are equivalent to 4-20 cigarettes smoked. In a year that's exposure equivalent to 48-240  cigarettes. Let's say you will not go to the casino three months of the year, and we take the average of that estimate. That puts you in the ballpark of 120 cigarettes a year, or 1/3rd of a cigarette per day. Clinically, smoking is estimated in pack years   and this estimate is far below a pack year - there are no studies concerning such a low amount of consumption I could find. But it still boils down to regular exposure to carcinogens, which one way or another raises your risk. Smokers go through much more tobacco, so studies are hard to find for such a low exposure, but it is definitely significant. If you go to the casino once a month for 4-5 hours you will be fine. But if you're concerned about long-term health I wouldn't go every week. Also gambling can be more addicting than tobacco. ;) Hope this estimate helps you.	2016-04-05 02:10:24Z	Coma	3

Secondhand smoke is highly diluded, by one-thousandth (1:1000) compared to the smoke inhaled directly from the cigarette by a smoker: "The most careful studies that have evaluated the actual exposure of non-smokers to tobacco smoke in the home, at work, and in other settings indicate that the average exposure of a passively exposed non-smoker is roughly equivalent to smoking about 10 cigarettes PER YEAR.  This is approximately one-thousandth the exposure of the average smoker. These studies were conducted in the 1990s, when smoking restrictions were much more limited than they are today. In view of this level of exposure, it is hardly surprising that even the best epidemiologic studies show a weak, inconsistent, or no risk."  	2016-04-22 01:59:13Z	Klaus K	1

If it is possible to calculate or estimate, how can I do this? A source would be much appreciated." A: You are at no risk of serious diseases from average exposure to secondhand smoke. According to Roger Jenkins, PhD, retired expert at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Chemical Sciences division, the average non-smoker who lives in a house with indoor smoking, inhales a little less smoke than one-thousandth of the amount of smoke inhaled by the avarage smoker:  "According to Jenkins, the typical smoker inhales 480 milligrams of smoke a day and 32 milligrams of nicotine per day. In a home where smoking is unrestricted, the typical nonsmoker will inhale the equivalent of 0.45 milligrams of smoke particles and 0.028 milligrams of nicotine." It means that while the average smoker inhales 30 cigarettes a day, 30 days a month = 900 cigarettes a month, the "passive smoker" inhales 0.9 cigarettes or roughly one (1) cigarette per month.

5334	5346	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5346	It might speed up digestion: But speeding up digestion isn't going to bring you the outcome you desire. Also, a larger amount of simple sugars is more likely to lead to increased energy stored in adipose tissue (fat cells). Big foods - those with larger, more complex molecules with stronger molecular bonds - such as more complex carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, take longer to digest, and a combination of these and fibre further slow the overall process, meaning that the energy being released into blood-sugar will be less likely to become surplus to requirements and lead to those larger spikes in blood-sugar levels which trigger storage. There are things you can do to stimulate or assist the digestive system, like chewing well to start the process, ingesting bitter foods and drinks to stimulate bile, a shot of vinegar if you have low stomach acidity, or even the sort of enzymes you find in things like lactose free milk which contains lactase (although this turns a disaccharides into two more quickly absorbed monosacharides so it's only really recommended for those who are lactose intolerant). A high fibre diet will also improve your intestinal flora long term, as well as it's short term effects on digestion. Technically an unhealthy and under-active digestive system would be more likely lead to less fat, as the body loses some of the ability to absorb macro and/or micro nutrients, meaning they pass through the system. In a depleted state, such as after prolonged starvation, or in a diabetic crash, a quick sugar hit might be needed to kick-start the system, but in general the body can easily find the energy it needs, especially for a process as slow and steady as the average 24 hours it takes to digest a meal. There are things which can reduce cholesterol re-absorption, such as increased fibre, medication, or supplements (although I've heard plant sterols as a supplement can be Sisyphean). Excess cholesterol isn't really about energy though.	2016-04-04 20:14:14Z	Ben Cannon	0

In fact, the two drugs (medicines) can be used in conjunction for a synergistic effect so that it will provide greater pain relief than either drug alone. With that said, still follow the standard dosing instructions for each drug. That means don't take more than 3000 Mg of paracetamol in one day (24 hours) (this is a strict limit, can cause permanent damage  if you exceed 4000 mg in 24 hours) and don't take more than 1200 mg of ibuprofen in any 24 hour period or you risk stomach bleeding.

The presence of dopamine at these receptors inhibits the secretion of prolactin (2). The exact level of prolactin elevation varies between antipsychotic to antipsychotic based on their affinity for the D2 receptors (2).  Tolerance can develop to this particular side effect with chronic antipsychotic 
 therapy (i.e.: it may become less pronounced over time) (1). Prolactin levels  return to base line within 2-3 weeks of discontinuation of an antipsychotic (1). Elevated prolactin levels   cause other side effects, such as bone density decrease (1)(2). However, the notion that this particular event occurs as a result of hyperprolactinemia is controversial, and may occur for other reasons such as lifestyle factors (1)(2). Decreased bone density increases the risk of bone fractures. Fractures in the spine or hip are of high concern because they can result in disability, and a higher risk of death (3). Hyperprolactinemia is associated with hypogonadism (2). Hypogonadism may prevent normal development during puberty (4). In women, there is some concern that hyperprolactinaemia may increase the risk of breast cancer (2). Although this idea is also controversial (1)(2). 	2017-09-08 09:06:08Z		1

5292	5294	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5294	As you can see lemon juice is something that can adversely affect your enamel ( ). Acid affects your teeth because it leeches calcium from them ( ). When this happens your enamel breaks down making your teeth are more vulnerable to bacteria and plaque which then leads to decay. Pure lemon juice is not something you should be downing constantly throughout the day if you want to protect your teeth. That being said it probably isn't enough acidity to affect your stomach enough to cause acid reflex. However you are drinking very dilute amounts of lemon juice which probably makes the effects negligible. I can't find any research to support this (there isn't much on this topic) but unless you are also drinking something very acidic on top of the lemon water I'm sure you will be fine. Just to keep an eye out you should look for signs of tooth decay,   is a good place to check for signs/symptoms. However ignore the advice that "all carbonated drinks" harm your enamel. This is simply not true since not all carbonated drinks contain high amounts of acidic compounds. However, this is true of all soft drinks (aka a "soda"). To ease your mind, lemon juice with mineral water is a traditional drink in Italy and across most of Europe. I personally have grown up drinking it, along with all of my relatives, and have never experienced any enamel weakening. In fact my dentist regularly comments that I have incredibly strong teeth. Still this simple breakdown of highly acidic beverages may help you avoid damaging your enamel too much, if you are worried of such things( ).	2016-03-30 15:11:53Z	FrankyG	2

Usually that mutation will do nothing sinister, but every one has the potential to develop into cancer. Mutations aside, lots of nasty things happen   when you smoke. The filter doesn't catch much of the filth, which very rapidly enters your bloodstream. The body does many things to deal with toxins, and has an emergency last resort technique for dealing with scenarios where a large volume of toxins enters the system in one go, and can't be removed fast enough. The toxins are locked up in fat cells around the liver, to effectively take them out of circulation. If you lead a very healthy lifestyle, and maintain an ideal weight, then over time, those stored toxins will be released gradually and disposed of via natural detoxification processes. If you don't have a calorie deficit though, then your body never needs to empty its fat reserves, so that toxic fit just stays around your liver indefinitely. All that said, I doubt that 20 cigarettes every few months will do noticeable harm, except for making you stink. Stress can cause harm, if not physically then certainly mentally. Perhaps a bigger risk though is the thought habit you are developing of justifying smoking by blaming stress. As an ex-smoker, I know this cycle too well. There is a risk that you might gradually increase the frequency of smoking, each time blaming stressful situations. Perhaps instead of wondering how much harm your smoking is doing, perhaps it would be better to tackle the underlying stress, or find an alternative stress relief.	2016-03-27 17:01:41Z	YviDe	1

The surgeon typically removes the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue to ensure complete removal( ). In reality any tumor could be potentially operable if we had perfect hands, but a tumor is deemed inoperable when the surgeon himself does not feel safe attempting to excise it( ). Typically survival rates from cancers depend on the stage they were caught in ( ). Early cancers can usually be successfully treated with chemo and/or surgery, although it should be noted even if surgery is successful it is generally used along with chemo regardless just as an extra precaution( ). In all honestly it is difficult to answer your question with percentages or raw numbers. It depends wildly on the type of cancer, tumor progression, location of the tumor, and unfortunately the skill of the surgeon himself/herself. Further complicating those numbers is the fact that not all surgeries are intended for complete removal. Sometimes you may want a diagnostic sample or to perform a palliative surgery, in which you remove enough of the tumor to relieve symptoms for a patient that is usually beyond any other means of help( ). More than likely you'll find much more reliable numbers in the other types of cancer therapies, most specifically in targeted biological/genetic approaches which are becoming more and more prevalent. Many of these are hopeful but for now far from human clinical trials ( , ). A brand new finding, that is in clinicals from what I understand, is called SR2943 which targets the famed "Warburg Effect" of cancer cells. However even this has variable effects depending on the type of cancers since they do not all use this effect to the same degree, maybe some do not use it at all( ). There is even some evidence to suggest cancer cells use amino acids at an abnormal rate and perhaps we should do something similar, that SR2943 does to limit lipogensis, but specifically for amino acids( ).

5202	5219	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5219	Good question(s). I can't answer all of it by I'll try to en light. Your body obviously needs vitamins, minerals, proteins etc. 
First of all, it needs those in different quantities at different times. Example, need more water if its hot and your exercising. You need more folic acid when you are pregnant (because the new forming child needs it for DNA synthesis).  Secondly, some of those can be stored very in large quantities and for a long period, while others can't. Example, if you have a normal diet your body has a storage of vitamine B12 to last 2 years. As you pointed out, you only last a few days without water intake.  Thirdly, your body can synthesize some nutrients by itself. Vitamine D3 is produced in the skin from cholesterol using UV light. Some aminoacids are synthesized by your body (non-essential amino acids), while others need to be supplied by diet (essential amino acids). Then another factor of the DRI is how well your body can absorb those nutrients. Example, iron absorption from meat is much better than iron absorption from vegetables. However, water is absorbed for almost 90%. Also important: There is a huge difference in how well your body can tollerate shortage (deficiency) or overdosis (intoxication) of different nutrients. Example, you can handle enormous amounts of vitamine C, glucose (sugar), fats, proteins and more. However, it can't handle large quantities of iron or tablesalt (actually, the body can regulate its salt levels very well, but eat 6 tablespoons of salt and you need medical care) can be very bad for health. And last but not least, most of those factors are very different per individual. So there are numerous factors (and i hardly described them all) that play a role in how much nutrients you can and should take in. Your questions: As said, that depends on which nutrient. Some you can skip for months (years!) and some you don't.  Your body can store vitamine A very well. I can't tell how much days you can "skip". The DRI are "avarage intake" over a period.  This can't be answered. You would need to know for every (which is unknown) nutrient you need:
- how much you as a person need, which differs per individual
- how much of every nutrient is in all foodstuff (which is unknown and differs per appel/tomato/carrot etc)
- how well your individual body absorbs those nutrients
and then calculate it for every nutrient, which are very much. I'm not a health professional nor diet guru. But my advise: do not worry to much. Wanting to know what you need to eat and what is healthy is a very good custom. But I think you want to calculate everything and that is unhealthy, since it will take you too much time and stress.  Your national dietary guidelines are based on the latest knowledge and research. Try to keep up with them and you will be safe. And have a varied diet! Always eating tomatoes and carrots is not necessarily healthy, as you could miss some less well known proteins and minerals.  Sources:

5179	14479	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14479	Alas, you cannot protect yourself from these toxic substances once they are in your body. Further, as currently phrased this question is awfully broad. We have managed to produce a gigantic amount of different harmful substances and covering them all in this answer is really not possible. Instead this answer tries to generalise about fat-soluble and long term stable materials that get liberated in weight loss. Any substance mentioned in citations is meant as one example, most examples do not generate generally applicable advice. There are some options to consider to protect you from the harm these substances do. For obvious ethical reasons most of the following is based on experimental data   and not nearly enough on human trials. The good news is, these substances are generally very stable, but not indestructible. They do accumulate in fatty tissues and are hardly excreted or broken down. But eventually some of them are broken down or just excreted. The dynamics of POP release and damage are still investigated and indeed worrisome: To minimise the damage they will do there are a few routes open, all of them weak and some of them based on preliminary results and reasonable speculation: Although it was already priced into the original question, the slower the weight loss the slower the release of persisten organic pollutants (POPs). The dosage makes the poison and therfore slowing the release of these unwanted materials is all the better.   As should be obvious highly lipophilic substances like those in question are not easily deposed of. But the body does eliminate them, very slowly, once they are mobilised from the fatty tissues. That means drinking a lot helps, sweating a lot helps and loosing blood helps. Speeding up the metabolism, exercising or even going to a sauna seem quite beneficial.  The loosing blood needs special mention since it would be unethical to go donating blood if anyone does it to get rid of toxic substances. Yet it seems strange to advise blood-letting again, even when this involves a round of the venerable   treatment. But once the substances are mobilised they are transported via blood to areas you want to to avoid them ending up. Extracting this contaminated blood is not the strangest of ideas then. Finally, the infamous   and its kind may have a role of value: There were a few theories proposed for certain mechanisms of action for these substances, one of them being endocrinal disrupters another being promoter of oxidative stress. Especially the latter has received some attention and the old adage of food being your medicine came to life again. While "eat healthy" seems like a no-brainer on this front it is currently the best practical advice available. These findings are very limited by their nature. Popular "anti-oxidants" have usually a very low bioavailability and even in those experimental settings used to study them in regard to POPs with scaffolding mechanisms their effectiveness was greater than zero, but still not very great. Curcumin, resveratrol, CoQ10, NAC and just about all of the usual suspects for such a scenario showed some promise. The best treatment is of course preventing any new harmful material from entering your system. For that it might be worth considering decrease animal fat consumption:	2017-11-26 19:47:27Z	LangLangC	2

5175	5176	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5176	Ah, but they can and do. A non-rebreather (NRB) mask with 100% O2 flowing at 12-15 L/min will provide about 90% O2 concentration to an adult. This is true even for the largest adult in severe respiratory distress. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, the 3 liters figure you cited is the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV). Here are two definitions you need to consider: Average capacities are 500 mL for VT and 3000 mL for IRV. Note that the IRV is the volume of air that can be   inhaled. It's not something anyone normally does except during extreme exertion (eg, athletics) or when directed in a breathing test. So the 3 liters you cite isn't the amount of air someone normally inhales; the TV of 500 mL is much more typical, meaning the bag provides two full breaths of reserve and the flow of 12-15 L/min O2 completely refills that bag every 3-4 seconds. So a 1 mL reservoir bag being fed by O2 flowing at 15 mL/min is in fact more than adequate to supply 90% O2 concentrations to even a large adult in extreme respiratory distress. It can and will raise their SpO2 significantly in a short period of time if their cardio-pulmonary system is capable of absorbing and delivering it (which may not be the case if they're in need of such measures, but that's another issue).  Note that a NRB only works with a patient who is breathing adequately on their own. If a patient isn't breathing, or isn't breathing adequately, the next step up is a  . A BVM allows a medical provider to mechanically breath for the patient. The tubing you see coiled up next to the reservoir would be attached to an O2 source delivering 100% O2 at 12-15 L/min and then the provider would squeeze the bag at a normal breathing rate, forcing O2 into the patient's lungs. With this device O2 can be forced into the lungs of a non-breathing patient, or assisted into the lungs of a patient too sick or too weak to breath normally on their own. Generally, once a BVM has been employed the next step will be  .  As the diagram shows, a plastic tube is inserted into the patient's trachea and then a BVM or mechanical respirator is attached to the other end. A source of O2 is also attached. Once intubated, 100% O2 can be supplied to the patient at any volume desired. And once a mechanical ventilator is attached, much finer control of O2 concentration, volume, and other parameters are possible.  Not shown in the diagram is the small balloon on the tube at the end inserted into the trachea. Once the tube is in place, that balloon is inflated, which holds the tube in place and completely seals the trachea from anything entering or leaving except via the tube. In this way, the patient is also protected by the tube from aspirating vomit, blood, broken teeth, or whatever else might be present in the throat.  The OP stated in the comments that he can deflate the reservoir by donning a NRB with a 25 L/min flow of air and then doing strenuous exercises. Specifically: Two things explain this. First, he's a healthy person able to do vigorous exercises and then inhale fully to his full lung capacity. Sick people who need supplemental O2 rarely fit that description. In many cases they literally cannot fully fill their lungs with a breath no matter how hard they try, and they are often in distress, which leads to very rapid, shallow respirations.  Second, he was breathing plain air, which is 21% O2. A patient on a NRB will be breathing supplemental O2 at a concentration of about 90%. In other words, every breath the OP took contained 1/5th as much oxygen as the breaths a patient would be taking. I think that if the OP repeated his experiment using 100% O2 instead of plain air, he would get very different results and wouldn't find himself struggling to get enough air.	2016-03-19 00:29:52Z	Carey Gregory	7

I'm new here, i thought I keep it simple. I will try to provide some evidence and complete the answer: HSV-1 infects mucosal cells, like the ones in mouth and genitalia. After infection the HSV virus infects innervating neurons causing a latent infection. While the mucosal cells are infected, CD8+ cells (which kill virus infected cells) "learn" to recognize the virus and kill it of. As long as your CD8+ cells function normally the virus cannot reactivate. Also antibodies agains the infecting virus are formed, protecting against reinfection (theoretically you could also reinfect yourself)  (1)  As @YviDe pointed out it is possible to get infected with multiple strains. In this a small study with 13 HSV-1 infect persons 2 where infected with more than 1 strain (2) However, there is also evidence an infection with HSV can protect against an infection with another strain. (3)  Now, lets assume you and your wife have the same strain of virus. Then the likelihood of you reinfecting yourself is much higher than she infecting you, since you drink from your infected glass and use your infected toothbrush etc.  If she has a different strain things are uncertain. As pointed out, your current infection could protect you but depending on numerous factors you can get reinfected or not with the different strain. If you have a cold sore your immune system (partly) compromised, so at that moment your susceptibility for a infection by this different strain is probably higher. 
However, changes that you get infected anyway while living under the same roof is pretty high. If I where you, I would worry about it to much since you can't be sure about anything without genetic sequencing of your and your wifes HSV-1 virus.

It is uncommon to use craft type activities outside of mental health and paediatrics unless it holds some specific meaning for the individual undergoing treatment. In assessing an individual who has undergone cardiac surgery and is looking to regain independence, I would observe/assist them with a regular activity, such as getting dressed or preparing a hot drink depending on their current level of function. I would specifically be looking at standing and exercise tolerance, functional mobility within the area, balance, and fine motor function. Observing the activity would allow me to ensure other functions were intact - for example, those related to cognition. Once I understood their present physical presentation, I would prepare a treatment plan that enabled me to work on the skills required to develop their independence.  The key thing, for me as a therapist, is to ensure that the treatment activities I am preparing are meaningful to the individual, and that they address the areas identified within my assessment. Every treatment session is also an assessment so that treatment is fluid and adapts as the needs of the individual change. If your father's current treatment is not meaningful and is not helping him to progress, I would certainly speak to his therapist in order to understand why they believe the activities are beneficial and what the goals of the intervention are.

Although the impact of the mint would seem minimal, the abnormal result itself deserves repeating. Unfortunately, insulin resistance has become a huge problem and I see it all the time in clinical practice and am no longer surprised when a fit appearing person or an athlete I work with has abnormal glucose metabolism. Another test(s) to consider would be a fasting insulin and a 2 hour glucose tolerance test. An A1C can be useful combined with other tests. The approach to figuring out your actual question - Am I pre-diabetic? hinges on the viewpoint of the treating physician. From a functional medicine approach, normal is often pathologic.  For example, using a normal A1C to exclude insulin resistance and prediabetes will miss a large number of people already in trouble.  Glucose tolerance testing is considered gold standard by many functional medicine experts. A 2-hour reading of 120-139 indicated >60% loss of pancreas Beta cell function (decreased insulin production). A 1-hour 120 or above indicates insulin resistance.  Lipids are also important in determining the risk and using a ratio of triglycerides to HDL (good cholesterol) can help identify insulin resistance. reference: 4th International Congress on Prediabetes and Metabolic Syndrome.

In the US, the FDA specifically approves splitting of pills only when the manufacturer plans for it by including it in their drug approval application. By including it in their application the FDA will require the manufacturer to submit evidence that splitting the pills results in equal dosages and equal effectiveness. Without that evidence, you as a consumer have no way of being sure how it will behave. Maybe it will be okay and maybe it won't.  : It's pretty far fetched to think that manufacturers are going to increase profits by telling consumers their pills shouldn't be split. The percentage of patients that would even apply to would be small since doctors don't make a practice of prescribing stronger strengths than patients actually need. Also, pill dosages are sized to meet the majority of patients' needs so any increased profits they actually realized would be trivial and probably not worth the risk of the bad PR that would result from being discovered.	2016-03-15 22:19:47Z	Carey Gregory	4

Second, the language WebMD uses is very important here. They state that it is "  99.9% effective" when " ." Well, that's quite a bit like the gas mileage numbers automobile manufacturers state for their cars.

Sweating is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, as is vasodilation (facial redness). Anhydrosis of only one side of the face would be due dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve (which also carries sensory and motor components) on that side of the face. The trigeminal nerve can lose function for many reasons, but rarely does it lose only   of it's functions (i.e. the physical exam should help here.)  Ross syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by segmental an-/hypohydrosis, pupil irregularity (called Adie's pupil), and diminished deep tendon reflexes. Harlequin syndrome is another possibility. Horner's syndrome is the broad term for the decreased sympathetic nerve function, and, again, involves more than anhydrosis. It is characterized by the triad of miosis (constricted pupil), partial ptosis, and loss of hemifacial sweating. Horner's is not rare per se, and can occur alone or with a number of illnesses. Serious disorders should be ruled out, e.g. internal carotid artery dissection (not always symptomatic), malignancies anywhere from central nervous system/trigeminal/apical lung/etc., other causes of carotid ischemia, etc. Since the differential of Horner's Syndrome is large and it is a neurological problem, a neurologist is probably the best bet for a diagnosis here.

For protein, bioavailability is also called  . The BV of an egg, for example is   (see column 5). For cooked chicken,  .  It's hard to find sources for protein powder/shakes that don't seem biased (being from the manufactors of the protein, or bodybuilding sites), but here's a study from the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine:  . It uses an adjusted scale, where a whole egg has a biological value of 100. In that scale, since whey protein has a higher BV than whole egg, it comes out as 104. Soy protein and casein have BVs in the mid-70s, a bit lower than beef. As for whether they have the same effect, well, what's different betrween different sources of protein is  . Proteins are made from building blocks called amino acids, of which there are 20 in food. Many of those can be converted from one to the other or made from other things we eat, but   and have to be eaten. Different foods, including protein powders differ in what amino acids they have. Usually, protein powders will contain these. How much they contain will depend on the product.  Keep in mind that no source of is 'perfect' in that regard, either. A bean does not have the same amino acid composition in its proteins as a human body does. Neither does whey protein. Deficiency in essential amino acids isn't pleasant,  . Basically, a lot of the same applies for vitamins. They aren't perfectly bioavailable when digested from food   from a multivitamin, sometimes one is better, sometimes the other. Answering this for all vitamins is way too broad, and it probably also depends on the product. The paper   goes into a few of the problems and general concepts.  For example, it looks like the bioavailibility of folic acid taken up from dietery supplements  , and especially outperforms   (warning: low number of subjects in study...). For vitamin C,   summarizes: And goes on to say: So whole foods are preferable, but the vitamin C that you get from the supplements itself isn't any better or worse than the vitamin C an apple contains, and certainly isn't unhealthy.  For some people, getting all vitamins they need from their diet is either impossible or very hard (vitamin D and iron deficiencies are rather common) and that's where supplements like the protein bars you use come in.  As pointed out by Atl LED in the comments, though, for vitamin supplements to work it's important to take care of how the multivitamins need to be taken. If they need to be taken with food for maximum absorption, that's important or else you won't get the full benefits.  If protein bars are judged as 'unhealthy' it should be because of things like their sugar content, but it's certainly not true that the proteins or vitamins in them are  unhealthy or that we can't use them at all.	2016-03-23 13:53:41Z	YviDe	6

You will find the best at health food stores, not general vitamin stores. Steer clear of whey as there are negative aspects of that and I along with others suspect its popularity is only due to industry trying to find a way to profit off of whey, which is left over from processed animal foods, namely greek yogurt, in such an excess that it is very hazardous to the environment. So, not only do they have to find a responsible way to get rid of all this excess whey, but they try to find ways they can simultaneously profit off of it. I personally noticed seeing a lot of whey supplements as greek yogurt became popular so I feel that's something to take into account. You want pure, preferably organic ingredients with no hidden msg or other unnatural ingredients. And you want one that is WHOLE FOODS BASED. That is very important. Raw is best. I highly recommend Garden of Life's Raw Fit as it has every essential amino acid, probiotics, antioxidants, vitamins and many minerals. 1 scoop provides 28 grams protein and 90% daily value of magnesium which the western world is extremely deficient in.  Same goes for bars... look for bars in health food stores. I would look for seed and nut bars as opposed to very processed bars with long lists of ingredients. 	2016-03-13 07:27:13Z	Lydia	-6

The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has information on both types. Research does not strongly support the effectiveness of most of these uses, with the possible exception of immune stimulation and diabetes treatment, though neither effect may be substantial. Again, American ginseng succeeds a little in the same areas as its Asian counterpart, but completely fails to improve athletic performance or treat cancer. I highly recommend going through the list of references given on each page. Most are specific, but some are good overviews, including  . Additionally, note that both MSKCC pages point out that ginseng can have many negative side effects, so use of it may be detrimental. In answer to your specific request for an exercise/musculoskeletal condition, the response is that no, ginseng has not been shown to be helpful in these respects. There is no data to show that it can boost athletic performance, as I mentioned above.

E.g. it is known that many people have undiagnosed diabetes, many people have undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Also kidney function can be impaired quite a bit (e.g. due to diabetes) without that leading to symptoms. If we focus on these issues then you could choose to the following test: Glucose and HbA1c to see if the person has diabetes, TSH and T4 to detect hypothyroidism, and creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium to detect problems with the kidneys. Also, measuring HDL and LDL cholesterol can be useful as quite a few young people have too high cholesterol levels. Now, to make the question better defined, one can ask how to choose some given number of blood tests such that some chosen health criterion, say, the survival probability after ten years is optimized. This can in principle be calculated from the known statistics. To see how to set up this calculation, consider doing just one blood test for disease X. The patient is in this case selected from a pool of people who do not have any significant symptoms of disease X. So, if X represents diabetes, the patient is currently not complaining about excessive thirsts, feeling tired etc. If X represents kidney disease then the patient is not at the stage where the kidney function is so low that it causes symptoms. This means that the probability that the patient will be found to be suffering from X should be derived from the appropriate conditional probability that conditions on the patient not having any significant symptoms (the symptoms are mild enough for it to be compatible to having no complaints). For any chosen X you can then calculate the health criterion (e.g. survival after ten years) in the event of a positive test compared to not doing the test. So, this depends on the known effects of early treatment, the probability for detecting X will then yield the expected improvement for this health outcome.	2016-03-10 05:42:00Z	Count Iblis	-1

5006	5031	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5031	Iodine is absolutely an  , and is required for proper functioning of your body. It is a component of the     (also known as T3) and its precursor form T4 (thyroxine). This hormone is involved in quite a few processes in the body, and acts on nearly every cell in it.  A deficit of iodine can cause a number of diseases, including   (swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck),   (can cause increased sensitivity to cold, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and depression),  , and   (presents as severely stunted development and growth, both physical and mental, but unlikely to affect a healthy adult). Now, iodized salt is not the only source of iodine in one's food. It can also be found in fish, shellfish, and kelp products, milk and eggs from iodine-sufficient farm animals, and plants grown on iodine-rish soil. The   of iodine varies between 150 µg per day for healthy adults to 250-290 µg/day for pregnant and lactating women, respectively. Children require somewhat lower amounts. On the other hand, the recommended upper limit is around 1100 µg (1.1 mg) per day for adults.  A quarter teaspoon (1.5g) of the iodized sea salt in my cabinet provides "45%" of the recommended daily value of iodine (the label doesn't provide mass). Assuming they're using the 150 µg value, that's 67.5 µg iodine in a serving that provides one quarter of your sodium for the day. The table in   of the Health Professional Fact Sheet for iodine from the NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements provides some values for iodine levels in various other food sources: So, bottom line, you are likely getting sufficient iodine in your daily diet, even without using iodized salt. Now, I don't want to discourage the use of it at all, as there is absolutely nothing wrong with it from a health perspective (except from overconsumption, but that applies to most everything). Not everyone (especially in America, the UK, and some other countries) eat very healthy diets, but since the use of iodized salt in restaurants and for food manufacturers is required by law, Westerners are not likely to be under-iodinated. Of course, the best way to tell is to go to your primary health care provider, explain your situation, and ask if they'd be willing to order a thyroid function blood test. It looks at the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, from the pituitary gland) along with thyroid hormone itself. However, as long as you aren't experiencing any of the symptoms of hypothyroidism and don't have a goiter, you're probably OK.	2016-03-05 04:07:58Z	MattDMo	8

Weak blood types can be caused by a person having a mutation that leads to not expressing the type A or B antibodies as much, or by mutations in the genes coding for these that mean the antibodies they do produce react less when brought into contact with type A and B antigens for testing.  Weak type A and B are different, and there are also  . For example, here is a case study of a patient with weak type A blood (much of the research is on that, as it is more common than weak type B):  Basically, weak type A or B blood donors's blood may be mistyped as being type O. If it is given to recipients with blood type O, these patients may experience blood agglutination which can be dangerous.  This does not concern your case, as it is about weak type A, but I'm including this for completeness sake: One of the weak type A groups, A  is special, in that people with this blood type should not donate for people with type A blood, as they actually have antibodies against the dominant type A antigen.  None of the sources I could find went into much detail what this meant for receiving blood transfusions. None mentioned not being able to receive type A or B blood if the patient is a weak type A or B.  Being mistyped as O when receiving blood is not going to lead to any major problems - however, it means the person will only receive type O blood and not type A or B blood. In situations with a donor blood shortage this might be a disadvantage.  The researchers of the study told the donors, so they would know that their blood could not be given to a type O patient.  You might want to give your child something similar to carry around with them. Maybe the doctor/lab that identified the weak blood type has something suiting. 	2016-03-01 09:02:13Z	YviDe	4

If we assuming that there is no medical problem, then this means that you need to eat a lot more during the day. The best way to do that is to eat more at dinner, more during lunch and if needed eat another full lunch a few hours later. If you start to eat a meal just before sleeping that you are not at present eating, that may interfere with sleep; instead of waking up from hunger, you may wake up more frequently to go to the toilet. My own routine to deal with having to eat a lot is as follows. I eat breakfast twice, when I wake up and two hours later. I eat lunch a few hour later. I'll eat lunch a second time 3 hours later. At dinner time I will eat a very large meal of around 1700 Kcal. Before I go to bed I'll eat a small meal. The total energy intake is around 3700 Kcal, this allows me to do my daily one hour of running while still having plenty of energy and not feeling hungry all the time.

It takes a bit longer to digest, so the body and stomach don't feel the need to eat often. Avoid this though if you're hypoglycemic or diabetic, or have circulatory issues. Eating and sleeping before an hour of sleep is usually not a good idea if you have any of the above illnesses.  The reason I say that is because it can cause early onset of stomach ulcers, and gastroperesis which basically means your stomach does not release its contents into the upper intestine quick enough. Your stomach stays full of food and stomach acid. It will make you feel icky. Avoid heavily acidic food as well. Chili's, tomatoes, dairy. Nine hours is also a very long time for the stomach to be full. If you have the right diet, you can eventually get rid of that feeling. That aside, bread is also something that can curve appetite. You could try a chicken sandwich. Lean cut beef sandwich. Black bean soup. You should be able to Google more high protein meals.  That basically sums it up ^	2016-02-29 22:05:57Z	cloudnyn3	0

Some paresthsias are familiar to all of us: a foot falling asleep after crossing our legs too long, or the tingling of a spot on the lip before a cold sore breaks out. However, paresthesias can result from some minor pressure or disruption of a single sensory nerve, and they can last from hours to days, they can come and go, and they can be very irritating.   Paresthesias may be present in a wide variety of conditions ranging from vitamin deficiencies to serious illnesses like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, etc. These tend to be caused by nerve damage. Hypocalcemia, hyperventilation, migraines, inflammation, and a wide variety of other "insults" can cause paresthesias as well. Many people experience the kind of paresthesias you describe (albeit in different places), and an etiology will not be found. Often they are benign. However, when in doubt, ask your doctor. The specialist who probably most commonly deals with paresthesias is a neurologist.

For instance, one of the greatest Brazilian female singers, Clara Nunes died some 30 years ago in one such operation, at the peak of her energy. Some people say this is old news, so here are more recent ones: I should mention that probably the biggest risk lies with the anesthesia. Several other news relate people dying because of the anesthesia in other common surgeries, some of them purely aesthetic (like liposuction).   is shocking:  bring numbers way higher than seven in a million: That's 1 death in 500 anesthetics. I'd prefer to keep my varicose veins, at least until I know the numbers about the risk they represent.

Other or later symptoms include muscle pain, dry cough, severe fatigue or nausea.

4925	4930	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4930	First, let's define retrograde amnesia carefully. You'll find many sources listing drugs that cause retrograde amnesia but they're using the term incorrectly. From  : With that definition in mind, I don't think drugs exist that cause retrograde amnesia for the past few days, much less years. Some drugs will create retrograde amnesia for memories formed minutes before administration, but not much longer than that. This is believed to be because they interfere with the memory formation process, which is still incomplete when the drug is taken. Long term alcohol abuse can cause retrograde amnesia, but that's due to the brain damage it causes after long-term abuse. No single binge, even a long one, will cause retrograde amnesia if the abuse is short-lived. There are   that have produced retrograde amnesia by administering agents directly to the brain, but that's not something a doctor can give you. They may lead to such drugs in the future, but they're not available yet. There are   that can prevent new memories from being formed such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and anesthesia agents such as propofol, but they all work by preventing  . They don't wipe out memories formed before the drug was taken and therefore can't be said to cause retrograde amnesia. So, basically, true retrograde amnesia is usually due to brain damage from agents such as dementia, trauma, stroke, infection, prolonged seizures, and long-term substance abuse. There are no drugs a doctor can give you that will accomplish this.	2016-02-24 00:27:23Z	Carey Gregory	4
4924	4926	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4926	Using any medication, including ibuprofen, in doses higher than recommended,  is very unwise. There is a reason that patient information leaflets exist, and that health professionals insist that the patients read and understand these leaflets (and ask questions when necessary) prior to consumption. First of all, ibuprofen is a non-steroid anti-inflamatory drug (NSAID). If the cause of your toothache is tooth decay (cavities) it will treat the pain, i.e the symptom, but not the underlying cause of your toothache. There might be another reason for your toothache, but nonetheless:  Recommended daily dose of ibuprofen for an adult is 1.2g to 1.8g   which means that you could take up to 1800 mg during a day - that is during a 24 hour period, but definitely not all at once. And yes, taking them 30 minutes apart is pretty much the same as at once, given ibuprofen's kinetics. These recommendations are based on an average adult, with a healthy liver and kidneys.  Sometimes this dose may be increased up to 2.4g (UK) or even 3.2g (USA) and this would be the  . (Martindale) However, this is not a common practice for a toothache.  There are side effects associated with the use of ibuprofen, and many of them are dose-dependent.  From NHS: Common side effects include: Some less common: In high doses there are additional risks, such as those for the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels): (from: European Medicines Agency). Ibuprofen might interact with and increase the toxicity of some other concomitantly used medication, such as: aspirin, ciclosporin, fluconasole, voriconasole, colestiramine, mifepristone, tacrolimus, methotrexate, lithium, zidovudine, warfarin, ciprofibrate, baclofen... If you are taking any other medication with ibuprofen, the best course of action is to consult with a healthcare professional first. Finally, although ibuprofen is an OTC, higher potency preparations, such as those of 600mg per dose are actually prescription only in many countries. A side note: I don't even know how to comment on your: "let's take a lot of this medication and see what happens" approach. Medicines are not candy. If you behave so recklessly about your own health, who else is supposed to take care of it for you?

4919	4931	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4931	You are correct that this happens. It is infrequent (there are not "many", as you say, compared to true deaths), but it occasionally happens that someone - even in a hospital - is thought to be dead when they are not actually dead. In one of your stories, the girl was presumed to be  , not dead. So strike that one. Hypothermia is a beast all unto itself, and declaring a cold person dead is a bit tricky.* Determining death is not simple. The International Guidelines for the Determination of Death – Phase I (May 30-31, 2012) Montreal Forum Report is 46 pages long and it still doesn't have a definitive conclusion. For the most part (and to simplify a bit), death is determined to have occurred when someone is exceedingly unlikely (determined from experience of millions of deaths) to regain function of their heart. It can be from a very wide variety of causes, but basically it follows cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest. The procedure is to observe the patient carefully. In hospital, that usually includes electronic monitors of one sort or another. Out of hospital it's by observation. When there is no evidence of cardiac electrical activity capable of generating a pulse, the patient has not been breathing for some time, oxygenation of blood has fallen to beyond critical levels, and there is no neurological activity, they are pronounced dead.** They "know" because of the combined observations of millions of deaths before that one. Since it has happened, clearly it   happen, but once all the criteria are met, it means they are clinically dead. The exceedingly vast majority of people observed to be clinically dead are, indeed, dead (no possibility to regain function.) There's nothing else to do. It is roughly estimated from the   that about 56 million people die every year. Yet it is not every day that someone who was thought to be dead is not, or it wouldn't make the news. Lets be   generous and say it happens once a month somewhere in the world - 12 times a year - and I think this is very, very generous (there is no known number. I'm guessing it's less in industrialized nations.)  That would mean a death diagnostic accuracy rate of at least 99.9999786% (55,999,988 true deaths in 56,000,000 diagnosed deaths.) That is very, very accurate. It is incredibly difficult and expensive to improve on 99.9999786% of anything for a very small return numerically speaking. It sounds harsh, but it's not. It's what society accepts, including you. If you don't believe me, try to get someone to pass a law changing that. A better question might be   It happens because sometimes a heartbeat is so weak as to be imperceptible to the touch, to sound, and even electronically. The person does not appear to be breathing  . They have no reflexes to demonstrate neuronal activity (for example, the pupil size doesn't change on shining a light into their eyes.) In the days before burial, that doesn't change 99.9999786% of the time. But if someone's metabolic rate is low enough, they might just survive (being cold increases the chances of this*) and the heart might just start getting stronger and they might just wake up. But the odds of that are so extraordinarily low that the increased expense of storing the body, and checking it again in a more advanced state of decomposition, in addition to the increased risk of contagion... it just doesn't happen, because when someone is declared dead, they are dead 99.9999+% of the time.   The whole situation is frightening to some people. But it's really an irrational fear. To put the "risk" in more understandable terms - because the difference between life and death are pretty important - in 2013 in the US, there were 16,121 homicides. About 20% of those are stranger on stranger homicides (that is, not domestic violence, gang related, etc.). That means of 316,000,000 people in the US that year, about 3,225 people were killed by someone unknown to them, or one in 97,984. That's much higher than 12 in 56 million (which is roughly one in 4,670,000). Yet, though it's more common, you probably still leave your house most days not worrying that you'll be killed in that year. It's an acceptable risk, though death by firearm at a stranger's hand is never acceptable. If this is an unacceptable risk to you (I'm not being sarcastic; it is an acceptable risk for me personally), you should stipulate in your will your wishes to be kept in storage and reexamined intermittently over a period of several days longer than usual for signs of life, and include the funds to do this. * **

Do not bear any weight until you can see a specialist and get a diagnosis, and a diagnosis you are happy with. Try to rest it as much as possible and keep the limb elevated above the heart as much as you can until you have professional medical advice. In my situation: I saw the orthopaedic specialist today. The conclusion from the x ray is that yes, it's fractured... But the "good" news is that I only have a fracture boot and can load bear on my heel as much as pain allows. The summary is that there's a lateral metatarsal ligament that binds the knuckles of the metatarsals together, and as long as only 1 of the central metatarsals is fractured, it is in effect supported in position by that ligament and the two either side act as splints. In that the bone is in the correct position, it'll not drop back (if more than one was fractured, the ligament would pull it back) and it'll be 3 -4 weeks before I can start to weight bear and 6 weeks should be back to   normal.

There are, however, various therapeutic options for patients suffering from MS. Some of them include chemotherapeutics - but not as the first-line treatment. The important thing to understand is that there are many forms of MS, which can roughly be categorised in four groups: Severity, clinical manifestations and treatment options differ across these types. The most common type is RR.  For RR there are two sorts of treatment: It is the second group, where chemotherapy can be used, but, as mentioned above not as a first-line treatment. This means that other therapeutic options should be tried first. These are predominantly glatiramer acetate or interferon beta. If they don't work some other medicines are considered. Only if they don't work either, the next option is using chemotherapeutic agents. There are, again two approaches. The first one is to use these medicines, at lower doses than to treat cancer, to suppress the immune system. Since MS is an autoimmune disease, immune suppression reduces the inflammation and damage to the myelin sheet. Another approach is to use these medicines to ablate the immune system prior to autologous stem cell transplant, where the patient's bone marrow is replaced with their stem cells. This line of treatment is, however, still in experimental phase and has not been approved. There are many complications, difficulties and side-effects of this procedure, and thus far the risks outweigh the benefits.

 Notice how  . The diameter of the arch (half-circle) is reduced throughout life, and therefore the teeth are forced to get crowded to fit in the reduced space. This can even happen to older people who did not get an orthodontic treatment! The top retainer is there to prevent the top teeth from moving back into their original location. Therefore the fact that you wear the top retainer makes absolutely no difference for the bottom teeth. The second aspect of the question is concerning the health of the gums and periodontal tissues. If you are unable to perform dental hygiene routinely, you should speak to your Orthodontist, and make it known that it is a problem for you.

A smartphone has a gyroscope built in, and when you lay it on the mattress close to your body, it picks up tiny movements. As you fall asleep, your musculature relaxes, and the app knows how to distinguish the movements of a person in deep sleep, light sleep, and lying awake. It provides you with a record of your sleep cycles for the night.  It is probably not perfectly accurate, but I find it quite good from personal experience. It certainly can distinguish between times when I lay awake, trying to fall asleep (and not noticeably moving) and times when I am really asleep. I can't say how good it is for hypnogogic states, and it can be fooled somewhat if you are concentrating on not moving while awake (e.g. if you are doing a muscle relaxation exercise or meditating). But for normal sleep, it gives you a nice record.  I have no peer reviewed sources on this, so will have to give you a commercial link:   is the app I use, but AFAIK there are several per platform.

The theory is that since it transports fatty acids to be broken down, more carnitine will transport more, thus driving increased fat utilization/breakdown. L-Carnitine is a  , from the amino acids lysine and methionine by the kidneys and the liver. It can also be consumed, and it is mostly stored in tissues such as skeletal and cardiac muscle. It plays a role in delivering long chain fatty acids to mitochondria for energy metabolism, as well as transporting out waste products. The body excretes excess carnitine to maintain stable blood levels, so unless you are deficient (Or have a condition where your body does not independently produce it), you are unlikely to benefit from extra carnitine consumption. I was able to find two different studies regarding the effect on weight loss.   was performed using obese rats fed a low calorie (hypocaloric) diet.

4767	4768	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4768	The short answer is no, your metabolism isn't really driven by your heart rate.  The   is that it is the process by which your body converts the food and liquid that you consume into energy to fuel the body. This can be generally divided into two components,  , which is the breaking down of ingested items into energy, and  , which is the building up of cells with proteins and nucleic acids. The link I provided gives a basic definition and a basic writeup relating metabolism to weight loss. The heart has a role in this, in that it delivers oxygen to the body which is used in metabolic processes, but part of   is that the cardiovascular system gets more efficient at delivering oxygen where and when needed. This is (in part) why your heart rate slows as you get fit. These adaptations include neovascularization (more capillaries/blood vessels grow into working muscles), stronger pumping action, and ventricular enlargement so the heart can pump more blood per beat. Oxygen delivery remains stable and adapts to deliver what is needed according to activity. Your most likely culprit for the weight gain is that you are exchanging muscle for fat. Muscle is denser and weighs more than fat does, so if you lose a proportion of fat and replace it with an equal proportion of muscle, you will weigh more at the end of that process.	2016-02-10 15:56:25Z	JohnP	5

The most intensive studies are being carried out in animal models, and their applicability to humans is not yet guaranteed. Can a person change their microbiome with probiotics? Researchers are still dubious. There is a lot of research that indicates that the intestinal flora you carry throughout your life is largely determined in early infancy.

The two areas of greatest study in humans is   (associated with certain strains of gut bacteria in certain populations) and as a treatment for Clostridium Difficile colitis, and none of the findings can be generalized yet to the "normal" population. Inflammatory Bowel Disease had been studied as well, and some other disorders, to a lesser extent. But how to change our microbiomes is far from a known fact. However, what scientists who study the gut microbiome do agree on is that  . Most specialists do not recommend, for example, eating yogurt as an effective way to ingest probiotics. Most yogurts (including those with live cultures) don't have enough CFU's/serving to make a difference, and don't have a diversity of active cultures. By a healthy diet, they mean a diet rich in plant-based foods, low in processed foods, and (using the average Western diet as a basis) decreased amounts of red meat, high-fat food, and sugars. In other words, a probiotic is not proven or even likely to help you, whereas a healthier diet is.  Of course, you should seek the opinion of a doctor for your digestion problem. In the meantime, a food/symptom diary is a good idea. There may be a food allergy or sensitivity at the root of your problem, and a food/symptom diary could help determine that.

Sinus rhythm ( ) is normal, meaning that the heart is depolarized by a wave starting in the sinus node. That is the first part of the message. It is worth noting, that if your heart rate had been 1 beat per minute less, it would have probably said "sinus bradycardia" as a normal heart rate is considered to be 60-100 beats per minute (BPM). Bradycardia is a heart rate below the 60 bpm threshold (50 bpm in some sources) and tachycardia would be a heart rate above 100 (90 in some sources). The "otherwise normal" is boilerplate by the machine. As you can see by   for the NASAN Simul-G ECG machine, "Otherwise normal ECG" is one of the display options. Speaking as a programmer, it's a little bit of a shortcut, so that if there is a rhythm problem but everything else is good, they can simply put "  otherwise normal ECG". Better programming would be to omit the "otherwise" when the sinus rhythm is normal. Now, realize that the machine is simply applying preformatted parameters, and that when it says normal, it just means that your readings fit into what it has defined as normal. It is possible that there is some small thing that doesn't look out of place to the machine but would to a trained cardiologist.

People can and do become habituated to vertigo-inducing motion, but it takes a long time. Similarly, the   benefit you might gain from any exercises you do (they would be similar to those one does when experiencing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) would take weeks to acquire. There is nothing you can do in this short time span to naturally decrease the probability of having a recurrence. Your best hope is in getting a good drug to prevent it. Astronauts often experience motion sickness, and the reference I used is from space aviation literature (it is available in full online but as a PDF), and is a pretty thorough treatment of the condition. There are a few things which (in addition to drugs) might help: Scopolamine is one of the most effective anti-motion sickness drugs available. Note that a transdermal scopolamine patch doesn't hit it's peak effect until 6-8 hours after it's been applied. Scopolamine isn't for everyone. Ask a pharmacist for drug information if it's available without a prescription where you are. If you opt for an antihistamine, dimenhydrinate, cyclizine, meclozine, and promethazine are the antihistamines most widely used for prophylaxis and treatment of motion sickness. Since you already tried the dimenhydrinate, you might try a different one. Please note, however, that they should be taken long before the voyage starts to be effective. This might be why yours didn't seem to last. One usually needs to build up to something a bit closer to a steady state. Cinnarizine is very popular in Europe but it is not available in the United States. A very small study found ginger (a natural anti-emetic) helpful, but this has been disputed. This is a presentation of some of the available literature. You need to discuss your specifics (age, medical conditions, etc.) with a doctor or pharmacist. Good luck.

4715	4760	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4760	I'm going to approach this from a strictly physiological stance.  With all of these diets available it can be very confusing.  Ketogenic, Atkins, Paleo, etc..  The body uses glucose for energy.  Many, many, many compounds we eat are complex and large.  Our body utilizes each of these in a very efficient manner.  Short Answer: YES!  We have a "starvation" mode, but it's called gluconeogenesis. When we stop eating, we use glycogen (huge chains of linked glucose) for energy.  When glycogen is depleted we begin to indiscriminately (situationally) using proteins and lipids for energy.  There are many molecules that contain the secret ingredient (carbon) that can be manipulated by enzymes to create the ever-important six-ringed molecule we need to live.   To be honest 1000-1500 is not really starving; depending on sex, activity level, BMR, etc.  Depending on the makeup of those 1500 calories, the body will utilize the path of least resistance.  If you take in ~600 calories from carbohydrates, you will use them.  If you take in 100 calories from carbohydrates, you will use those and glycogen supplementation.  There are signaling pathways in the body that are purposefully designed to ensure a constant, steady supply of glucose in our bloodstream.  Our brain alone uses about ~120g of carbohydrate per day.  As long as we have carbon molecules available, our body will take them and rearrange them to make "fuel".  That's why you see people lose weight or muscle mass -- because the body will literally eat muscle tissue to survive.  	2016-02-09 20:30:23Z	MG_MD	2

In short, yes, starvation mode exists, but it will not cause a person to gain weight, at least while being starved. However, once a person who has triggered their starvation reflex is allowed to eat normally and at will, they lose their sense of being satiated and not only gain their original weight back but put on much more. It takes several days of starvation (not just one or two) to trigger starvation mode. On average, people in the Minnesota study saw an average drop of metabolic rate of about 40%. This is why starvation diets are generally not recommended.	2016-04-10 06:19:28Z	BillDOe	1

One of the reasons the bacteria that infect us are still around causing us problems today is because they like a lot of the same conditions we do! Many infectious bacteria are  , meaning they like temperatures between 20C and 40C - the human body is normally at 37C. A problem with cold temperatures is that the child may have a harder time breathing due to bronchospasm - a condition where the airways become narrower - and cold dry air causing irritation.  Colder air can also cause the shell on the influenza virus to harden, making it more infectious . Another consideration that you didn't mention is relative humidity. Both heaters and air conditioners can change our body's ability to dissipate moisture. When the moisture evaporates too fast, we can have irritation to our skin, nose, and throat.   It's probably best to keep the temperature and humidity at a level where the child is comfortable sleeping, within reason.	2016-02-21 16:53:11Z	neerajt	0

4678	4679	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4679	There is no brace position because you will not have warning of a car crash. Think about it. If there was warning, why would there be a crash? The driver would use the warning to avoid the crash. Unlike a pilot who must land the plane eventually regardless of conditions, a car driver can simply stop the car and get out. If, under some hard-to-imagine circumstance, you did know a crash was coming, the correct brace position would be simply sitting in a normal position. That's because that's the position auto designers assume you will be in and they design safety systems accordingly. In fact, they more than make that assumption -- they enforce it. When the crash detection system is activated, the first thing that happens is small explosives go off in the seatbelt mechanism causing it to retract tightly and forcibly, pulling you back against the seat and away from the airbags. So bracing your head against the dash or seat in front of you would be futile even if you tried. You would be yanked backwards against the seat. The one thing you absolutely must never do is have a child or pet on your lap. They are at great risk of being injured or killed by the airbag crushing them against your chest, which is likely to also injure you severely.	2016-02-06 16:46:51Z	Carey Gregory	6

The level of this hormone peaks in young men starting sometime after puberty, but usually in the late teenage or early twenty age range. Typically the level of this hormone in men starts to decrease between the ages of 30 - 40 or so, and at a slow rate; generally around one percent a year. As far as high testosterone levels and its benefits are concerned, I'll give a general breakdown of typical effects (physical and mental) but I will allow you to classify these as beneficial or not depending on your perspective of these effects. High levels of testosterone starting in early adulthood contribute to puberty transformations in the male body such as: genital organ growth, sexual maturity and fertility, growth of body and facial hair, and deepening of the voice. Higher levels of testosterone are also associated with   increased metabolism (burn fat faster), increased muscle mass, strength, and bone density. High levels of testosterone is associated with   more aggressiveness and the effects of such behavior such as feeling more competitive. It also contributes to sleeping better and feeling well-rested, having more energy, increase in sexual desire and libido, heightened focus and concentration, and more self confidence and motivation. 	2016-02-06 02:33:25Z	Facebook	5

Percentages are based on   for an adult. In essence, this diet is the same as living on sugar water, fiber and vitamins for two weeks. Without doubt you will lose weight consuming only 56% of a normal daily caloric intake. Unfortunately, a significant portion of that weight loss will be muscle since the diet meets less than half of your daily protein needs. It's also virtually devoid of fat, so it's quite likely you'd actually absorb far less of the fat soluble vitamins than it provides. You might also find that it would lead to dry skin and dry hair. No, two weeks on this diet wouldn't significantly harm a healthy adult, but frankly it's a hideous diet that would result mainly in short-term fat loss and long-term muscle loss, which would make it all the more difficult to keep the fat off going forward.	2016-02-07 17:28:07Z	Carey Gregory	4

Acne is a blocked or infected pore. When your skin is oily, the oil actually comes from pores that are not clogged. So the oil you feel when you touch your pimple (which BTW is a bad idea) is probably coming from surrounding pores . Reference: As for treatment, you can try over the counter acne products.

4655	4664	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4664	 got it right, any extra oil, grease, dirt, or other foreign matter will aggravate pimples. I had a moderate acne problem through most of my teenage years, and here are some things I learned: The rubbing alcohol helps prevent new pimples and gets rid of some small ones, but doesn't touch the big ones. I tried Acne-Free Severe for a while, and although it worked fine, it irritated my skin, which would get dry, itchy, and sometimes experienced a sensation approaching tingling. I hardly used it after a while because of that. Believing that the treatment was too severe, I tried Neutrogena Daily Scrub, along with their On the Spot treatment. It worked well for me without the dryness.  Edit: As I have mentioned, cleanliness seems to affect acne a great deal, and triggers eruptions, but it should be understood that the dirt is not what   acne . I highly recommend reading the page at  . Among other things, it states that acne isn't caused by dirt, and gives a professional assessment of a few related factors, as well as mentioning some possible courses of treatment. For severe cases, even some antibiotics can be prescribed by physicians. (But if it's not absolutely necessary, this course of treatment should be avoided, of course. :)  Also see  , from which I quote, "Acne is not caused by lack of cleanliness. Although not cleaning the affected or prone areas leads to accumulation of sebum and dirt in susceptible persons raising risk of acne." (Sebum and dirt cause pore blockage, resulting in acne breakouts.)  Also see  . Some of the content seems to contradict other sources, specifically, claiming that fatty foods make acne worse. While other sources refute this idea, this page points out the increased likelihood that your skin will become greasy from contact with such foods. (I would note that other health effects of avoiding fats are somewhat controversial, but since this is well beyond the realm of this discussion, I'll spare you from my viewpoint on the subject this time.) 	2016-02-06 02:06:14Z	Community	5

The injury that you suffered is a laceration, as opposed to an incision. The main difference between the two is the cleanliness of the edges, lacerations are more jagged, incisions are clean slices.

4645	5562	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5562	We were taught in medical school that the single biggest contributor to hangovers is dehydration. The degree of dehydration is caused by the percent concentration of ETOH/ethanol which is a diuretic (i.e. it makes you take many trips to restroom.) Dehydration from drinking causes a drop in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pressure. This is why a hangover headache is worse when you sit up or stand up. Your brain has less fluid support and is almost "dangling" on its suspensory supports. (This is an overstatement.)  Thus the effect of a hangover is almost purely correlated to the percent alcohol you are consuming rather than the class. At the risk of increasing drinking - this also suggests the number one way to   a hangover: fluid and salt. If you just drink water, your body cannot hold onto it. If you drink fluid with salt (i.e. gatorade, broth, or similar) - your headache will be substantially diminished because you will counteract the dehydration.  That said - alcohol is also toxic to the brain and liver. That's why your liver can hurt after drinking. If we draw LFTs lab tests on you, your liver enzymes will actually be elevated! (Michael Crichton, the author of Jurassic Park actually did that when he was a medical student at Harvard. You can read about it in his book Travels.) The liver damage is why people get scarred cirrhotic livers. You actually lose brain neurons every time you drink. Unfortunately...that part of the damage is not reversed with Gatorade and may account for some of the headache.	2016-04-21 21:36:24Z	Praxiteles	1

These are segments at each end of the long bones in your body where bone growth (and thus height increase) occur. They are cartilaginous plates that gradually increase the length of the bone by laying down new matrix. When they are fully closed and turned to bone themselves, growth has stopped. If the plates are not yet closed, then yes, you will probably grow some more. How much, that's not something that can really be determined. They can make predictions based on the xrays, but that is not a guarantee. If they are closed, then no, you won't grow any taller. Height is genetically determined, your body knows at birth how tall it's going to be.

To put it simply, your genetic code is the blueprint of your physical, and to some degree your cognitive, self. Just as many desirable and undesirable conditions have a genetic basis, so too are more and more psychological conditions being found to have a genetic component (as well as an environmentsl component that extends into the intrautering environment, but I'll ignore that now.) However, stress can actually alter the way DNA (your genetic code) is read; this is   - a change above the level of DNA that changes the expression on one's genes. There are many studies now   an epigenetic role in adult depression stemming from childhood trauma (e.g. child abuse). Studies also show that maternal stress can cause epigenetic changes  . Most of the studies are animal studies with very significant stressors - like diabetes, malnutrition (enough to cause intrauterine growth retardation), etc., but it is likely that less severe stressors can likely cause some epigenetic changes. The science here, though, is in it's infancy, and no predictions can be made. What should be kept in mind is that millions of women every year have high-stress pregnancies (some incredibly so) yet deliver infants who grow into well-adjusted adults.

4630	4634	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4634	It's not that they   meet. Meetings can and do happen and there's no medical reason they can't. In fact, most organ procurement programs have a system in place for allowing donors and recipients to meet. It's long been standard practice to withhold donors' and recipients' identities from each other for privacy reasons. As the above notes, telling either of them the other's identity would violate medical privacy laws in most countries since that information tells them something (perhaps a lot) about that other party's medical history. If identities are made known, it would definitely require written permission from both parties. But even without privacy laws, there's little or nothing to be gained by either party knowing the other's identity, and potentially a lot of conflict. For example, a family that has lost a loved one might very well not wish to be reminded of that by a recipient contacting them. And vice versa --  recipients might not want the discomfort of meeting the parents of the dead 16-year old whose organs are now theirs. It could be embarrassing, uncomfortable, and emotionally disturbing. There's also the risk of mental/emotional instability from either party. Can you imagine the nightmare of grieving parents feeling they just had to have a close personal relationship with you because you're walking around with their daughter's liver? Granted, marrow donors aren't usually deaths, but all the same principles still apply. In short, this is an ethics question, not a health question.

The response I got was that if it was allowed for the donor and the patient to meet in person, a strong emotional bond could be established between the two. In case another bone marrow transplant would be needed later, the decision to donate again, or not to, that donor would need to make, would be influenced by the personal relationship with the patient, and that's something this "no meet" rule is trying to prevent/limit. The length of a common 2 year period during which patient and donor cannot meet isn't arbitrary either - it takes around 2 years from the date of the transplant to be able to confirm, with a high enough certainty, that patient is going to be healthy in the long term, which means donor will not be (probably) asked for another donation. That's the explanation I got from that particular person in that particular clinic.

But when you take away the signal that comes from one of your senses, in this case your ears (not just because you are using hearing protection the loud noises from the machine overwhelm other noises), the computations the brain makes to give you representation of the environment you are in, is affected. When you are operating potentially dangerous machines, you may think you can rely on your vision, but you may underestimate that this is now affected by not getting any audio signals. If you see something under normal circumstances, you have to consider why you were looking in that direction in the first place. In many cases there could have been some noise that on a subconscious level made you look in that direction, while at the conscious level you don't have the information about that sound, it may look like a random action. So, without the audio signals, you wouldn't have looked in the right direction, potentially making you not noticing a problem that needed to be addressed. This does not mean that you should ignore any guidelines to use hearing protection. Rather, it means that you should stick to all the other safety instructions, like e.g. rigorously sticking to check lists when you may feel that's over the top, as well.

In the literature, some describe   (such as hormones, electrolytes, state of consciousness and body temperature) and   (sensory or electrical) that may reduce the epileptogenic threshold and hence trigger a seizure.

Dr. David Katz, reports in "O, the Oprah Magazine," that the body begins to store consumed calories as fat within four to eight hours from the beginning of the meal. As you consume these calories, the body automatically stores the first 1,000 calories within the liver and muscles for immediate energy reserves. This calorie storage is known as glycogen. Once the glycogen calories are utilized for energy, the body then activates stored calories within fat cells, known as triglycerides, to replenish the depletion of glycogen calories.	2016-10-28 11:44:30Z	Prince	-1

4585	4617	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4617	After doing some research on the issue, including contacting the company "Biomerica" and finding on the Internet the "Physician's Instruction Pamphlet" I did find that urine does affect such tests.  The mentioned pamphlet states: 1) Urinate first and then flush the toilet; 2) Have a bowel movement; 3) carefully drop a test tissue into the toilet bowl, etc.  Thus, Biomerica is adament that for the test to be reasonably accurate urine should be absent from the toilet bowl.  They also confirmed the same by email.   One should keep in mind that even if you take all those precautions you should understand that such tests are not "accurate" especially when they are positive.  This is due to such tests having a rather low sensitivity (true positive rate) combined with a disease that has a fairly low prevalence rate.  Quoting Wikipedia on fecal occult blood test with a positive result: "about 2-10% have cancer, while 20%-30% have adenomas."  Depending on one's circumstances those statistics can vary (age, sex) and increase a bit.  But, still a positive test result still leaves one much more likely to be free of colon cancer.  It is just an information piece that may suggest further test investigation may be warranted (colonoscopy, etc.).   In view of the above, following Biomerica's instructions I would not consider a positive test result with urine in the bowl as counting as a true positive test.  Instead, I would continue testing with the remaining test tissues and make sure I follow the appropriate protocol as indicated above.  If one would feel they did not have enough remaining test tissues, I would just get another set and re-test again.  If the individual does test negative three times in a row that should give her much comfort.  The test is far more accurate on "negatives" vs. "positives" because the test's specificity (true negative rate) is much above its sensitivity (true positive rate).     	2016-02-01 20:05:13Z	Sympa	-1

4577	4584	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4584	This is a broad question, but here are just a few major things to take into consideration after a surgical procedure. Early mobility has been shown for many years to be a major predictor of postoperative outcome, even in something like a hip fracture, where you would think rest was mandatory. The rapidity with which one returns to preoperative levels of independence in activities of daily living decreases postoperative morbidity and optimizes psychological well-being. Complications of "resting"  Postoperative pulmonary complications, specifically atelectasis and pneumonia, are the leading cause of postoperative morbidity and death. Confinement to bed is a very serious risk factor for atelectasis and pneumonia. After surgery - especially upper abdominal surgery - sufficiently deep breathing needed to prevent some degree of pulmonary compromise is painful. If you're up and moving, you will (voluntarily and involuntarily) be taking more and deeper breaths than you will at rest (characterized by shallower respirations), especially if you're on pain medications. Venous stasis and thromboembolism commonly occur postoperatively in patients who remain immobile. This is largely preventable with simple ambulation. It hurts to walk around after surgery, to be sure, but it's a lot better than suffering from a largely preventable pulmonary embolism. Loss of strength Bedrest results in loss of muscle mass and progressively more weakness. While it's not as great a consideration in younger adults as older adults, it is still considerable and, again, is largely preventable. Moving improves strength recovery, appetite, decreases stress, and overall increases feelings of well-being. Pain Medications Opioid medications usually given perioperatively can slow your bowels to almost a stand still (it's called  ) and can result in painful gas buildup and constipation. Moving, and to a lesser extent dietary changes, encourage the bowels to be less sluggish, as does a switch to non-opioid pain medications. Why "rest"?  Most people think healing is impaired by early movement after surgery. While this is true of some surgeries, it is far from true for all of them. When the risk of resting outweighs the benefits, the goal is to get patients moving.

4577	4579	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4579	There may be multiple reasons why your doctor advised you to move around after a surgery. One common theme that most surgeons follow is to avoid deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Post surgery, if the patients are bed ridden for too long, blood tends to accumulate in their calf muscle where there is a secondary blood pump that is active only if those muscles are working. Pooling of blood in the calf muscles increases the risk of formation of clots there, and these clots may be sent to lungs causing pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary embolism is a potentially life threatening state, and requires immediate treatment. So if the patient is at risk for developing pulmonary embolism before the surgery, the doctor would want to get in you on your feet as soon as possible. But if the patient is having too much difficulty while walking then there are equipment like calf massagers that does the job. Also, getting the patient on feet early creates a positive attitude and has shown to   in patients.  That said, there are conditions where the doctor would want you to do absolute bed rest, such as the conditions where there is increased risk of suture getting ripped due to increased abdominal pain. So if you have too much discomfort, then that is something that you would want to discuss with your doctor. 	2016-01-30 18:48:09Z	Rana Prathap	2
4577	4614	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4614	I have accepted an answer, but want to add one of my own with some more details I have observed as I go through the process (it's Day 5 today.) First, this is   to help yourself feel better. Compared to lying in bed, in pain, bored, possibly lonely and scared, and not sure what happens next, just waiting to get better. Giving you something you can do that will improve yourself will, in and of itself, improve you, even if nothing physiological was happening. Second, it really does work. The vast majority of the pain and effort is simply in getting onto your feet. I noticed quite dramatically that once I had taken 5 or 10 steps I began to feel much better. My pain went down, my strength went up. I am not sure if that was because of increased heart rate and respiration, or the venous return from walking, but there was unmistakably an improvement simply from walking. Several times I would complete the walking distance I had set myself and want to do double or triple that because it was making me feel better. Third, while you are lying in bed everything is insanely difficult. To reach over and get your drink might involve 10 or more different movements, each of which hurt. Just shifting your weight a little or moving an inch or two to one side you have to fight gravity, drag your body against the bed, etc. Blowing your nose, drinking, changing an uncomfortable position - these things are too hard to do. But when you're vertical, it's far less work to lean a little or turn a little. So you look after your needs better. That means you're less likely to be dehydrated, or to have a coughing fit from stuff you snuffled and swallowed that you should have blown out, or to hurt from lying the wrong way for an hour. This is even more important at home where you don't have beds that can lie you up and down, or tables that swing over the bed to keep things within reach. Fourth, as with my previous abdominal surgeries I notice that I often need to pee without feeling that sensation of needing to pee at all. Since I'm up and moving anyway, I can stop by the toilet and see if I need to go. Invariably I feel much better, with a huge reduction in pain and improvement in movement, once my bladder is empty. But I hadn't felt an urge that would have pushed me to go through the pain of standing up to deal with it. Fifth, if this is the norm, especially in the hospital, it makes it easy to spot people who are not recovering at the expected pace. If everyone just lies in bed for 5-6 days waiting to get better, some of them will be majorly ill but you might not notice. If everyone gets up and walks around, the one who can't will stick out like a sore thumb and their infection or whatever will be noticed hours or even days sooner. While I am still not clear on the exact mechanism that makes this work, I can report that it really does work, on a very small time scale. If you feel awful, getting up and walking for one minute can make you feel better. I still find this counter-intuitive but am pleased that it's standard procedure where I (and my relative) live, because it's clearly helpful.	2016-02-01 15:30:07Z	Kate Gregory	2

These tears are caused when two things happen at the same time. Yes - in this case meaning adolescent and teenage years. The reasons are twofold: First, these are years when your body is undergoing changes in shape and composition. The skin has to stretch to accommodate these changes. Second, something we haven't discussed yet is the effect of cortisol on collagen synthesis. Cortisone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland in response to stress among other things. It's been shown to inhibit collagen synthesis, effectively making the skin (and cartilage in the joints) less stretchy.

4571	15372	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15372	That is true, in principle. A bit slower is usually at least a bit better. The same principle that differentiates olive oil grades can be applied to juices. A proper (albeit quite small) study on this seems to confirm this.  The slower juicers as well as the slower settings for multi speed devices increased the yield of the product compared with higher speeds. The assayed activity of the extracted enzymes, polyphenols etc was uniformly higher as well. But aside the small study design these differences were not earth shattering. (Disclaimer: parts of my interpretation relys on very limited knowledge of Korean and the aid of machine translation.) Luckily, the same team also published in English: Same team, same methods, same limitations and problems. Since an undisclosed conflict of interest might be involved in endorsing so clearly commercial products (even as whole classes): These findings should be taken with a grain of salt regarding the health benefits. 
Interpreting the results from these diagrams also has to account for different yields from the same source materials. While the concentration might be higher in a given glass, the efficiency of extraction and the total amount of deemed beneficial constituents from the sources is not to be equated with "juicers are better than the fruits and vegs themselves."  If, however, another, more subjective criterion would be permitted to judge the quality, just trust your nose and tongue. The taste of slower and more carefully prepared juices is usually more enjoyable.	2018-02-18 14:14:22Z	LangLangC	1

The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) mandates a high standard of quality for inspection and adjusts its actual allowed variance based on multiple criteria, including the severity of the effects of a discrepancy in dosage.  Variability is viewed through two perspectives. The rate of absorption and the extent of absorption. These two rates are compared to associated brands of similar medications and within that a difference of 20% is considered significant by the FDA and so a range of approximately 80% to 125% is used for the acceptable window. While this does suggest that a medication can vary by 45% from another brand, the FDA requires that the ratios of the rate and extent both fall within the window as well as a 90% confidence interval to be considered equivalent to another brand. Although theoretically any can vary by a large percentage, if these requirements are met then the practical effect by variance will remain low.

For example, in a paper I wrote, I characterized the cases of disease in a population as "Low-level endemic spread, punctuated by periodic, short-lived outbreaks". These outbreaks were on the scale of less than a dozen people, so I'd really have a hard time calling it an epidemic, but again, this is referencing the idea that "outbreak" refers to a somewhat smaller geographical scale.	2016-01-29 19:41:57Z	Fomite	7

4525	7285	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7285	As you mentioned in the side note, it really depends on the type of pill. Because there are chemical interactions between the food and the pill e.g.  tetracycline and milk (tetracycline and calcium form complexes, thus inactivating the antibiotic). Generally the gastric pH is not so important for the drug uptake, as it happens in the small intestine. However some drugs can get destroyed in acid, therefore some pills have an acid resistant coating. 
This coat is usually a weak acid. Since the gastric pH is very low (1-3) weak acids stay protonated, thus are not polar and can't be solved in water. Later in the duodenum the pH varies between 8-9, the coating weak acid deprotonates and dissolves. The drug is set free. This is the reason why you can't split all pills! The reason why you should eat some food with some medicaments is that they can irritate your gastric lining (e.g. diclofenac) and food serves as a buffer as it "dillutes" the medicament. Other substances need the food to function properly e.g. iron needs to be taken with orange juice or other vitamin c rich juices (the gastric acid oxidates  , but   cannot be absorbed, therefore vitamin c is needed as a reduction agens). The question which food is the best can't really be answered as each patient is different. As long as the food does not harm the medication any food you like is good. Usually some crackers are enough, however if you start to feel stomach pain, eating more would be a good idea. Since most medicaments should be taken at a fixed time of the day, taking them 5 minutes after a regular meal is a good idea.  However some food should not be eaten while taking medication because they induce/inhibit the cytochrome P450 system in the liver and therefore leading to insufficent or dangerous high blood levels of the medicamention.	2016-07-02 17:36:57Z	KTB	3

I include the medical terms, mostly because it may help finding further reading beyond what I suggest. An approachable introduction to percutaneous absorption is   written by Dr. Paul Brisson (it was in fact, used a source text in my schooling). Lateral diffusion, how any drug spreads out from the application site as opposed to down through the skin,  .  This is often measured as cm /h, as the diffusion happens over time.  It should be noted that even with the constant application of the patch, you are going to get reduced diffusion based on concentrations gradients which roughly follow  .   A standard salt gel formulation of DK (which is a good baseline, as any modifications will be at best 100x change in ether direction) has a lateral diffusion coefficient of   cm /h, and a rough saturation time of about  .  Even if we assume 10 hours of diffusion, and a 100X increase in the coefficient ( ), that still only gives us   lateral diffusion.  Let's round that off to an even 97 square nanometers. That's smaller than the cross sectional area of many viral particles.  So you are quite right, a patch is most directly treating the area that it is directly on top of.  But this ignores another factor in patch dosing, which is that the drug is transferred to the plasma (blood), and then distributed systemically throughout the body.  Thus a significant portion of the dose that a prescribing physician is intending you to recieve might be through delivery from the blood. So yes, you can sometimes cut a patch to deliver the drug better to a local area, but you should first check with your medical professional to be sure that the type of patch you are using can in fact be cut and still effective (some the nanogel suspensions can't be).	2016-04-13 17:12:28Z	Atl LED	3

Serotonin stimulates hypothalamic TRH (Thyroid Releasing Hormone) production, leading to an increase in TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) production from the pituitary. Serotonin stimulates hypothalamic TRH production which leads to an increase in TSH production from the pituitary. Adequate serotonin production is necessary to maintain thyroid hormone levels. Theoretically, an excess of serotonin may lead to the opposite reaction. For example, excess serotonin can lead to a reduction in dopamine production, which can then lead to an increase in norepinephrine production, leading to an increased stress response and cortisol production. When your serotonin levels are low, you feel anxious, depressed, and pessimistic, and you might also struggle with sleep problems — all common symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism.  Sources:

4456	4528	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4528	To provide a brief answer, as I think a sufficient answer would be far beyond the scope of this site, the symptoms that are "generic" to the common colds are all caused by the body's response to a pathogen (it's why they are generic).  Specific pathogens tend to cause additional symptoms on top of that, some of which seem to be directly related to viral damage. First, I want to point out to a very nice   from the   (CCP).  The   from the comprising trails is a good repository for information on the common cold.  *It should be noted that there were a few experimental design problems that they were unable to avoid (for a combination of cost and lack of knowledge).  It turned out the the   challenge strain used in the British study was not a very   strain.  Further, as it has   of symptoms meant that it wasn't well studied with in the time frame of the trial.  That said, it provides a good deal of details on  , and the "common cold" more generally. This might seem like a more obvious question, but it's what must be answered first before the broader question of what is being caused by the virus is addressed. One of the better lists of symptoms comes from the first   mentioned in the CCP: [Table 3, ibid] Not a single one of these is actually caused "directly" by the virus, but it kind of get's back to what can the virus do?  Viruses are very small obligate parasites that rely on changing host systems to replicate and spread their genetic material. If we take a look at the snotty, cough, and sneezy symptoms (cough, bronchoconstriction and airway mucus secretion), they are all " " by   (RARs) along the airway.  That is to say, the damage the viruses do actually cause to cells along the airway is detected by RARs either through the cell debris, chemical signaling (indirect activation from other cells), or direct interaction of immune cells. If we look at a runny and stuffed up nose (rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction) specifically,   that   are coming to the sinuses and inducing inflammation and mucus over production. This is where the question gets very broad very quickly.  I will deal with three viruses as examples: HRV, RSV, and influenza.  Some of the best sentinel data on colds, at least   to seek medical treatment, has been coming from China. The two leading candidates from   are HRV and RSV (also true in US, see a related   of mine).  I want add in flu because it has some other interesting traits. Both HRV and RSV often are   of other viruses or bacteria, but RSV is more likely to have this problem [ibid].  While "drained" resources while fighting the common infection might be a partial explanation for this,   that RSV produces two proteins, NS1 and NS2, which directly inhibit the innate immune system.  This could explain the high rate of co-infection with RSV.  Which leads me to the first general thing that viruses do, directly counter the immune system of a host. Another   would be what kind of direct cell damage ( ) the virus might do.    and   tends to destroy the airway epithelial barrier by infecting and killing the epithelial cells (this sets of the RARs).  HRV on the other hand, doesn't often kill the cells off, but just disrupts their function [ibid].  Thus the second general thing viruses do is "kill" or "disrupt" the cells they infect. The final action of a virus I want to look at goes back to a symptom that is on our list, myalgia.  Of our three viruses, this is most closely associated with flu.  Though the exact mechanisms may vary, it is   to be caused   release. Here's a good example where answering the question of what is "caused" by the virus is tricky.  Some influenza strains produce proteins where a main function seems to be inducing cytokines.  This can lead to all kinds of bad things like a  .  But flu also needs to cause an up regulation of   to help process it's proteins.  This might be done indirectly through a cytokine or directly from a viral protein.  Either way the trypsin can remain in the tissue causing damage to host proteins after the virus has moved on (been cleared).  So would we say this was tissue damage caused by the virus?  It wasn't an immune response in the normal sense, and it was started by the virus, but then again the trypsin is not a viral protein. That leads to my final overly generic statement about viruses, they activate complicated pathways with all kinds of incidental downstream consequences (normally bad).  Imagine if someone was in front of a power breaker box randomly turning off and on switches.  If the food was spoiled in the refrigerator would you say it was because the refrigerator wasn't on, or because somebody pulled the fuse out?	2016-01-26 22:49:26Z	Community	6

If you doubt this, consider how much money is spent on cosmetic surgery every year just for facial creases. They can be filled with collagen or other substrate, they can be stretched, the muscles around a crease can be relaxed, decreasing the depth of the crease (this is how botox works), but the crease is there. Very fine creases (or wrinkles) can be diminished by contact irritants (e.g. retinoic acid preparations, vegetable acids, and other preparations) which cause mild edema (stretching the skin) and reactive skin changes which in toto reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Obesity normally causes deepening of normal skin folds and the creation of deep skin folds from superficial ones (for example truncal-abdominal skin-folds.) Once this process occurs, the structure of the skin itself is irreversibly changed. If very prominent (for example after weight loss in the morbidly obese), surgery can be done to remove the excess skin and the fold itself (but a scar will replace it). Aloe vera will not help. However, moisturizers may diminish their appearance a bit, as will good posture.

Mechanisms responsible for this may include a prolongation
of gastric emptying time,reduced rate of intestinal absorption and reduced food intake. In addition to fructose, oligosaccharides such as palatinose (isomaltulose) present in honey have been reported to delay digestion and intestinal absorption of glucose resulting in reduced glycemia Additionally, fructose has also been shown to stimulate glucokinase in hepatocytes which plays a significant role in the uptake and storage of glucose (as glycogen) by the liver. Likewise, Honey contains a number of mineral elements such as zinc, selenium, copper, calcium, potassium, chromium, manganese and so on. Some of these minerals such as chromium are recognized for their role in the reduction of elevated blood glucose, maintenance of normal glucose tolerance and insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cells. Honey as an antidiabetic agent is likely to be more effective and beneficial if combined with conventional antidiabetic therapy.  If combined with conventional antidiabetic drugs or insulin, the use of honey may necessitate lower doses of these synthetic drugs or insulin to achieve similar glycemic control. 1.

4426	11385	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11385	The question asks if carbohydrates lead to more fatty mass gain than the other macronutrients: fat and protein (and alchohol), if consumed at the same calorie level.  To put it another way:  The common tautology employed by people proving that macro-nutritional profile is not important when it comes to weight loss is "a calorie is a calorie".  If you're really looking for a metabolic advantage through manipulating macronutrient, you'd be far better off putting your money on protein. There's actually some evidence that higher intake levels do convey a small metabolic advantage. Unsurprisingly, the studies into macronutrient impact on mass change are numerous but by no means perfect. One has to cast a very critical eye over all the conflicting evidence (and mud-slinging) and make their own decision.  A good meta analysis of the above tautology by the well-respected Buchholz AC & Schoeller DA. concluded that: This referenced a ward study (amongst others which also concluded the same): To continue the evidence-train for there being no win in carbs-vs-fat: In a 2003 study by Bravata DM, et al. the conclusion was that nutritional-profile really doesn't affect total weight change at a significant level.  A 2009 study directly comparing the weight loss "fad" diets concluded that provided you reduce calories, the method you do this is not of importance: A 1996 study also concluded the same thing:  An Australian study put them head-to-head over 12 months and didn't find a large difference:  A 2010 study went a step further and did a 2-year study across over 300 participants; patients lost an average of 7 kg or 7% of body weight, and no differences between the 2 groups were found: Taking a different view and looking at weight gain, there are fewer studies but the evidence points to the same outcome.  This can be also seen in this small 2000 study: A important point to note is that dietary fat   what is stored as bodily fat, when a caloric excess is consumed. For dietary carbohydrate to be stored as fat then they must undergo a conversion through 'de novo lipogenesis' which will occur when the carbohydrate portion of someone's diet alone must approach or exceed ones total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).

Calories that you consume is your energy in and calories that you expend is your energy out. If energy in > energy out, you will gain weight. The opposite, you will lose weight.  People go wrong in understanding the use of carbohydrates in the body. Carbs are your body's preferred source of energy (not the only source of energy). If consumed well in the limit and understanding your body's response to carbs, you can lose weight while eating carbs as well.  Now lets say you are consuming carbs throughout majority of your calories, then yes in some cases your body's ability to tap into fat sources for deriving energy drops down as there is a lot of glycogen (storage form of carbs in body) available already. So in short, carbs have to be regulated and had smartly.

The most common form of this is known as polymorphic light eruption (PMLE), also known as sun poisoning[1,2]. This is characterized by redness of the skin found on the arms, wrists, neck, and other areas. Here is a picture of this: (From  ) Based on your description, this is what is going on. Your friend has mild PMLE. Pheromones have nothing to do with this problem at all. How does this happen? Scientists aren't fully sure. However, what we do know based on our knowledge of allergies is that the sun-exposed skin. The sun must be altering the skin in some way[2].  How does this have to do with eosinophilia? Well, eosinophilia means there is more eosinophils and eosinophils are responsible for allergies, so there will be more allergic reactions to more things. However, eosinophilia and photo-sensitivity both are symptoms of drug allergy[3]. Perhaps your friend is allergic to some drug. For example, I found that eosinophilia and photosensitivity could be an allergy to Lisinopril[4]. I am not sure about the drug history of your friend so I cannot say anything more but she should go to the doctor for sure.	2016-01-17 06:30:21Z	TanMath	4

4413	4633	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4633	This is an excellent question. In my attempt to answer it I'll cite sources from the best research on the subject to date, and we'll conduct our own investigation. In your question, you asked how body size (weight and height) relates to brain volume by gender. Body size is related to brain volume through another measure, head size. Larger body, larger head, larger brain.  Men and women have different body sizes, and different head sizes as well.   In the paper you referenced, Gur et. al. looked at 80 healthy (40 male and 40 female) volunteers aged 18-45 years. They used an automated parcellation approach, meaning they used automated image processing on the brain images to derive their measurements. In our investigation, we'll use data frome the publicly available  , or HCP. We'll look at 896 healthy (393 Male and 503 female) volunteers aged 22-36 years. HCP also used an automated parcellation software, called FreeSurfer.  We'll use IntraCranial Volume - the volume inside the cranium - to represent head size. 
 We see here that men have larger brains than women. We can also see from the linear model results that the estimated mean difference from our sample is a substantial 153.9 milliliters (as compared to ~200 milliliters in Gur et. al. 2001). For reference, this is about 2/3 one of those half pint boxes of milk you used to get at school lunch. But how much is total brain volume related to head size? We can see right away that these two measures are highly correlated. It makes sense. Typically, bigger animals -- with corresponding bigger heads -- have bigger brains: But what you want to know is whether the difference remains  . In other words, is the difference disproportionate to head size? Here we use a method called residualizing to remove the effect of ICV on TBV we observed above. You can find the code we're using  , and a reference describing the procedure in detail  . Let's check the graph of TBV vs ICV again, to make sure the effect is removed. Here we'll reexamine the difference between Male and Female brain sizes using the adjusted values.
 
 The difference is still statistically significant, but smaller. The linear model estimates the adjusted average difference to be 23.6 milliliters (compared to 153.9 before). Going back to the milk reference, this is about 1/10 the box, or one sip. We found that the difference in brain volumes between men and women is partially, but not completely explained by their difference in head sizes. The difference is smaller, but still there after adjusting.   Do these differences in brain volume explain anything about behavior or ability? That's where papers like the one you referenced come in.  Gur et. al. suggest in their paper that females compensate for smaller total brain volume by having increased gray matter, and therefore more tissue available for computation. Other studies conclude that in order to understand gender differences in cognitive ability, you have to look closer at the parts of the brain that are activated during different tasks. The HCP data could help us test these ideas too, but that's outside the scope of your question.	2016-02-02 15:42:43Z	neerajt	2

And yes, tampons can cause lower abdominal pain in the presence of endometriosis (ectopic endometrial tissue). The symptoms of endometriosis can include pain on micturition, defecation, tampon or diaphragm insertion, increased pain with menses, intercourse, etc. Use of tampons in healthy females is generally well-tolerated. Edited to address OP's edit: Tampons are generally well tolerated by healthy, normal females. However, there are groups of females that do find tampon use uncomfortable, chief among them adolescents. For this reason, physicians often speak with adolescents at menarche about tampon use. In other words, young girls should use smaller tampons. Pain with tampon use in this age group is more likely and in some cases can lead to problems with pain later on.

Pain relief (both physical and emotional) is a significant part of medicine, yet we still have "pain scales" for self-reported pain, one of the more common ones being the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale: To try to accurately assess pain (which is still  ), a patient's scale should be interpreted by a caregiver using examples   (If the person has had severe kidney stones, for example, the examiner can use that as a "10".)  No, we don't expect a lot of 8/9/10s on the scale. We hope it will be used exactly as you have described: in many cases, 10 is described by a caregiver as "the worst pain you ever had." If the patient has never had severe pain before (kidney stones, childbirth [for most], etc.) the pain has to be imagined. Left to their own devices, a patient might look like a 6, but be reporting a 10. In this case, a nurse must try to ascertain their actual level of their pain. But still, it is their pain, and how it is felt differs from person to person, which is why no objective criteria can be assigned the pain scale.  	2015-12-26 19:34:21Z	YviDe	9

4386	5373	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5373	I'll give two perspectives: 1) human factors engineer and 2) chronic pain patient.  1) When trying to objectify a subjective item like pain, a common set of tasks are applied to level the field and serve as a reference against which to measure. A common scale is called the  . I have used it to quantify a pilot's ability to complete tasks like landing, hovering around an airport and turning. In the case of pain, neerajit mentions activities of daily living, and those would include dressing, urinating and having bowel movements, maintaining communications, having a stable mood, eating, drinking, etc. When assessing pain, a 4-6 might interfere with the ability to do the task even significantly, but it probably would not cause deterioration of the patient's health. These scales work much better for acute pain or how pain responds to treatment in an acute setting to treatment. For chronic pain, a scale is applied like this one,  , but it is applied more to how much the pain interferes with activities over say the previous two weeks overall. How does it affect overall quality of life, relationships, ability to work, walk, do housework, socialize, etc. This brings me to perspective #2. 2) Pain and experiencing the sensation of pain can be scary for someone who never experiences; the same can be true for the opposite. What I mean by that is people who are in pain and who experience it regularly do not necessarily know that their experience is different, and they learn to work within the experience of pain.  To measure my experience of being in pain and experience too strong of sensations, I had to have people point out to me that what I experience is not what everyone else experience. I do NOT experience it the same way. In my case, this awareness was realized because I felt so much frustration in the amount of effort it took in order to accomplish similar work compared to what I used to be able to do or as compared to my colleagues. This measure is also relative because it is only against a small subset.  Another measure that I use for my own pain is the amount of discomfort that I see my colleagues or even my own doctors in when they watch me in pain. I personally find this fascinating because most of the time, I am really just trying to get something done while pushing through. I can be just as distracting or more for them as it is for me.  These are my two different ways to attempt to objectify a very subjective experience. A good post-script attempt to this objectification would be to somehow quantify via black-white contrast the patient's pain experience through them drawing it. When I look at Pain Art, it tends to be very raw with high contrast, and the ultimate measure for a 10 on a 0-10 scale would be no drawing at all because the patient couldn't do it. That is my afterthought.	2016-04-07 01:31:14Z	Lilibete	0
4384	4445	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4445	The easy answer is that skin turns over, and rather quickly at that. Specialized skin cells called melanocytes impart more or less melanin (through granules called melanosomes) to keratinocytes; these cells then are what give you a tan. The keratinocytes undergo constant turnover, so are eventually shed, and in the absence of continued exposure to UV radiation, there is no need to keep producing melanin-heavy keratinocytes. (It's a bit more complicated, but that's the basic idea.)  In other words, for a light-skinned individual, light skin is normal, healthy, and appropriate. A tan represents response to a level of damage. When the damage ceases, the skin stops producing the unnecessary cells and the unnecessary pigmentation. Yes. Darker skin is less conducive to production of Vitamin D. This is why Southern Asians living in northern European cities are more prone to Vitamin D deficiency. Also, when exposed to UV radiation, melanin can itself become somewhat toxic to cells, the photosensitization generating superoxide radicals which can injure individual cells. So the risk having melanin must be outweighed by the protective effect of melanin against UV light. It's a delicate balance.  Continued exposure to UV light stimulates the melanocytes to grow. This increases the chance of the development of melanomas. Since skin cells containing melanin are shed (there's no getting around that), in light-skinned individuals, keeping a tan is to keep injuring the skin and risking carcinogenesis.

4372	4397	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4397	The short answer is  , it doesn't, at least as long as your not also coupling it with something like auto-asphyxiation, which is so dangerous for many other reasons before hair loss. First the medical term for the harmless hair loss in males is "alopecia" (might help online searches).  The   of male hair loss is Androgenic alopecia (AGA), and the most common mechanism for this is buildup of 5α-DHT in the hair follicle (ibid).  5α-DHT comes from testosterone (T) after being modified by an enzyme.  It then shortens the amount of time the hair has to grow: 
 The false argument that masturbation would lead to hair loss then goes something like this: Putting it in more formal logic may be giving to much credit to those proposing the theory, but it let’s address where the critical problems are.  The first thing to attack is 3.  This was probably not the aim of any study, but is a tangential finding in a few studies.   looked at the T levels of men and self-reported masturbation frequency and found no correlation (they were actually studying sex drive).  I couldn’t find an example of study which took males from a base line “fast” of masturbation, recorded T levels, and then had them masterbate, and I don’t really know who would fund such a clinical study (but that would directly answer the question). So what does effect T levels?  Other than non-natural sources like steroids, things like  ,  , and  .  Also, you don't want to reduce your T levels if you can avoid it, as it is likely providing several positive benefits. The loss the third statement already puts a hole in the logic, but statements 1 and 4 also pose problems.   It is not the global (systemic) production of 5α-DHT that is the problem.  In fact any significant amount of 5α-DHT in the sera is probably a sign of other problems.  Rather, it’s the   of 5α-DHT within the hair follicle that leads to AGA.  Further that over production of 5α-DHT is more closely linked to higher levels of the 5α-reductase enzyme that synthesiszes 5α-DHT from T (ibid).  In  turn the enzyme levels are likely set  , with environmental factors like diet and stress adjusting from your baseline (speculation, looking for a source).	2016-01-14 16:53:41Z	Atl LED	9

These neurons are triggered by 1) impulses incoming from the enteric nerve network (motor neurons which partake in peristalsis) and 2) a number of hormones, including GLP1, orexins, cholestokynin and the leptin/ghrelin pair. It is however not yet entirely clear if we know all hormones involved, and what mechanisms determine the release of these hormones.

Further "smelling something" with an infectious respiratory virus (rhino, influenza, etc) can certainly cause an infection.  I would highly discourage sniffing used tissues. A bigger concern are pathogens like   which are so infectious, possibly down to 10 virions to cause infection (instead of 1000s or more), that it could enter your oral tract without your even knowing it.

Much of the in-depth research hasn't been done on healthy individuals (biomechanics of the foot), but where there's something wrong (pathomechanics of the foot).  There is also a difference between what is theoretically best ( ) and what people actually do ( ).  Also, the search terms might not be readily apparent because the biomechanical word for "standing" is "stance" (eg "load distribution in stance"). The best models and papers I found were also behind pay walls (which my institution has access to), but I can summarize the information as follows: There are 6 main points of pressure in the healthy foot: the heel, and the head of each (5)  : The metatarsal head of the hallux (big toe, labeled 2 above) should take about 2x the pressure as the other 4 heads, which roughly balances the left to right load on the foot. As far as front to back, the only reference I found that calculated an ideal position was the one I  , and seemed to indicate the heel should receive 52.6% +/- 1.36% of the load of the foot (Fig 7).  Presumably the rest of the weight would then be distributed to the metatarsal heads as mentioned above. I will say that was calculated with math I don't quite understand, and on a very idealized adult foot.  It might be much more useful to ask the question: "How do people with healthy feet and gates distribute the load on their feet?" That would go back to my   and give us this lovely figure: [Fig 1] My final conclusion is that if you are concerned about your gate you should see an OT or PT.

This is common.   And, it doesn't make a difference if it's caffeinated or not.   Although, some people do a bit better with cold pressed coffee.  Seems to be a bit less acid. 
Don't take this lightly.  Over a life time it can cause many problems.  Oh, and please quit getting medical advice on-line.  A cough can be a sign of something serious. 	2017-01-07 05:08:28Z	hjr	-1

All the usual suspects were ruled out. Asthma, GERD, etc. It was suspected that I had laryngeal sensory neuropathy and taking 1/2 a tramadol a day helped. Then quite by accident, I read about laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Although I don't have GERD - I tried Nexium and Prilosec early on, LPR seems to be the issue. I was tested by an ENT doctor and he gave me a list of items to avoid. Coffee was it for me. Within two days my coughing stopped. I can drink weak decaf tea but not decaf coffee. Cooked tomato sauce is another trigger.	2017-11-27 22:19:53Z	Melanie	-3
4335	4406	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4406	So this was an interesting one for me, because I never seriously tried to consider it.  Most online sources that claim this say it's an "old army trick," but after reading   perspectives on wound care in the  , I don't know that is true. The actual historical roots on this idea I could find actually go back to reference a   using it as a form of abuse to over work his slave, or a   story from 1915. The problem is one of timing.  As wars started to utilize gun powder more, tourniquets were realized to be superior to cauterization (first ideas of tourniquets go back to ~1500's, serious implantation with Jean Petit in early 1700's).  By the time we get to something like Vietnam, not only would the solders have had tourniquets, if they were going to cauterize the wound they would have done it chemically. Another problem is the gas and force released from igniting gun powder.  It doesn't just burn hot, it propels.  That's why it's useful for moving bullets.  I think this would likely further distort the tissue, and if applied in large amounts in to major arteries/veins, a good deal of toxicity problems. I just honestly think this would cause more harm than good.  I'd be very interested if someone can find a documented example of where this was actually tried in the field (and I missed it).  Considering you can't readily treat your own neck, the appropriate thing to do would be to apply direct pressure with your hands to the places that are bleeding the most (or if you're the one helping, then the same to the other person's neck).   Oddly enough I have a   written up in Bio, for those interested in proper wound care in the neck. I was made aware the "Dual Survival" episode where one of the characters cauterizes a wound (  and then  ).  You will note that even the survivalist unequivocally rejected this method as valid before he did it to himself (presumably for considerable compensation from Discovery Channel).  I reject this as a valid example for the following reasons: Again, the wound in the video doesn't even call for a tourniquet, to say nothing of cauterization.  This is an example of something that makes sensational TV does not make good medical sense, and probably helps spread medical misconceptions and ignorance (as the premise of the show is to help demonstrate survivalist techniques).	2016-01-15 04:38:23Z	Atl LED	5

Points (1) and (4) are important when you're a kid, they doesn't matter to you now. Point (2) is about improved self-repair and acid resistance. This is some very good property of fluoride, but it may not be so well understood and so effective as it is often presented. Quote from " " (1999): (So this is not so simple just to have low levels of fluoride.) If you sincerely keep good dental habits which include also proper diet and mouth washing, then you could rely on your natural remineralization.

4317	11676	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/11676	Masturbating does not decrease fertility or sex drive Historically, masturbation was discouraged for a variety of reasons including the thought that it lead to mental health problems.  However, that was disproved.  The abstract of   states Masturbation was a diagnosable psychological condition until DSM II in 1968. (Ley, 2014) The American Medical Association consensually declared masturbation as normal in 1972. Due to the false ideas on masturbation and mental health, there are not a lot of documented studies but I am going to concentrate on fairly recent studies to eliminate the falsehoods. Another point of note mentioned in   is that Since sperm are short-lived, they must constantly be replenished, so  . Plus sperm is produced during the whole of the male life. If the dead sperm is not released through sex or masturbation, it will automatically be released by the body. Some males find that they are more prone to   during times of less frequent sexual activity because they are not ejaculating as frequently from masturbation or sex with a partner, and in fact — as @Gabri pointed out, and studies have confirmed — high ejaculation frequency was related to decreased risk of total prostate cancer  . There is even less around for female masturbation, but one study suggests that female orgasm induces ovulation   so that would suggest that the chances of conception would be higher.  The difference between men and women is that  .  The human female has all their eggs at birth and no more is being produced. Once they are all released, that's it. Coleman, E. (2003).

Moreover, some specialists say that masturbation can prevent, or at least decrease, the risk of develop a prostate cancer. Keep in mind that these are new studies, so data are too few to create a rule.
With the informations that researchers obtain, they can say that the risk is reduced (1).
But as I stated before, there are not enough data to confirm this (2). In addition to this, the spermatogenic cycle is different from the female one: female have a fixed number of egg follicles, while men production of sperm is cycle (Spermatogenesys take 64 days, and it's continuous). So, if sperm cells are not used for fertilize egg cells, they will die and after short time the cycle of production start again (please, keep in mind that the process is way more difficult and specific; this is a overview to explain what the user asked). So, no. Masturbation doesn't decrease your fertility and if studies are confirmed, it may prevent from prostate cancer.

4286	13541	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13541	In some people stress can cause an increase in urination. The form of stress may be physical or emotional. Since the control of aldosterone is partly under the influence of the brain, any type of nervous stimulus or mental stress can affect its secretion.  When an individual has physical stress, there is increased release of the stress hormones, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon and cortisol, all of which can affect urination.  Two of these "fight or flight hormones" - epinephrine and norepinephrine have direct and indirect effects on urine production. When these hormones act directly on the kidneys and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) remains constant. 
 The result is a decrease in urinary output.  Conversely, the indirect effects of these hormones increase MAP, resulting in increased urine output.  It’s role is to regulate blood pressure and sodium levels.  Water, sodium and aldosterone levels are all directly related.  When your body’s aldosterone levels are high – so are your levels of sodium and water.  thus less is secreted. This reverse of this process also holds true. Since the control of aldosterone is partly under the influence of the brain, any type of nervous stimulus can affect its secretion.  Under chronic stress this works slightly differently. First cortisol levels will increase.  This leads to decreased levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which results in increased urination. As stress levels remain high cortisol levels eventually drop. Your adrenal gland becomes unable to produce sufficient levels of aldosterone – which once again causes an increase in urination.

4283	4299	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4299	Ribs have an important role to play: they  . They wouldn't be very good at it if something as minor as a break was likely to allow a rib to poke and puncture things. The ribs act as a unit (they all move at the same time) and they offer a lot of protection to the heart, lungs, etc., because they are attached to each other and the muscles around them. You say: Look at the diagrams below, and imagine a fractured rib. A broken rib is not wild canon likely to do any of the above. Note carefully the amazing amounts of connective tissues (fascia, muscles, tendons, and ligaments) that attach to the "rib cage", stabilizing it. The ribs are stabilized externally by groups of muscle. These attach to tough fascia surrounding the ribs. Between the ribs are three separate groups of muscles running in three different directions (diagonally back to front; vertically top to bottom, and diagonally front to back) attaching securely each (section of each) rib to the one above and below it. Finally they are attached to the spine and the breastbone. This is why rib fractures heal without splinting. The ribs aren't going anywhere; they basically stay put even when they are fractured.  The   of rib fractures are non-displaced, followed by minimally displaced ribs. These heal in place (even with continued movement and activity) through the usual process of callus formation, because there's nowhere for the ribs to go. Eventually the callus becomes big enough to contain both fractured ends of the rib and reunion takes place. Rib fractures might cause pheumothorax or hemothorax if the rib is struck with great and narrowly focused force: the end of a baseball bat swung full force, or being thrown (rarely simply falling) against an immovable projecting object. Even then, in most cases the rib is not repaired; if it is projecting into the pleural space, it is manipulated to be less so, and kept under observation until healed or no longer a danger. Under certain circumstances, rib fractures must be surgically repaired; this is when enough multiple adjacent ribs are fractured at multiple places so that that a significant segment of the rib cage no longer functions as the rest of it does; this is called a  . Since respiration is compromised, this has to be repaired. One or two fractured ribs are rarely a cause for concern (as opposed to what caused them). Multiple rib fractures, especially adjacent, indicate greater level of trauma and must be treated differently because of underlying injury or the high risk of developing pneumonia or other complications:

The weak spots are such that, no, you generally don't have the pokey bit lying on the heart or lungs. (It   happen and it's serous.) The inability to immobilize ribs actually answers part of your question: The lungs move the ribs in normal function. They don't need to be perfectly aligned to avoid stabbing the surfaces that they normally slide along. The bigger risk is knocking the healing rib out of position, and, again, the normal range of motion isn't a terrible risk for most fractures.  It hurts to breathe, so a recuperating soul will generally give their ribs as much opportunity to knit as they can. The fractured region will attempt to glue together. This begins rather fragile.  The ribs will build up a callous around the broken bits that will grow until the thing quits flexing over much. As this proceeds, the risk of the rib wandering off reduces.  This connecting lump eventually becomes bone and remodels like normal to reduce the bulk back down et viola. There actually   ways of immobilizing ribs, they just aren't worth it in most cases*. Surgery to go in and glue the pieces back together with wire and/or tapes is generally not actually needed, as you note. Why carve on a guy when a chest cast can do?

And unless we are talking about diabetes or leukemia, both of which would also show up when being tested at a doctor's office, these tests are not helpful in your scenario. Almost all other medical tests, like testing antibodies, hormones, vitamins, CRP, need specialized lab equipment and people with training.  There would be the possibility of taking blood and having it analyzed later. But while   (most doctor's offices I know only deliver to a lab once a day, storing the blood in a fridge before that), most people aren't trained at taking whole vials of blood,  and even people who are don't usually take their own blood.  The patient's best bet in this scenario is to have some doctor take the blood while the symptoms are occurring and send the sample to the lab. Doesn't necessarily have to be the treating specialist - one of mine is 70 kilometers away, so I have my blood tests done by my GP I can walk to.  As a bit of an aside, I have a hard time coming up with anything that would show up in the blood sample while showing symptoms, but fail to show up in one taken a few hours later after symptoms subside. Then again, I am not a doctor.	2016-01-02 12:33:24Z	YviDe	1

This is for healthy adults, sick people may need further restriction.  This means that ~15 grams of these wings would hit your daily sodium intake alone. Since you are probably consuming more than 2 g sodium daily even when you leave out the wings (2 g sodium is somewhat hard to get to even if you watch your intake), chances are that you need to cut out some intake source if you want to match the recommendation. The wings might be the easiest thing, as I doubt that any other food in your diet could reach 12% sodium.

The human body has several systems which are separated from each other such that fluids cannot freely move between them, and the pressure within each is maintained in a very precise manner.  Examples which come to mind are the cardiovascular system (which has variable pressure all the time, but it also varies in a strictly controlled way), the eye, the inner ear, and the brain ventricles and other parts of the nervous system which are bathed by the cerebrospinal fluid. Whenever the pressure of one of those is disregulated, the health consequences are severe:  ,  ,   or   respectively.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is an effective non-drug treatment for ADHD. Ask your psychologist about it.  ADHD is postulated to relate to a "deficiency" of two chemicals within a particular region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Stimulant medications such as Ritalin boost the levels of these chemicals to within a "normal range". This is why medication is so effective. Perhaps you would consider medication?

4246	4285	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4285	Both these schedules, ie., 3 meals a day and 6 meals a day, can work well for different type of people. Let’s look at the benefits of eating 3 meals a day first This schedule often works well for most of us in the long term as we are used to the breakfast-lunch-dinner that we eat at home. Mostly, people do not want to eat immediately upon waking up (generally it’s a couple of hours after waking up). More often than not, most of us do not feel like eating after breakfast till it is lunchtime. Three-meal schedule allows you to eat bigger meals and this is where six meals a day theory becomes a problem for those who love to eat big and are trying to lose weight. Six small meals will never make you feel that you have eaten enough; you might feel like you are just snacking and it makes you crave for more. So, three-meal schedule teaches you to take control of your hunger better whereas eating six times a day tends to make you eat more, as you end up eating every 2-3 hours irrespective of the fact that you are hungry or not.  Now, let’s look at the benefits of 6-meals-a-day schedule  It could be an ideal plan when you are required to a lot of calories to gain weight or if you are a sports person who burns a lot of calories. Also, it’s something you want to follow if you are someone who needs to consume high amounts of protein as our body can only assimilate and absorb between 30-40 grams of quality protein per meal. Therefore, this schedule is ideal for people who want to limit protein intake to about 15-40 grams per meal. Another benefit of 6-meal-a-day plan is when you are required to consume large amounts of carbs. It can also help you to maintain your sugar levels. For some, especially diabetics, it could be a tough ask to go on for more than 3-4 hours without eating anything and smaller frequent servings would work well to maintain stable energy/sugar levels.

4238	4261	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4261	tl;dr - No, not really. HIV is different. No, use what is best (or best assumption based upon symptoms, finding, etc.) for infection. 
You are asking several questions. 
TB is a very tough bacteria to treat taking many months of therapy for two main reasons: 
1. It replicates very slowly. Preventing replication is one major area where antibiotics are effective. Slow replications makes stopping this process take longer as it is difficult to completely break the chain to reproduction. 
2. It has the ability to encapsulate itself against the environment making it more difficult to get antimicrobials to penetrate and fight the infection. 
This is the simple explanation for why "hitting it" at every angle is the best mode of attack, especially in a situation where you have multi-drug resistance and are forced to use what would normally be "second line" agents. 
That being said, Successful eradication should lead to minimal additional drug resistance as all bacterial containing genes that allow for drug resistance to be wiped out and preventing them from being passed along to develop further resistances. 
HIV is treated with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) to attack the virus at various modes of replication   entry into the cells. Another example of hitting it at every angle. One strategy utilized in HAART is to use medications   for their drug interactions. Retrovir is utilized to increase the drug levels of other agents which allows for utilization of lower dosages. Lower doses = reduced side effects (typically). 
Lastly, with a generic infection, overkill is simply overkill. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics is considered better utilization of every possible antibiotic available. More medications means more side effects, increased risk of drug-drug interactions, and cost. Medicine typically follows the path of empiric (best estimation of pathogen and course of treatment for it), followed by a culture to determine exact pathogen, then specific treatment of that pathogen.	2016-01-01 16:02:45Z	JKA99	0

This overview from shows, that the deepest sleep stages 3 & 4 only happen during the first half of the night. The second half is mainly REM sleep. However our brain is highly active during al these cycles.  
Image source:  Because even at night there are noises and plently of stimulants for the brain, it needs a gatekeeper which decides which stimulant to get through. This is the job of the thalamus. So if you hear your alarm or if you don't depends wether the thalamus "decides" that it is an important noise and therfore should be recognized by the cortex ( , )
One example of that gatekeeper function are Mothers with newborn children. If their child does tiny noises they will wake up, no matter which sleep cycle they are in, because the thalamus recognizes the child as important. On the other hand cars which are passing by on the outside street, which are even louder that noises from the child will not wake up the mother.  To answer the question: most likley your alarm will not be as important to you as your newborn child, but if it's important for you to wake up with your alarm, you will even with 30% less noise, no matter of your sleep stage. However disorientation and headaches will not get less. Probably you are in a deeper sleep cycle when your alarm goes of, to change that you should alter the time you go to bed. A roughly estimate is, that you need 90 minutes to get one full cycle of sleep. So try to get 6:00 or   or 9:00 hours of sleep.

4232	4235	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4235	I presume you're taking the teleological view that symptoms are "good" and have a beneficial (if not fully understood) purpose, and therefore should not be messed with. That is a   (a belief based on a construct, not objective evidence). Taking your example, I would ask you, what beneficial purpose does a runny/stuffy nose serve? Does it facilitate viral removal? Is it necessary to full recovery from a cold? Is long-term immunity to a rhinovirus enhanced if no symptomatic treatment is rendered? First, let me clarify that symptoms are neither "good" nor "bad"; they merely   (although one can argue that   is a good thing.) Illness/disease/disorder is present. Thanks to them, now we know, and we can treat (or not treat) the underlying disorder. But the symptoms themselves are merely the body's reactions; they aren't necessarily  . Sometimes mild symptoms aren't treated, but the decision to treat is based on how disruptive (and/or dangerous) they are.  Let's assume only 'relatively benign' symptoms, for example a runny nose, sore throat and cough that typically results from infection with a rhinovirus (the most common cause of the common cold).  People treat a runny nose because it bothers them. It's hard to breathe easily with a runny nose, and the mere presence of nasal congestion causes a mild and very annoying feeling of air hunger in many people. Mouth-breathing dehydrates the oropharynx and upper airway, making a sore throat worse, worsens coughs, and makes sleep difficult, resulting in daytime drowsiness, irritability, etc. Overall, it's uncomfortable. The same applies to the sore throat: it makes eating, drinking, swallowing, and communication uncomfortable. Coughing (and sneezing) causes increased pain in sore throats, can keep people awake, spreads illness through  aerosolized droplets (making for awkward social interactions), etc. The benefit of   these symptoms is largely unknown;   of treating these symptoms (which supports the multi-billion dollar cold remedy industry) is that it just makes people feel better overall. They sleep better, cough less, feel less achey, swallow with less discomfort, etc. That's why people treat their cold symptoms.  Some of the deleterious effects of rhinovirus infection are known (production of chemokines by epithelial cells resulting in influx of leukocytes into the airway leading to airway pathology; release of inflammatory cell products from neutrophils, cationic protein release from eosinophils, reactive oxygen species, etc., which can cause tissue damage.) However,   is unknown. This means that unless and until benefits are shown of   symptoms, the   of treatment of the common cold is incompletely known. In that event, the practice will favor treatment. My hope in answering this question is to shed light on the potential harm of teleological arguments, that they need to be discarded in favor of objective evidence. Things are not true because one believes them to be true; to quote Philip K. Dick, "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."

4221	4225	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4225	Basically, the human (and that includes all ages) immune system has two parts: The infant's immune system really is capable of handling a lot more antigens than it is exposed to in a vaccine + its live environment at any one point in time. I suggest you read the review by Paul Offit, who is cited in the article you linked to, for more information on that,  . Basically, the specific immune response mediated by B- and T-cells can handle a specific immune response for a large number of antigens at once.  This number is largely   of what you are seeing in the child. The number of antigens the immune system can handle says nothing about what symptoms the immune response will cause, because the effects you can see is largely the innate immune response. Small children get a fever pretty often because most pathogens are new to them and the innate immune system responds to that with a fever. Exposure to several pathogens at once does not cause a higher fever.  With vaccines there is no actual risks of the child getting the disease. The vaccines contain   (the  , for example, is against the toxin, not the bacterium producing it). The adaptive immune system needs   in sufficient quantities, but it carries no risk of them suddenly developing measles or something like that. Unfortunately, we can't really tell the immune system we only need the antibodies, not the cytokines all the other parts that may let the child   sick when it really isn't. So the innate immune response happens and may appear to weaken the child and leads to parents to jumping to the conclusion that this is too much for such a small child. Nobody is saying a fever is fun for the infant/baby of course, but in essence, vaccination is a risk/benefits calculation.  One thing to keep in mind is that several of the vaccinations given in childhood are combination vaccines (MMR, DTP,..), and the immune response is still not in any way overwhelmed. And these are several vaccines for diseases that are actually dangerous (diphtheria, pertussis,...) given together. The resources don't get used up because different cells are doing different things and, even more, the B-cells that respond to the measles vaccines are not used for the immune response towards the rhinovirus the child is exposed to at the same time.  The number of antigens is used for that reason - it's a metric to show that the humoral immune response is really capable of doing a lot of stuff at once. It's just that many people see the fever vaccinations can cause and then conclude that a child is actually sick after a vaccination and therefore their immune system must be "weakened" (which, outside of actually immunocompromised people is another ill-defined concept) by the vaccine and incapable of dealing with other things at the same time. It isn't. That fever is the body unspecifically reacting to anything that warrants an immune reaction, because the specific and unspecific parts of it didn't evolve to be independent.  Also, nobody is saying anything about "straining" the immune system,  because "straining the immune system" does not have a defined meaning. What they are saying is that a child's immune system is more than equipped to deal with several things at once.  That delaying vaccinations for fear of overwhelming the immune system is unnecessary can be seen by what happens in  children who are already sick and receive a vaccine. The answer is "not much out of the ordinary". The innate immune response is launched already and the adaptive immune response can deal with everything at once.  The recommendation to delay vaccines when the child has a serious illness is not based on the child's immune system not being able to "handle" both, but on trying not to "mix" symptoms and avoiding adverse vaccination reactions on top of an illness.   - also a very good read.  The actual study behind that WSJ article is  , though that deals only with neurological outcomes and not infections.  As a general note on delayed schedules, there has been no evidence presented so far that delaying vaccines has any benefits whatsoever, for example less or less severe infections during childhood. Of course the vaccine schedule is not evidence-based down to the weeks where everything is given - of course parts of it could be delayed by two weeks, other parts could be given two weeks earlier, etc. Nobody is going to design 200 different schedules, enroll thousands of children in a study and test all possible schedules.  But what we have is definitely not overwhelming the immune system and for most children, it ensures that by the time the body encounters the actually infectious pathogens in the wild, the specific immune response to it is already in place and parents will never even notice their child was exposed. 	2015-12-29 09:21:25Z	YviDe	8

To be sure, you may want to wait a couple of days (2 or 3) and then take another test. If you are pregnant, then the line should become darker. One of the commons reasons for a faint line on a pregnancy test is because you could be very early in your pregnancy. Home pregnancy tests measure the amount of the hormone   (hCG), which increases during the first few weeks of pregnancy, in the urine. It is possible that you are testing too early and the amount of hCG in your urine is not high enough to produce a full dark line. This can change in a matter of days, though. It is also possible that you have miscalculated when your period was due and tested too soon. The pregnancy test itself could also cause a faint line. If your test has a low sensitivity, it would not pick up as low levels of hCG, and would return a faint line, rather than a dark one. You can usually check how sensitive the test is by checking the side of the box (note: a lower number is better). Your test could also have expired, causing it to not give accurate results. Some medications do cause false positives on pregnancy tests, but you can rule this out yourself if you aren't taking any medications that raise hCG levels. It is also possible that you could have gone through a chemical pregnancy, a form of very early miscarriage, which would still cause a rise in hCG levels. Still, you should take another test in a few days, preferably with a more sensitive brand, and if you are still unsure about your results, you can consult your doctor.	2015-12-27 04:34:54Z	michaelpri	5

Mineralocorticoid effects include Glucocorticoid effects include Both types of effects can occur in limited frequencies outside the kidney, generally in the gastrointestinal system. These effects can then lead to a variety of symptoms, including high blood pressure. Mineralocorticoids can cause chronic arterial hypertension through long-term sodium retention. Glucocorticoids can do the same, through several factors (the details of which are unknown): Vasodilation refers to the size of the capillaries; dilation of the capillaries decreases blood pressure, while the reverse increases blood pressure. This is perhaps the most direct effect of corticosteroids on hypertension and blood pressure.

Tonsillitis is usually caused by either a viral infection such as Herpes Simplex Virus, or a bacterial infection. Again, treatable and highly recommend seeking professional help.  Tonsils are a lymphatic organ, meaning it contains specialised immune cells that work together to identify invading pathogens and clear it.  Tonsillitis happens due to an inflammatory reaction towards an invading pathogen.  Some people have severe inflammation resulting in partial or complete blockage of their airway, thus being potentially life threatening. In these cases, the patient is recommended to undergo tonsillectomy - the removal of their tonsil.  If your tonsillitis is not life threatening (an just an inconvenience) it may not be necessary to remove it.  Again I would consult with your doctor, as there may be indications for removing it and contraindications as well that are specific to your medical history [4,5].	2015-12-25 23:26:21Z	pandoraEudora	5

Edema (and thus generalized fluid retention) can be divided into two categories: generalized edema and localized edema. The first occurs all over the body, while the second occurs in only certain parts of the body. There are various causes of fluid retention. Some include The specific cause can determine whether the edema is generalized or localized. To be even more general, fluid retention is caused by the swelling or increase in pressure of various cavities within the body, including capillaries, the lymphatic system, and the organs I mentioned before. This can eventually cause ruptures to occur, and fluid will leak out. This in turn will cause edema in various parts of the body - again depending on the cause. "Water weight" appears to be referring to the amount of this excess fluid building up outside of these body cavities. "Water retention" refers to the general phenomenon, while "edema" refers to the associated swelling. So yes, this is a well-documented phenomenon, although the term "water weight" isn't commonly used. A final note: As  , the term may simply be used often in a non-technical way, to refer to some of the weight that is quickly lost in some cases.	2015-12-31 15:35:25Z	HDE 226868	8
4173	4226	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4226	This answer is more speculative than I like my answers here to be, but I think it still has some value.  It is highly unlikely that a single six-day period of working the night shift will have a permanent negative effect.  The problem is, this can't really be proven, and that is twofold.  First, pretty much all studies on the subject are either done on long-term effects on people who are working like this for a long time (shift workers), or they are done on people temporarily exposed to this, and with no follow-up on permanent effects.  Examples for the first type: , a review on the effects of shift work on sleep   - study on whether obesity and metabolic syndrome is more prevalent in shift workers  Examples for the second type:   - study measuring the short-term effects of delayed sleep on gene expression. No conclusions can be drawn for the long-term effects.  And second, this kind of study is also not really feasible. A lot of people go through a short or even medium term period of delayed sleep or even sleep deprivation in their lives. Think of, for example, students studying for exams not sleeping enough for a week or two. Patients receiving medication with the side effect of insomnia. Parents not sleeping enough for weeks, months, or even years. Teenagers partying late for several days in a row.  Getting a control group for such a study would be hard to impossible - I'd go as far as suggesting that by the time someone is 40 or 50 years old (so that we could compare long-term effects), almost nobody would even qualify as a control group subject who had never experienced sleep deprivation or delayed sleep for more than two days or so.  There are long-term effects of long working hours (12 hours is long) and shift work, but that is really another question and six days is unlikely to cause any of them. 	2015-12-29 10:53:01Z	YviDe	1

The intensity of pain (as you have mentioned) is often left to the patient to describe on a scale of 1-10, or a visual analogue of faces.

Pain relief (both physical and emotional) is a significant part of medicine, yet we still have "pain scales" for self-reported pain, one of the more common ones being the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale: To try to accurately assess pain (which is still  ), a patient's scale should be interpreted by a caregiver using examples   (If the person has had severe kidney stones, for example, the examiner can use that as a "10".)  No, we don't expect a lot of 8/9/10s on the scale. We hope it will be used exactly as you have described: in many cases, 10 is described by a caregiver as "the worst pain you ever had." If the patient has never had severe pain before (kidney stones, childbirth [for most], etc.) the pain has to be imagined. Left to their own devices, a patient might look like a 6, but be reporting a 10. In this case, a nurse must try to ascertain their actual level of their pain. But still, it is their pain, and how it is felt differs from person to person, which is why no objective criteria can be assigned the pain scale.  	2015-12-26 19:34:21Z	YviDe	9

4169	5373	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5373	I'll give two perspectives: 1) human factors engineer and 2) chronic pain patient.  1) When trying to objectify a subjective item like pain, a common set of tasks are applied to level the field and serve as a reference against which to measure. A common scale is called the  . I have used it to quantify a pilot's ability to complete tasks like landing, hovering around an airport and turning. In the case of pain, neerajit mentions activities of daily living, and those would include dressing, urinating and having bowel movements, maintaining communications, having a stable mood, eating, drinking, etc. When assessing pain, a 4-6 might interfere with the ability to do the task even significantly, but it probably would not cause deterioration of the patient's health. These scales work much better for acute pain or how pain responds to treatment in an acute setting to treatment. For chronic pain, a scale is applied like this one,  , but it is applied more to how much the pain interferes with activities over say the previous two weeks overall. How does it affect overall quality of life, relationships, ability to work, walk, do housework, socialize, etc. This brings me to perspective #2. 2) Pain and experiencing the sensation of pain can be scary for someone who never experiences; the same can be true for the opposite. What I mean by that is people who are in pain and who experience it regularly do not necessarily know that their experience is different, and they learn to work within the experience of pain.  To measure my experience of being in pain and experience too strong of sensations, I had to have people point out to me that what I experience is not what everyone else experience. I do NOT experience it the same way. In my case, this awareness was realized because I felt so much frustration in the amount of effort it took in order to accomplish similar work compared to what I used to be able to do or as compared to my colleagues. This measure is also relative because it is only against a small subset.  Another measure that I use for my own pain is the amount of discomfort that I see my colleagues or even my own doctors in when they watch me in pain. I personally find this fascinating because most of the time, I am really just trying to get something done while pushing through. I can be just as distracting or more for them as it is for me.  These are my two different ways to attempt to objectify a very subjective experience. A good post-script attempt to this objectification would be to somehow quantify via black-white contrast the patient's pain experience through them drawing it. When I look at Pain Art, it tends to be very raw with high contrast, and the ultimate measure for a 10 on a 0-10 scale would be no drawing at all because the patient couldn't do it. That is my afterthought.	2016-04-07 01:31:14Z	Lilibete	0

If one has a hypoactive prefrontal cortex by use of some theoretical drug, that implies a loss of functioning, not increased efficiency.

Basically, in medicine everything is assumed to be unsafe until it is proven to be safe. You can consider what the potential problems with this procedure would be that would likely be looked at first before it could ever become accepted practice.

Since there may be other adverse health effects that a priori are hard to identify, the only way to know that a proposed treatment is safe and effective is to do clinical trials and publish the results in a scientific journal. This is the start of the process in which the proposed treatment can be evaluated in scientifically rigorous way. At the end of the process there will have been independent groups repeating such trials, review papers will have been published that have looked at all the results of this particular treatment and compared the results to other treatments. If the treatment has been found to be a viable treatment that can be used under certain circumstances, then there will be been guidelines for doctors about using this treatment that are based on such review articles. 	2015-12-22 18:43:52Z	Count Iblis	2
4125	5084	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5084	Your question can basically be extended to all studies related to statistics. In simple terms you are generally looking for a relationship (e.g. between an increased number of deaths and air pollution levels). Of course finding such a relationship ALONE doesn't tell you anything about cause and effect. Even if you are only looking at deaths from diseases known to be linked to air pollution, you have to come up with a way to show that these factors depend on each other - that they are correlated. Usually, you look at some sort of control group that will have almost all the exact same characteristics as the test group, except obviously for the one you actually care about. The more similar the two groups are, the better of course - ideally if you could find two identical cities, with identical people - with the only difference being the air pollution, then you could show a cause and effect easily. Since this will be very difficult to achieve, you instead have to use some   statistical methods to study correlation of your variables. You can start reading about those methods here:  So, as long as those studies you refer to follow common statistical procedures, which I will assume they did, then yes, you could staticstically show a relationship and argue that X-many more people died from an increased in air pollution. One of the studies in the link you provided is referring to a Research Letter in Nature (one of the most highly regarded scientific journals out there):  [Lelieveld et.al] are using a:  They are using a  They are focusing on and So, basically, they build a global model that will be able to correlate higher particle toxicity values with the number of deaths in different regions. They also talk about a sensitivity study, which will test if any change of specific variables may have extreme effects on their model. Of course it is just a   and not the reality, so the accuracy of their results will depend on the accuracy of this model, which is explained in more detail here:  Overall, this actually isn't so much of a direct study with X number of participants. Nobody actually collected health information from participants, but they are using previously generated information (from the World Health Organisation) on toxicity response the effects of air pollution onto a global level. I assume the WHO has collected thousands of samples and analysed clinical trial that do what I mentioned earlier - they study the effect of a particular change in your environment onto your health.

It  This sweating usually occurs on the underarms (axillary) or the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar).  There is also another type of classification for hyperhidrosis. Primary hyperhidrosis (more common) is excessive sweating not related to another medical condition or medication, while secondary hyperhidrosis   related to a medication or medical condition. Some other differences are that sweating from primary hyperhidrosis does not typically occur while sleeping and that primary hyperhidrosis onsets earlier than secondary hyperhidrosis.  If you don't have another medical condition or take any medications that may cause the sweating, then the condition you most likely have is primary palmoplantar hyperhidrosis. The cause of primary hyperhidrosis is mostly related to your genetics, rather than any external causes. Overactive sweat glands are the most common cause and hyperhidrosis is known to run in the family. What actually triggers the sweating to occur is much harder to pin down. Heat can be a trigger, as well as anxiety, but the sweating can occur randomly at nearly all times. Besides sweating, there are some other possible side effects of hyperhidrosis. One study  concluded that patients with hyperhidrosis were at an increased risk of skin infection. This can be dealt with by treating your hyperhidrosis, though.

Let me first briefly explain a few historical confusions regarding the nomenclature of prostatic disorders with particular attention to your ‘ ’, which may be called an almost extinct creature!  suggested a classification of prostatic disorders based on clinical and bacterial culture findings, and their classification had been widely used at least until 1995.   identified   as: In the traditional classification, non-bacterial prostatitis refers to a condition that presents with similar clinical features as chronic bacterial prostatitis, including pyuria, but except that the cultures of urine and expressed prostatic secretions are negative. Prostatodynia also presents with similar clinical features as chronic bacterial prostatitis but excluding pyuria, and the cultures are negative. It is important to note that prostatodynia is more a symptom than a condition itself.  As noted by  , the US   standardised the classification of prostatic disorders in 1995 by adding a disease entity as asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, and combining non-bacterial prostatitis and prostatodynia into an entity as chronic prostatitis/pelvic pain syndrome. Thus, the NIH classifications can be listed as: Congestive prostatitis is an outdated nomenclature for a constellation of mostly ill-defined urological and pain symptoms,  and a few signs; it had been a poorly understood entity for the most of its time in use. Congestive prostatitis is clinically characterised by urological symptoms, such as urinary frequency, dysuria, and strangury; and pain or discomfort in urogenital and anal areas, such as pain in the inguinal region radiating sometimes even to the testicles, burning in the urethra, and pressure in the perianal region ( ). It is not clear whether the patients experience an actual pain or just a discomfort. According to  , as mentioned by,  , many patients, without being asked, stress the fact that they do not experience actual pain, but rather a very unpleasant, disturbing feeling. Some of them cannot even sit comfortably. According to   and  as mentioned by  , over 50% of these patients also complain about sexual disorders, such as erection difficulties, or painful or premature ejaculation.  Poorly defined symptomatology and pathophysiology of congestive prostatitis, along with a host of associated psychological manifestations, either as aetiology or as sequelae, had tempted many to classify congestive prostatitis as a psychosomatic clinical condition in which urological examination may show an actual swelling of the prostate, but where neither bacteria in the expressed prostatic secretions nor any other organic disease can be found ( ;  ;  ). As mentioned initially, congestive prostatitis is an outdated name for the condition it refers to, and there had been a myriad of names used synonymously to the same condition, perhaps reflecting the poor understanding of the condition itself:   ( ;  ).  Considering the current understanding of the pathophysiology and aetiology that ranges from prostatic to extraprostatic causes, diverse nature of the symptomatology, therapeutic options available, and the need to facilitate research with a consistent nomenclature,  .   Terms such as congestive prostatitis, congested prostate, and prostate congestion  .  Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a clinical syndrome described based on urological symptoms and/or,  pain or discomfort. It is defined as chronic pelvic pain for at least three of the proceeding six months in the absence of other identifiable aetiologies. Inflammatory and non-inflammatory sub-classification is done on the presence or absence of inflammatory cells in expressed prostatic secretions, post-prostate massage urine, or seminal fluid ( ;  ). In this discussion, the name ‘ ’ will be used only for the sake of answering the original question. Let us now look into the queries that the original question asks about. As we have discussed above, ' ' is an outdated name for the vague disease entity it refers to, and the name should be and is avoided in current medical literature. The term congestive prostatitis itself signifies only a state or condition of the prostate rather than a distinct disease entity itself.  .  Although CP/CPPS still remains a poorly understood disease entity, as reflected by the many hypotheses of its cause, there have been tremendous improvements in its evaluation, diagnosis, and management ( ). The symptoms seem to have a multifactorial origin so it is very important, yet difficult, to exclude underlying diseases with similar symptoms. The identification of the origin of the symptoms is crucial for the effective management; therefore, various attempts have been made to formulate tools to facilitate the evaluation and diagnosis of CP/CPPS,  such as  ,  , and   ( ).  Because of the multifactorial origin of CP/CPPS, there are a number of therapeutic modalities for CP/CPPS. However,   However, many medications and other forms of treatment can help to alleviate the symptoms and make CP/CPPS more bearable. Over time, this condition may improve or stabilise on its own ( ). Few guidelines have been published based on clinical evidence to provide recommendations for the treatment, eg  ,  .  Although this answer is not intended for a detail discussion on each treatment option available, the overall treatment strategies can be outlined as follows: Alpha-blockers (eg tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, and silodosin), antibiotics (eg ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and ofloxacin), and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (eg finasteride)  are the most efficacious medications for CP/CPPS, provided with they are used judicially considering the nature of individual cases. Anti-inflammatory medication treatment, such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (eg celecoxib) and glucocorticoids (eg prednisolone), are generally given when pain is not controlled with initial therapy.  The clinical significance of pharmacological treatment for CP/CPPS has been questioned ( ;  ).   recommend the following based on the best clinical evidence: In some cases of refractory CP/CPPS, invasive surgical treatments such as prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transrectal high‐intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) of the prostate, and transurethral microwave thermotherapy have been used. The evidence on such invasive surgical management techniques is very limited.  Other non-pharmacological treatments such as repetitive prostatic massage, therapeutic ejaculation,  neuromodulation techniques ( ), and various phytotherapies, including pollen extracts, bioflavonoids and/or Serenoa repens (saw palmetto), have been reported as being successful in treating some cases of CP/CPPS.  Physical dysfunction, such as abnormal pelvic muscle spasm and muscle tenderness, is associated with some cases of CP/CPPS ( ;  ).     recommend the following based on the best clinical evidence:   CP/CPPS is associated with a host of psychological manifestations, either as aetiology or as sequelae. Accordingly, various psychological treatment modalities have been used to treat CP/CPPS. However, no evidence from randomised clinical trials or comparative studies is available to support the use of psychological treatment or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in these settings. When referring a patient for psychological treatment, it is important to reassure the patient that his condition is real and that his suffering is not imaginary. Psychological support is appropriate in helping the patient cope more effectively with his serious, real-life problem ( ).   recommend the following based on the best clinical evidence:   The benefits of frequent ejaculation and specific exercises have been discussed above. Sitz baths may provide partial relief from acute exacerbations. Perianal self-massage may also also offer some relief, but the reported success is anecdotal ( ;  ). Sedentary lifestyle is associated with severe pain in patients with CP/CPPS; therefore, the modification of such lifestyle is a potential target for treatment ( ). 	2017-12-15 17:18:40Z	Ludwig Wittgenstein	3

Lowered cortisol levels are the normal response to dexamethasone; if the level doesn't go down as much as it should, that can point to one of several conditions that cause Cushing's syndrome (see below). There are standard and overnight dexamethason tests, and high dose and low dose tests. In the standard test, measurements are done over three days - in the low dose test, 0.5 mg of dexamethasone are given every six hours from day 2 onward; in the high dose test, it's 2mg. In the overnight test, in the low dose variety, the patient is given 1mg of dexamethason, and in a high dose dexamethason test, the patient is given 8mg.  Both tests can determine whether the patient's cortisol release is abnormal. This is usually due to one of three conditions:  With the high dose test, it is possible to identify whether the problem is Cushing's disease, while the low dose test can't make that distinction.

It has also been shown to not cause degenerative joint disease in your hand joints in old age. However, cracking your knuckles does have some risks. One study from 1990,  showed that, while cracking your knuckles does not increase your risk of arthritis, it does impair your hand function. It was shown to lower grip strength and cause hand inflammation in habitual knuckle crackers. Acute injuries to ligaments in the knuckles as a result of cracking knuckles has also been recorded. There are no physical benefits to cracking your knuckles. It has been observed that there is a possibly perceived sense of therapeutic release when cracking your knuckles, which is most likely the reason that many people do it habitually. Though it is not incredibly dangerous, knuckle cracking is a habit that is probably best avoided.	2015-12-16 04:29:04Z	michaelpri	8

But here the focus is on weight loss and improved blood sugar levels, which are not relevant health indicators for people who are healthy to begin with. General arguments for a carb based low fat diet are given  .
The evidence for benefits w.r.t cardiovascular disease is presented  . The basic point made in these more general and less rigorous arguments is that a natural diet for humans is a plat based diet, all the fats in our diets should then come from the plants we eat. Oils are refined calories with low nutritional value, they should be avoided. We are genetically adapted to live on such a diet where the calories from fats will be of the order of 10%. If you then put this to the test, study populations who live on such a diet and consider the health of the population, the fraction of the population who are obese, suffer from diabetes, heart disease etc. then what you find is that these levels are not a factor 2 lower, not a factor 10 lower, but typically more than a factor 100 lower. Take e.g.  : Such results have been replicated in many other studies. Only a few small scale intervention studies have been done.

Of note is the study concerning paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen.  The study compared the adverse effects of 4 groups: They found "adverse events (signiﬁcant difference)" consisted of: And stated that the "paracetamol group was drowsier than other groups." Reference 1 states: "Combining [the two] analgesics may increase the incidence of adverse effects." A similar clinical trial was described in Reference 2. The paper found that adverse events were "numerically higher in the groups receiving combination tablets." From this it can concluded that the likelihood of experiencing adverse effects is increased by combination of the two analgesics. I could not find anything solid in regards to your last question. The increased likelihood of experiencing adverse effects may be due to the two agent's similar mechanism of action. Reference 3 states: "Due to their mechanisms of action, using paracetamol and ibuprofen together theoretically increases the risk of renal and hepatic toxicity."

Midday brushing, is not essential for most albeit, it's highly dependent on your dietary habits. The same rule applies: 20-30 minutes after eating or 10-20 minutes before eating. The time-rule is influenced/is-in-place to compensate for the time it takes for the normalization of the oral PH after food consumption ("after a meal"), and the latter being to ensure that the introduction of food stuffs and liquids will not diminish the concentration of the essential  , contained within toothpaste, on the tooth surface ("before a meal"). Not brushing after you eat, before you sleep on the nighttime, can be likened to having oral excrement... Whenever you eat/have a meal, our   ingest and metabolize the food particle left over, essentially feasting on whatever we consume. Like every other living organism, these oral bacteria excrete as they reap. However,   secondary excrement is highly   and can have some unwanted effects on your tooth enamel: gradually dissolving it and henceforth leading to the occurrence of tooth   (cavities). When you decide to "hit the hay" without brushing, considering you have eaten since, plaque may start to harden and hence,   on the surface of your teeth. It's important to know that, once calcification of the   on the tooth surface has began to occur, we (yourself), cannot remove it with a toothbrush nor with any amount of  ; it can only be removed by a    via a routine cleaning using specialist equipment. It doesn't just stop there! As plaque begins to build up, your immune system treats it as if it's an infection. Your immune system doing what it does best, triggers the release of in situ  , to trigger an immune response via lipid signalling. As opposed to a "positive" immune response, the healthy tissue that adhere the gums to the teeth to the gum surface are attacked and harmed (degenerated) causing it form periodontal pockets and cause  . Periodontal pockets, can predispose plaque formation and hence, foreign bacteria colonisation below the gum line - along the tooth  .

Albeit, a long-term presence of inflammation can predispose you to a worrying amount of tissue damage. For example, take the common flu: short-term inflammation is essential for cell signalling, to help route immune factors such as phagocytes, to the site of the harmful bacteria and hence, to ingest and destroy the foreign bacteria -- known as  ; helping to make you "healthier" again. However, long-term inflammation causes unwanted bodily "wear and tear", that has been found to   such as, Heart disease, Dementia and secondary Hearing loss.  - non of this will happen over the course of one night. But, if it becomes habitual (not brushing before you sleep -- or flossing), the probability of it happening will steeply increase!

4043	5644	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5644	I think it's worth mentioning, that the mattress you use should fit your sleeping position - as well as your cushion. The way you sleep (back, side, belly) influences the need for individual support or softness in the different areas of your body.
For example, people (esp. women) who sleep on their stomach and use a mattress that is too soft in the belly region, often experience backpain, because the lower back is in a hyper-lordothic position (sorry if the term is not correct, I'm not a native-speaker - I think hollow-back is also a word for it). Also those people shouldn't use a cushion, that is too high for the same reason.
So every sleeping position has special problems and individual needs. If your sleep is not relaxing, it impairs your quality of life. If you already experience pain, your body signals you to change something. As a physical therapist I'd recommend you to get informed in a local store, that sells mattresses and maybe is into health and fitness stuff. Furthermore you can start doing sports like yoga, pilates, muscle training (core stability) to further improve your health and prevent increasing pain.	2016-04-27 12:50:37Z	Sunny Onesotrue	0

As shown, "Very common" means equal to or greater than 10% [of the patients tested for that drug].  "Common" or "frequent" means more than 1% but less than 10%.  "Uncommon" or "infrequent" means between 1 per 1,000 and 1%.  Rare means equal to or more than 1 per 10,000 but less than 1 per 1,000.  Very rare means less than 1 per 10,000.  In turn, for any specific drugs the above metrics are derived, not by doctors, but by specialized clinical trials statisticians conducting clinical trials of such drugs.  Clinical trials are conducted by separating patients into at least two groups.  One control group just takes a placebo.  The test group takes the drug.  This type of study is sometimes called randomized double blind placebo control study.  This process is further described in this  .  You conduct the clinical trial for a certain period of time.  And, then you observe the frequencies of side effects using the semantic as described above. Granted, the statisticians deal with the actual precise numbers and are not satisfied by using narrative categories instead of calculations.   Next, the statisticians will compare the frequency of side effects between the Control group and the Test group.  And, they pay much attention where the Test group's side effects are much larger than for the Control group.  And, they measure whether that difference is real and not due to just randomness.  The latter (probability that occurence is just random) is captured in a probability called a p-value.  If that p-value is less than 0.05, the side effect is deemed to be statistically significant (and greater than for placebo). In the US, the mentioned clinical trials are submitted for assessment and drug approval or denial to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).  In Germany, such clinical trials are submitted to Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte  . If you are interested on the subject, the BfArM website has most probably some very interesting information.	2015-12-25 01:17:22Z	Sympa	6
4041	4195	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4195	To answer this question, I think it would be better to know how a drug gets into the market. There are a number of trials done on a drug before it is approved for general/commercial use. These are    and animal studies are done to evaluate the mechanism and efficacy of a specific drug while Phase 1, 2 and 3 trails determine (or rather estimate) the efficacy and adverse-effects of the drug in clinical trails done on real patients/volunteers with increasing sample size. 
  trails are the largest and usually the last trails before a drug is approved for routine clinical prescription. The sample size in these trails varies considerably depending upon the prevalence and nature of the disease for which the drug is being developed. For example, around 15000 children were included in phase 3 trails for the new vaccine currently under consideration against malaria. For diseases like cancer the sample size is likely to be smaller.
 Most of the time the sample size in these trails is inadequate to catch all the possible adverse effects of a drug. It will however, bring the common ones to light. To counteract the issue of relatively rare adverse effect, another kind of trail is in use, often called phase 4 or   in which the physicians report any hitherto unknown adverse effects of the drug to the regulation authorities after the drug has been approved for commercial use. If these adverse effects are deemed serious, the drug may be recalled from the market and banned from further use (as was the case with  , and several other drugs).

Here's a meta-study of other studies: As @JohnP says, doctor's office blood pressure is known to be a suboptimal test of hypertension. Its a single sample, and also it may show up higher (as in the case of the White Coat Effect), or lower (as in the case of Masked Hypertension) than normal. Better determinations of hypertension can made by either wearing an "ambulatory blood pressure" cuff for 24h, or by making many readings with a home BP monitor (in which case your must carefully follow the instructions, be sitting, rested and keep you arm at the correct height). Bear in mind however, that readings from ambulatory and home BP devices are not directly comparable to the same BP values seems in your doctor's office. Different values correspond to the same risk (lower BP values are generally used to determine hypertension when the readings are made out of the doctor's office). In the above image, "home" is the sitting self test, 24h is the "ambulatory" (while active) average, and nighttime and daytime are the averages of the ambulatory monitor when when asleep/awake. Its important to know there's generally (very!) large difference in risk between the same home and office readings. The fact that your BP returns to truly excellent levels may a good indicator in that your body is reacting appropriately to demands. That said, if you have prolonged high BP (due to stress or otherwise), you should be concerned.	2017-02-09 18:13:51Z	user48956	0

Certain other behaviors that were learned over time, and have become "automatic", might be difficult to change, but might be able to. Sometimes, they can be over-ridden by "learning" a different reaction (using similar scenarios). So for example, one might have an involuntary gag-reflex when they consume certain vegetables, but over time, lose sensitivity to those things. Although you asked about actions, there may be evidence that we can over time change both "automatic" actions and thoughts. "Automatic" is in quotes here because typically these are behaviors/thoughts that our brains have been trained to perform over a long period of time, and practiced so much that we basically due them by default, and one might argue involuntarily.  that many people have subconscious racism, but  Since our brains control actions through the motor-cortex, theoretically, there are some actions too which, if the associated neurons pass through your motor-cortex, then by constantly practicing and training your body through mimicking the situation, you may be able to consciously override the default reaction (more easily over time).	2018-02-25 08:52:35Z	Dave Liu	3

That said, the NCI does note that some cancers occur more often in younger age groups, citing bone cancers (where the most at-risk age group is adolescents under 20) and leukemias. The NCI also provides a bar graph showing the percentage of new cancers in various age groups, broken down mostly in ten-year increments: This would seem to indicate that your cancer risk goes down after about the age of 70. However, this is clearly misleading, because fewer and fewer people survive to reach these higher age groups. Thus, with fewer people in that group alive, there is going to be a significant drop in the percentage of cancers that occur in that group.  exist, which show the chance of developing cancer within a certain amount of time at a given age (data from 2010-2012). Table 2.12 in the linked document shows that the chances of developing cancer within 10, 20, or 30 years increases with age (although long-term data is not available for the higher age groups, as most people at the age of 80 do not live for 20 or 30 more years. An interesting effect, though, is that the chance of ever developing cancer does change, increasing by small - negligible, even - amounts from the age of 0-30, and decreasing by the same small amounts from there, until there is a sharp drop-off at the age of 60. The table shows that if, for example, you're 70 years old, then you're less likely to get cancer during the rest of your life than someone 40 years old. The reason for this, of course, is more morbid: other diseases that are more common or more deadly in old age will set in at older ages. Less time to live implies less time to develop cancer. To make this less confusing, at younger ages, your risk of developing cancer within a small amount of time - your instantaneous risk - steadily increases. At ages past 30, however, your risk of developing cancer throughout the rest of your life steadily decreases. I would assume that your question is better answered by the first statistic, rather than the second.	2016-01-16 16:30:47Z	Fermi paradox	2

MRI is usefull to determine the phenotype of someones crohn's (e.g. localized terminal ileitis, perianal disease).  An MRI of course is not suitable as sole instrument to establish a crohn's disease diagnosis. In my case diagnosis was established by ileocolonoscopy, examination of the biopsies collected thereby by a phatologist, stool markers and full blood count. MRI was used as additional diagnosis instrument since ileoscopy raised the gastrologists strong suspicion of a crohn's, the phatologist examination of the biopsies was inconclusive. Blood count showed the typical crohn's associated malnutrition signs and all the signs of an immune system actively fighting an inflammation. In addition a bacterology of the stool sample showed no evidence of yersinia enteritis.  The ecco guidelines thoroughly describe the establishment of a crohn's diagnosis

4003	5872	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5872	The first line of investigation for diagnosis of Crohn's disease is endoscopy (gastroduodenoscopy and ileocolonoscopy). Endoscopic remission (healing of mucosal lesions) does not necessarily correlate with clinical remission (disappearance of symptoms), and endoscopy would therefore still be indicated as a first-line diagnostic test if there is a very high suspicion for the disease based on previous symptoms.  For example, take a 21 year old man of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, with two sisters having Crohn's disease, who has a resolved history of bloody diarrhea 1 year ago, and is found to be anemic and B12 deficient on blood tests. This patient would warrant endoscopy even if asymptomatic at the time of presentation. As the other answer notes, fecal markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin) and serologic markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP) could be used. In this situation, their utility would be as a "rule out" test if the suspicion for the disease is rather low and the goal is to avoid having to perform an endoscopy. If those markers are negative, and there are no symptoms, it may be appropriate to defer performing endoscopy until symptoms re-appear. Finally, capsule enteroscopy, CT enterography and MRI enterography are non-invasive tests that can be used to evaluate the small bowel, which may show mucosal disease despite the absence of symptoms. CT and MRI can also delineate other complications of Crohn's disease such as fistula, abscess, or bowel perforation, though these would definitely present with symptoms.

Keeping the food warm for several hours would further destroy some nutrients but to a lower extent. The only essential nutrients that can be partially destroyed (30-50%) by heating are vitamins (mainly B vitamins and vitamin C) ( ). Minerals are not destroyed, but some of them can leak out of foods during cooking in water. Carbohydrates, proteins and fats can change during heating but are not "destroyed" in the nutritional sense. On the linked website, there is a table that shows how food processing (freezing, drying, cooking, draining and reheating) affects vitamins.

There is a lengthy article on this up on the blog "Science-based Medicine" called   . That article is quite good, but uses strong language, so it isn't for everyone. It describes the rhetoric around MMS, especially in regards to how it's used on autistic children.  First of all, what is MMS? It's diluted sodium chlorite, a bleach. And the person who sells it   it basically cures anything.  That alone should be enough to make anyone skeptical. The flu is a viral infectious disease of the respiratory tract. Rheumatoid arthritis is an incurable autoimmune disease. Appendicitis is an inflammation of the bowel. These are wildly different things, and that's not counting the "hundred other diseases". The two probably most potent medicines we have, antibiotics and steroids, don't even claim to be effective for all of these.  As a bleach, MMS can cause serious complications. The Food and Drug Administration in the United States  The government agency "Health Canada"  Does MMS cure autism? Science doesn't usually say "we are 100 percent sure this doesn't happen". But in this case, it's probably pretty close.  All that the belief is based on are anecdotes, there are no scientific studies on this at all. There is also no proposed - MMS is a disinfectant, but autism isn't caused by an infection.  Autism doesn't stay constant. For example, there is a question here on Health.SE about autism and fever -  .  . From high-functioning individuals to people who need constant caregiving. There are no cures.

As far as I'm aware it's ineffective after the age of 5 because the parts of the brain that it's meant to train will have been pruned by the normal synaptic pruning mechanism, making it much harder for the child to develop the social skills as there's no longer a part of the brain that's 'primed' to handle that task.	2016-02-05 15:38:56Z	squigbobble	1

For each chromosome that isn't a sex chromosome, we get one copy from each parent, so we have two copies of every gene. The "autosomal recessive pattern" means that the condition is not linked to the sex chromosomes (autosomal) and only occurs in people who have two copies (recessive), one from each parent.  The parents, as carriers, themselves don't have any symptoms because they have a "healthy" copy of the gene in addition to the mutated gene. In a combination such as that, the risk of a subsequent child showing the syndrome is 25 percent, inheriting the mutation from both parents. 25 percent of children will get two "healthy" copies, and 50 percent will get one healthy and one mutated copies, and thus be carriers themselves.

You mention that your child has been drinking formula so far, so the switch to cow milk makes sense. Milk is an excellent source of calcium, which kids need a lot of to promote growth. In many countries, it is also fortified with vitamin D, which enhances calcium absorption.  The   recommends two or three servings (cups = approximately 600 milliliters in total) per day, to get around 700 milligrams of calcium. Except for fortified foods,  Can it be replaced? Sure. There's children who are lactose tolerant or get eczema, for example, who can't have milk. Should you, with no physical reason to? I'd say no. For one thing, getting enough calcium without dairy really isn't all that easy, especially for a one year old. Two cups of milk are much easier to get into a toddler than 350 grams of broccoli.  Also, for the purpose of reducing carbohydrates, reducing milk intake is a weird choice. That 600 milliliters of milk has about 30 grams of lactose (the only carbohydrate in milk). That 350 grams of broccoli to replace it has about 25. Complex carbs instead of a disaccaride, but if you are concerned about carbohydrates, milk is just really not a bad choice anyway.  I don't think anyone would tell you to give your daughter pasta, rice, and nothing else. A child's diet should be balanced, so of course she can have lots of other things - vegetables, meat, etc. Without knowing what exactly you mean with a diet low in carbohydrates, it's hard to say for sure, though.  Someone else already linked to the study  . The important part here is that this occurred even despite the children receiving calcium and vitamin D supplements and reducing their medication.  Most studies are of course done in kids with epilepsy - deviating from the recommended diet for children in such an extreme way is only done in studies where the benefits may outweigh the risks. Everything else is not defendable in front of an ethics committee.  However, in these studies, epileptic children on such a diet are compared to epileptic children on a normal diet. Differences between the groups are thus attributed to the diet.  Other problems associated with ketogenic diets in children are  .  Even in epileptic children, the ketogenic diet, despite its success, is only recommended   and includes regular checkups with a medical professional.  I think it helps to remember what ketogenesis   - fatty acid breakdown it order to get the body the energy it needs. That breakdown can lower the pH in the blood, leading to keto acidosis, which is dangerous. In a child, with a low body mass and a high energy need because of growth, this at least sounds very dangerous.   In summary,   do this unless necessary. There is potentially no benefit at all, and a risk a parent should not be take on without medical need and supervision. 	2015-12-04 17:19:06Z	YviDe	8

For children a balanced diet is important both for their physical and mental development. This means that malnutrition can cause permanent damage to both the mental and physical health of children.
See for example   describing cognitive and physical retardation as a results of protein malnutrition in children. In contrast, the effects of malnutrition in adults are much less severe and more easily reversed. A ketogenic diet puts particular stress on the neural development (and the brain as a whole), because neurons mainly metabolise glucose. Quoting  : The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose. This is also the reason why a ketogenic diet is used to treat some forms of epilepsy, because there the energy deprivation helps reduce the chance of the neurons firing too much and causing a seizure.
The effect of a ketogenic diet is again particularly strong in children because they use up to 40% of their total energy for the brain, while an adult uses only 20% of their energy for the brain.  Finally, it is simply impossible to properly compensate for a one-sided diet with food supplements. Very often, the uptake of a mineral or vitamin critically depends on the food that we eat together with the nutrient. Evolution has simply not prepared us for the uptake of pure nutrients in the form of pills! Examples where we know these relationships are:	2015-12-04 16:14:53Z	Thawn	6

That’s because the pressure of a flatus must go somewhere. If not expelled, the gas can blow up the intestinal wall, creating pockets called diverticula. When these pockets get infected, a painful and life-threatening condition called diverticulitis can result. Because of fart phobia, diverticular disease is a major problem in our society.

Low cholesterol can be found in some rare genetic diseases, and in people affected by other illnesses. For example, hyperthyroidism will cause low cholesterol because it fastens the metabolism and increases the use of lipids in general. Any illness that involves inflammation will be likely to lower the cholesterol blood level as well.  People affected by metabolic disorders and who have to follow a strict diet (especially hypoprotidic ones, like phenylcetonuria) will often have low cholesterol. Additionally, children often have low cholesterol because cells use cholesterol to expand and multiply, and the growth period therefore use a lot of cholesterol. As for the risks associated with low cholesterol, there is still little research on the subject. Low cholesterol seem to be a bad prognosis factor for severely ill patients, and associated with stroke, infections or mental illnesses. However, it is unclear if the cholesterol level is just a marker of the risk (a consequence) or a cause. Like all biological factors, it'd be probably interesting to do another test to see if this low cholesterol happened just once or if it's a trend. Since you're being treated for cellulitis, it's likely that this infection is responsible for your current low cholesterol (which would be confirmed if your cholesterol returns to normal after treatment).  Sadly I can't be more precise than this answer as there is, as far as I know, no specific study on cholesterol levels in people treated for cellulitis. Sources:	2015-11-26 09:17:09Z	Denn	4

Thus, if drinking a lot, don't do anything else that damages the liver, like taking medication that can itself lead to liver damage. The most common drug that this includes is acetaminophen (paracetamol).  The next important thing is to get the alcohol to be delivered into the blood (and liver) slowly. That means eating before drinking, drinking slowly, and not taking any medication that worsens the effect of alcohol.  And then comes reducing its effects and speeding up recovery. Drink enough additional fluids (water, juices, etc) before, during and after drinking alcohol. Get enough sleep and give your body time to recover.  With regular alcohol consumption comes vitamin deficiencies. A multivitamin with folate, vitamin B6, thiamine, and vitamin A might help. Iron deficiency and anemia are common, getting enough iron in the diet or through a multivitamin can help with that.  There are lots of things long-term alcohol abuse can cause that can't be treated like this, though.

In light of the evidence for weak esophageal sphincters being the cause for GERD, I'd consider low stomach acid being a cause an unlikely hypothesis.  +++ In regards to your edit, here is my main disagreement / concern  Food doesn't rot in the stomach. Food stays in the stomach  , which we know because we can track it. It spends most of its time in the colon. Food doesn't begin rotting within six hours, especially not while in the stomach, where, even in people with low stomach acidity, the acid kills most bacteria that could make the food rot.  What really makes me doubt this, though, is that there are people who don't produce, or produce very low levels of stomach acid. That condition is called   and is defined as  Normal values are between 1 and 3. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, this is a big difference.  The symptoms seen even in these patients do not  .  It is very hard to even try to refute those sources, as they regularly state such things as  without any citation. Or that rheumatoid arthritis is caused by poor digestion. Or that food used to include "digestive enzymes", but doesn't anymore. These are signs of pseudoscience and does not make me confident that anything else on that site is scientifically sound.  First of all, that source is about gastritis, not acid reflux. It says nothing about rotting food. It's about the complete opposite - how gastritis (and ulcers) needs to be treated by lowering the stomach pH so the stomach lining can heal. After that, proton pump inhibitors are discontinued and the stomach acid returns to normal levels. The inflammation of the stomach in gastritis (usually caused by taking NSAIDs) does not somehow cause a lower stomach acidity, which seems to be what you are implying.  There is a longer refutation of some claims here:  . That article includes several links to studies that show patients with GERD not having significantly lower stomach acidity than patients without GERD and that artifically lowering stomach acidity triggered more severe GERD symptoms. I am not sure how unbiased it is, but I highly recommend looking at it and  .  Another interesting paper is  , which concluded that in  people treated with PPIs (and thus lowered stomach acidity), food stays in the digestive tract for a shorter, not longer, duration.  A final recommendation: If you, yourself, are concerned about this, get your stomach pH tested. That's something that can be done.  Well, evaluating new hypotheses is outside the scope of this site. I have given you the state of research as I understand it and have tried looking at the references you presented, but found them severely lacking.

3777	3794	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3794	(This answer is related to my answer on   on the Biology SE)  First of all: When it comes to evolution, Biology doesn't talk of 'strong' and 'weak' , it talks of 'fitness' ("survival of the fittest", for example), which is about how well adapted to their environment an organism is. Fitness includes how well it can survive in its environment and how much it can produce vital offspring.  This is a misunderstanding of evolution. The wild type of a species is not the fittest this organism can be. That it is the wild type just means that it evolved and spread. Something that doesn't evolve can't spread (as an hyperbolic example, it might be advantageous for humans to have wings, but since we didn't evolve it, our wild type doesn't include it).  It also helps to remember that "the wild type" is not a uniform thing. There are many genetic variations which we still consider to be the wild type. Even bacteria that reproduce through asexual reproduction are not all the same, even within one host.  In the natural environment of the bacteria you are talking about, an antibiotic resistance confers little benefit because they don't encounter it. So if it evolves, it won't help these organisms survive and would only spread throughout the population by chance. On the contrary, it might even confer a disadvantage - for example, penicillin resistance required producing the protein beta-lactamase. In a penicillin free environment, this might just be a costly extra without a benefit. Over time, it might get lost.  In a human taking antibiotics, however, these bacteria with an antibiotic resistance are indeed fitter and have a survival advantage. Bacteria with multiple resistances even more so. Between bacteria, these resistances can actually be transferred by something called "transformation" that involves actually picking up genetic material, so evolving multiple resistances also isn't as uncommon as it may seem.  As for your virus example, without knowing more, I'd guess that the fitness reduction in the more resistant virus strain is probably a side effect of the resistance. Getting more or less fit through evolving resistance to treatment is not, in itself, a difference between viruses and bacteria. 	2015-11-21 06:35:55Z	Community	2

Even if you have IV fluids at your disposal, there is debate among trauma surgeons about giving fluids to a patient with abdominal trauma showing signs of blood loss.

Usually people are exposed to HSV - the virus that causes cold sores - as children; in that case, little ulcers in the mouth and on the skin around the mouth are common. In adults exposed to HSV for the first time, the throat is more commonly affected, but lesions can be anywhere. It is interesting that you mention chicken pox-like lesions on your face, because chicken pox is also caused by a virus in the same family, Herpes Varicella virus. Your doctor might do cultures for HSV - which will ultimately go away - and at least you will have an answer. At this point, anti-virals would be ineffective. Another virus - also in the Herpesvirus family - which causes prolonged throat ulcers/lesions is the virus that caused Infectious Mononucleosis (in this case the virus is called  .

I guess I was trying to reassure you that this, too, shall pass soon enough, and no further treatment would necessarily help. However, to answer your question: The following assumes no allergies, that you are a youngish adult in excellent health generally.  Maalox and Benadryl does help temporarily. Alternatives are lidocaine to gargle and  , or Cepacol (can be sprayed or can be slowly released in lozenge form). Do not use in combination or in excess. These medications are meant to give you enough relief to eat and stay hydrated. Gargling with cool water or warm salt water (1 tsp salt in 2 cups warm water) may help, as might eating cold foods. But these things will be temporary, and as long as there is deeper tissue inflammation, it will still hurt to swallow.  You will probably get more significant relief with  a systemic medication, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, For some, acetaminophen works better, for others, ibuprophen. Recently some doctors have recommend that you can take acetaminophen and ibuprofen at the same time because this has been shown to be as more effective at pain relief than either one alone. However, any drug should be taken only when the benefit outweighs the risk, and that applies much more so with combination drugs. All the usual precautions apply as well.  Note that some drugs are best avoided in some illnesses.

3733	3744	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3744	There are very few (but there   some) medications that need to be taken at very strict time intervals; early drugs for AIDS needed to be taken even in the middle of the night. No one expects   to mean, literally, every 6 hours on the minute. The dose is calculated to cover that period of rest (sleep). To understand this, you need to understand steady state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. After a certain number of doses, a drug builds up in the body   - meaning it stays more or less in the same concentration in the blood between doses, or to put it another way, the amount being taken in and the amount being eliminated by the body are about equal. It's not guesswork; researchers study the drug before it's even released to determine such things (see the second reference.) Pharmacokinetic studies determine the dosages at which the concentration of a particular drug/antibiotic is always high enough between doses such that serum levels don't fall below effective levels. Say a drug under investigation is given every 12 hours. Blood is drawn at frequent intervals over a number of doses for to determine peak levels (the time at which the concentration in the blood is highest) and trough levels (the time when the drug is the lowest.) If at the trough level the drug is below that needed to be effective, the dosing interval decreases: the subject must take it more frequently, say every 8 hours. This cycle continues until the ideal dosage and dose interval is established. The final recommendation takes into account how long you can go without taking the drug and still have enough drug - how to take the drug such that the steady state is maintained - if you sleep. If a drug falls below the effective dose quickly (say it is metabolized into an ineffective product), and a satisfactory prolonged serum level can't be arrived at, the prescribing physician will alert you to the fact that you   take it to as close to how it's prescribed as possible, and will tell you what to do if you miss a dose. When the timing of administration of life-saving drugs is  , it's not uncommon to hospitalize a patient to assure such administration. That has all been calculated so that there is adequate and continuous coverage. The bacteria have no opportunity to "develop resistance" while you sleep.

The third tier alarms will be quite quiet and usually reflect a problem with monitoring (ie lead fallen off). The second tier are usually low-moderate volume and persistent. This would indicate an abnormal value that the patient condition has changed and needs attention. The first tier alarms are critical changes that are life-threatening and require immediate attention. This first tier alarm is heard by all staff in the unit and can prompt other staff that there may be a need for assistance with that patient. Further to this is the code alarm. This is activated by the nurse and indicates that assistance IS required. I'm sure that not having adequate response to a cardiac arrest has more deleterious outcomes than loud alarms.	2016-02-02 23:58:28Z	Daniel N	1

This is essentially the same exact movement you would make when crossing your eyes. Our eyes are designed to be able to move up, down, left, and right, and, while it may not seem like the most natural eye movement, crossing your eyes voluntarily is completely normal. There is a potential for temporary disorientation, pain, or possible blurring if you cross your eyes for too long, but it would only last a short amount of time.

But, this is a really unhealthy use of those medications.  You most probably will eventually crash (as you would say) because you have to.  This is your body's way of recovering from the damage you are imparting on it by skipping sleep.  It is clearly not a sustainable effort.  Human beings do need sleep for body repair, cognitive function and learning (yes sleep plays a key role in encoding information you have learned during the day). I am not sure the long term effect of taking ADHD drugs for adults regarding impact on sleep has been studied.  This is probably because ADHD drugs are typically not aimed at adults to begin with, but to treat children with ADHD.  There has been some studies regarding ADHD children (medicated and unmedicated) and their respective sleep patterns vs control groups.  And, the results are not entirely conclusive as expressed in this one  .   The above, nevertheless, should not give one any comfort that using such ADHD drugs over the long term as adults to reduce chronically sleep requirement is safe. That's for a simple reason, attempting to reduce one's sleep requirement is downright unhealthy and dangerous by itself.   However, human beings differ.  A rare minority of the population (1% or 2% of the general population) are called "short sleepers."  These fairly extraordinary individuals can fare very well with much less sleep than the rest of us (probably half the requirement or close to 3 or 4 hours a night instead of the regular 7-8 hours).

Based on a review of scientific studies and other literature, it contains detailed recommendations for establishing blood donation programs, including which donors to accept or reject. It mentions several autoimmune diseases. From the non-communicable section (page 49), we have The specific reason for rejection here is twofold: The possibility of bleeding and of a secondary, more serious condition. The first risk, however, is common for all haematological disease. The section references a selection of guidelines from the UK Blood Transfusion & Tissue Transplantation Services. There is a full section dedicated to "Immunological diseases" (which presumably encompasses autoimmune diseases) (page 57): Note that the recommendation stems mostly from the assumption that these diseases are severe, and could thus cause serious harm to the recipients of these donors' blood. The referenced sources are three studies on the potential transferability of  , and one general set of blood donor recommendations. A later section discusses general central nervous system diseases (page 58): It is recommended that almost all donors with central nervous system diseases (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, etc.) be deferred, for several reasons: Some of these have not yet been supported by studies, although attempts have been made to prove/disprove them. The primary concern is that some variants of these diseases are not well-known enough, and there could be adverse effects that physicians are not aware of. This is a concern I've seen cited on various websites of blood donation programs. Finally, there is a generic section on medications (page 64). This harkens back to the deferral of some donors with thrombocytopenia, insofar as currently having the disease can make one ineligible for donation. In these cases, the medication could be transferred through the blood, thus possible harming the recipient: Again, though this possibility has been studied, there is little evidence to back it up. Blood donation programs are advised to defer these potential donors in some cases out of caution. There are   autoimmune diseases which will not automatically prohibit blood donation. Among these are asthma and some cases of rheumatoid arthritis and hypothyroidism. These are the less severe autoimmune diseases, and they are also well-known and treatable, meaning that some of the risks mentioned earlier don't apply to them.	2015-11-29 15:49:29Z	HDE 226868	11

This condition is most commonly seen in either young persons due to bicuspid aortic valve or in elderly with sclerotic aortic valves. In developing countries, it may occur due to rheumatic heart disease also.  When a normal person exercises, extra blood flow is needed in the muscles. Hence, heart starts pumping more blood to keep up with this increased demand of the body. However, in persons with aortic stenosis, orifice of the outlet of the heart is small and fixed. Hence, blood flow (cardiac output) cannot increase when person exercises. Due to blood vessel dilatation in muscles, blood goes preferentially to muscles and flow to the brain gets reduced. Hence giddiness or dizziness occurs. It can progress to syncope, i.e. transient unconsciousness and fall. 	2015-11-08 04:59:24Z	rncardio	4

3634	3643	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3643	The answer at the moment seems to be a clear "maybe".  There is a Cochrane review of this very topic.  .  A Cochrane review is a study where people collect a lot of other studies on the subject, determine whether the studies were well-designed, and, if they were, review those studies and draw a conclusion from that. These reviews get updated as new data becomes available. They are generally considered to be of high quality.  The Cochrane review includes a section titled "Plain language summary", which is very helpful for those not familiar with scientific studies - also the review is quite long, so it's good to have a summary of the important points. I'll include a summary here nonetheless.  In the Cochrane, the author looked at studies of women taking combination contraceptives for more than three months that included data on weight gain. The current conclusion of the review (last updated January 2014) is  This means that they found few studies that compared women taking combination contraceptives to women taking a placebo or nothing. This makes sense because contraception is usually taken for, well, contraception, and giving women a placebo instead is often unethical. Those four trials did not find a relationship between contraception use and weight gain. However, the four trials also only included five oral contraceptives and the skin patch, not a very wide variety of contraception. Most other studies compared oral combination contraceptives with other oral combination contraceptives or other methods of birth control (like the vaginal ring).  Basically, this means that the weight gains in these studies were so low that if a causation existed between taking contraceptives and gaining weight, the studies should have shown a more severe effect than they did. And even if   association existed, they would have expected more false positives than what was found.  Unfortunately, ultimatively the quality of the available studies is just too low to give a definitive answer at the moment: An interesting side note is that most studies only consider weight gain as anything over 2 kilograms or five pounds, which is a bit more than the weight gain described in the question. 	2015-11-06 17:08:17Z	YviDe	5

It's called apthous stomatitis, affects at least 20% of the population, and its natural course is one of eventual remission. By far, most people with apthous stomatitis are otherwise healthy.  However, when someone presents with recurrent mouth ulcers, one should always inquire especially about the opthalmic, genitourinary and gastrointestinal health of these patients, because (ignoring the first two organ systems)  Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): (most common) caused by (?) bowel wall muscle dysfunction
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): caused by structural damage to the intestinal mucosa that impairs absorption and stimulates secretion 
Malabsorption syndromes: carbohydrate, bile acid, etc. 
Chronic infection: C. diff, giardiasis, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, parasites, etc. 
Celiac Disease (wheat/barley/rye protein-induced autoimmune disease) 
Endocrine diarrhea: from hyperthyroidism, Addison's disease, gastrinoma, etc. 
Idiopathic Secretory Diarrhea In IBS and IBD, the patient   has crampy, intermittent abdominal pain relieved with bowel movements. In IBD and Celiac Disease, stool often occult heme+.   Malabsorption (eg, lactose malabsorption) and maldigestion (eg, pancreatic insufficiency)is   associated with onset of diarrhea soon after eating and/or  . I assume your doctors have already looked for Crohn's (it appears they've looked for signs of Ulcerative Colitis as well.) Endoscopy and colonoscopy may both miss Crohn's, however, because - unlike UC - Crohn's can skip around in the small intestines; though it is most common in the ilium (the terminal portion of the small bowel) and the proximal colon, it can cause ulceration anywhere from the mouth to the rectum. It can come and go with remissions lasting for years, and, interestingly, Crohn's is often accompanied by abdominal pain and feelings of low energy and fatigue, as well as possible weight loss and malnutrition. Celiac Disease can present in a mild form with only unexplained iron deficiency anemia (from malabsorption) to chronic diarrhea with fatigue and weight loss. Also interestingly, Crohn's responds to anti-inflammatory drugs, though the wrench in this scenario is that NSAIDs usually make it worse, not better. Inflammatory Bowel Disease is a difficult problem, but there are effective treatments for Crohn's. Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a common cause of episodiic diarrhea (sometimes alternating with constipation). IBS can come and go as well. There are new tests for Crohn's (e.g. fecal biomarkers) and IBS. If by no food allergies you mean you've had skin testing, then true food allergies have likely not been ruled out, as skin testing is not reliable.  Celiac Disease is diagnosed best by positive serology, positive small bowel biopsy   a favorable clinical response to a diet eliminating wheat gluten/gliadin (and perhaps barley and rye as well.)  What can someone with persistent symptoms without a diagnosis do? First, they can try an elimination diet. A person can do that without seeing a doctor. Also keep a food diary. That's always a good idea with any gastrointestinal problems. They might talk to their gastroenterologist about different trials. Since you have no definitive diagnosis, a "step-up" approach seems more prudent.

It's better to do a TFT/Coeliac/HIV test early to avoid unnecessary tests. Age would be useful. I did a gastroenterology job as a Junior Doctor and we had a few cases of chronic diarrhoea where most investigations are normal.
Often  it was just overflow diarrhoea (i.e constipation is the primary problem)
We also diagnosed a few patients with microscopic colitis (only visible on colonic biopsies)- which are thought to be caused by NSAIDS and got better on stopping.
So the timing of the NSAIDS may be coincidental - unless the symptoms recur and again responds to NSAIDS. Eventually, we might test for Pancreatic insufficiency (fecal elastase) and test for bile acid malabsorption.

One often overlooked cause of acid reflux is   acid production in the stomach rather than excess.  Sometimes this is caused by malnutrition and sometimes by other imbalances in your intestinal floral.  In either case, PPI's would do you no good because what your body really needs is support in acid production rather than suppression of acid production. If you want to test this possibility, try taking some Betaine HCl (I found mine on Amazon).  The results could be painful if you weren't lacking stomach acid in the first place, since now you have even more acid to deal with, but it's a quick way to test/rule out this possibility. It's also possible your LES just needs time to retain its ability to contract and close itself in order to prevent reflux.  For that I recommend some self massage around the abdomen. I myself never had great success with PPI's and reflux, since my body would just adjust to the inhibitors and produce more acid than before, thereby negating the intended effect.

Just through rehabilitation, you can totally recover from a torn ACL.  In a clinical trial done in 2010,  two different treatment strategies were given to 121 young, active adults (ages 18-35) who suffered acute ACL injuries. One strategy was rehabilitation with early ACL reconstruction surgery. Most people given this treatment strategy opted for the early surgery (61 out 62). The other strategy was rehabilitation with delayed ACL reconstruction surgery. Of the 59 people treated with this strategy, only 26 people opted to get surgery. The other 36 were healed with just rehabilitation.  Though that trial was meant to find the most effective treatment of torn ACLs, it did display that with physical therapy and time, it is possible to completely recover from a major ACL injury.  There are some situations in which rehabilitation without surgical reconstruction is not very effective for a torn ACL. If other parts of the knee, such as other ligaments, have also been injured, it is recommended that you get surgery. It is also recommended that you get surgery if you are still active, as running, jumping, pivoting, and other activities that give you a higher chance of reinjuring your ACL.	2015-11-05 02:14:31Z	michaelpri	1
3617	3636	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3636	Short answer, yes it is possible to have a full recovery without surgery. If the ligament is only torn, it may heal with a careful recovery plan. If it is torn, most of the strategies revolve around strengthening the muscles that also help stabilize the knee. Most of the links that I would use were already covered in michaelpri's answer, so I would just add a bit. The function of the ACL is to keep the distal (lower) end of the femur from "sliding" off the front of the tibia, and to provide rotational stability. Considering the position of skiing with the knees bent, and weight forward, and the rotation needed in the lower legs for turning (especially if you are a more advanced/mogul style skiier), I would highly recommend you explore the surgical option. In my opinion  , that would give you the best chance to reurn to full activity. In addition, there may be other collateral damage to the meniscus and other structures that could be repaired with surgery. As an aside, I faced the same decision with a complete rupture of the achilles tendon, and opted for surgery. I'm back at full activity, with no after effects.	2015-11-05 19:49:48Z	JohnP	0

As far as health goes, silver has little effect inside the human body for good or for ill. Some studies do suggest that silver may interact negatively with other medication.  I would recommend researching this further if you think it may be a concern. The particle size isn't so important as the total amount of silver taken over time.  No matter how small the particle size, silver will still accumulate in the body.  If sufficient amounts of silver are taken into the body (usually this occurs over several months or years), it may cause a condition called  , which is characterized by a discoloration of skin.  This condition is usually harmless although probably undesirable. The bottom line is this:  .

Especially a recently diagnosed patient  has lots of questions and won't be able to ask all of them at their appointments (questions coming up between appointments, questions from relatives and friends they want to answer, forgetting to ask things, etc.).  However, searching for information on health issues,  , on the internet can be problematic. There are a lot of websites around promising quick cures to all kinds of cancer, if only you eat right / use this product they are selling / stop doing a specific thing / etc. This can lead to patients doing things that they shouldn't, like discontinuing treatments. The internet site Science-based Medicine has a lot of articles in their   debunking such treatments and warning of the dangers.  A much more reasonable approach to this problem would be to provide a patient with trusted sources - pamphlets and such, of course, but also links to websites that can generally be trusted with information about medical treatment, but is accessible to laypeople, like  , or  . For patients a bit younger, the cancer.net website (which is a website by the the American Society of Clinical Oncology) has a list of resources for  . They also have information on  Health care professionals should  encourage patients to discuss anything they read and have questions about with a professional. The reality of today is that, even if you tell patients they shouldn't look something up, they likely will. So it's important they know how to evaluate and deal with the information they find.  If your friend wants to and has the energy to, I don't think it would be wrong to push back on this blanket policy.  Studies done regarding this subject  find that Internet use makes patients more informed and helps them take a more active role in their health care decisions, which may prevent the feeling of helplessness many cancer patients experience. 	2015-11-08 21:52:55Z	YviDe	9
3598	3666	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3666	I agree with @YviDe. There are other possible reasons not mentioned, however. On the internet, which is not tailored to individuals, there is no way to tell which category of a particular illness you fall into. People can read about the worst case scenario and not know how likely or unlikely it is to apply to them. No one wants a patient with cancer to suffer   than they are already destined to. Most likely, it is an attempt to protect the patient from unnecessary worry. The flip side of that is that the medical care provider needs to be able to supply all the information the patient needs. I do acknowledge that there is a lot of good information out there, and the best practice is probably to steer the patient to it specifically. But most often, people are not equipped to evaluate what they read on a medical site. A small but not uncommon example of this is the patient who reads about their medication's   side effects on a website and decides to stop taking it (or worse yet, stop giving it to their child.) They don't know that the risk-to-benefit ratio should already have been taken into account by the prescribing physician. A very good case in point is the whole anti-vaccine thing. That could not have happened without the internet. Finally, physicians don't have the time to address all the quack claims that can be found on the internet about every illness. That might also be a reason to tell the patient to stay away from the internet. If you were a pediatrician, you could attest to how time-consuming it is to talk about vaccines with some parents, regardless of the fact that the person who published the study 1) falsified information, 2) was paid to do it, 3) lost his license to practice medicine because of his unethical behavior  4) no study has ever confirmed his findings and 5) there is copious information on the internet on the benefits of vaccinations.

3553	3560	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3560	Reduced oxygen saturation in blood is called hypoxia (though strictly that means reduced oxygen in the tissues). If there is marked reduction in oxygen saturation of blood, it may lead to bluish discoloration of skin and tongue, called cyanosis.  Mildly reduced arterial oxygen saturation may be due to mild respiratory or cardiac diseases. A common lung condition is chronic obstructive airway disease (or chronic bronchitis, most commonly due to smoking). Congenital cyanotic heart diseases like Tetralogy of Fallot are generally discovered and treated in childhood. Arterio-venous malformations in lung is another cause of arterial oxygen desaturation which may be present in otherwise healthy persons. Persons staying at high altitudes have reduced blood oxygen saturation due to low atmospheric pressure leading to reduced partial pressure of oxygen in inhaled air. Sleep apnea syndrome often seen in obese persons may also lead to hypoxia. Other causes include neurological diseases leading to respiratory depression, respiratory conditions such as severe pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (clots in arteries supplying blood to the lungs), pulmonary edema (lung congestion), pulmonary fibrosis etc, but in all these the person is obviously ill.  In an apparently healthy person, mild hypoxia is likely to be due to smoking or pollution related chronic obstructive airway (pulmonary) disease (COAD or COPD), pulmonary arteriovenous malformation or early pulmonary fibrosis. Mild hypoxia may not result in any symptoms. It may lead to increased hemoglobin level in the blood to compensate for reduced oxygen saturation, as commonly occurs in persons living at high altitudes. The main worry is that the underlying process may progress and hence the cause of desaturation should be investigated. References:	2015-10-29 01:01:04Z	rncardio	1

Some impurities will boil off (some volatile organic compounds, for instance) but some will remain behind. With each boil, you lose some of the water to steam, leaving a more concentrated solution of those contaminants which do not boil off. For example, add a teaspoon of salt to two cups of water; boil away one cup of water, and you'll be left with water that's almost twice as salty as you started with. (Some small amount of salt may be splashed out while boiling.) This is why you should always start out with fresh water; otherwise you're feeding your daughter water which has more contaminants than fresh water. If you want to do that for yourself, that's your choice, but your baby deserves better.

While varicella is one of the most contagious viruses we know of, the primary route of spread is droplets expressed when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread by touching virus from varicella lesions. The virus is believed to have a "short" survival time in the environment (pinning down exactly how short is harder, but this should still be comforting.) As regards your son, Your son is no longer contagious, and if you've had chicken pox, you are not contagious unless you develop breakthrough varicella, which is not as rare as people might think. People with breakthrough varicella are contagious. Breakthrough varicella is usually milder than first infections, and the rash is usually maculopapular (little red bumps) rather than the typical blistery lesions.   The take-home message here is you're fine as long as you don't have breakthrough varicella yourself, wash your hands before entering the building, and aren't rubbing your patients with your son's shirt. As an aside, most of your patients have already had chicken pox; that's why they can get shingles. If they were so immune-compromised that your son's illness could affect them, they would probably break out with shingles before you could carry it to them.

If you look back a few years and consider one of largest experiments in this regard it becomes clear that this is not ideal but possible. The Irish have survived as long as they had enough potatoes available.  Potatoes alone have no fat soluble Vitamins A, D, and no B12. While D might not be a problem in central latitudes because humans may synthesise adequate amounts of this vitamin through sun exposure alone, vitamin A and B12 must be acquired from other sources. The amounts of biotin and of calcium in potatoes is equally quite low. Potatoes are also quite low in essential fatty acids and overall fat content. The protein content is of relatively good quality but with comparably low digestibility and mass.  These deficiencies of potatoes are very well balanced when the diet also contains cow's milk, since  Otherwise the potato is quite unusual in its measured content of nutrients: What potatoes are best known for: source of energy in the form of starch. Phytic acid is an anti-nutrient that diminishes the value of the potato and everything eaten with it. Other problematic substances found in potatoes are lectins, glycoalkaloids and proteinase inhibitors. These secondary nutrients are often touted as very healthy constituents in potatoes. Whether they are or not, in commercially grown potatoes they are almost absent. Varieties differ substantially in their contents. Growing and harvesting conditions influence their value, as do factors like freshness, storage conditions, and how they are prepared and eaten. Most of the most important nutrients are present in potatoes. There may very well be other nutrients missing for something approaching anything like an 'optimal diet', but potatoes already offer a large chunk of what a human typically needs.

There've been conducted medical studies concerning effects of apple eating on lipid profile of hyperlipidemic (having increased concentration of fats in blood) and overweight men. Authors claim that: Studies did not concern healthy people, though. But apple contains fructose so I searched for connections between fructose and triglycerides level and found studies conducted on rats:  Basing on those informations (assuming that metabolism mechanisms in rat are similar to human mechanisms), I would say that any fruits containing high level of fructose can increase triglycerides in plasma. So if you are fuit lover it will be the best for you to eat those with low level of fructose like kiwifruit, citrus fruits or berries.
Also some fruits like  plums, prunes, berries, ripe bananas, and the skin of apples (skins only!) are allowed because they contain dietary fiber (look below) so they can be helpful. Answer to second question: In order to determine whether some ingredients are helpful or not, you have to carry out studies.
I found some research papers about ingedients that are helpful in lowering TG level in plasma. Those ingredients are: Firstly: Garlic. Author of study "Including garlic in the diet may help lower blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides."( ) claims that: Secondly: Resistant Starch - one of insoluble fiber's components. You can find insoluble fiber in lentils, avocado, green beans, peas, cauliflower, zucchini (courgette), celery, nopal, kiwifruit, tomatoes, potato skins. Generally, high-fiber diet seems to help ( ).

3511	1142	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1142	The simpler story is that it is better to eat whole fruit.  The problem with eating smoothies or even drinking fruit juice is that you are increasing the fruit's glycaemic index. For example, an orange has a glycaemic index of 40, while orange juice has a glycaemic index of 50 . The theory goes that low glycaemic index foods lower the risk of metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes and there is indeed epidemiological data which confirms this specifically about fruit and fruit juice:  based on data from 3 studies which followed a total of ~150 000 women and ~35 000 men for 18 to 24 years. . Note that the consumption of fruit juice increases the diabetes risk when compared to baseline, not just when compared to whole fruit.  Seeing that the average person in a Western culture has a higher chance of developing a metabolic disorder than of having difficulties digesting cellulose, we can conclude that, ceteris paribus, fruit is healthier for you than fruit juice. I did not find data on smoothies and purees, they should fall between whole fruit and fruit juice in glycaemic index.  The story gets murkier when we consider your diet as a whole. People are unlikely to eat a whole orange when they are thirsty. So if you are currently drinking orange juice and planning to switch to the same amount of whole oranges and switch to drinking water, this is probably going to be a healthy decision. But if you are going to switch to drinking Coca cola when thirsty, it will likely be worse. While I did not look for data doing this comparison, the glycaemic index of Coca cola is 63 , and it also contributes many calories without them being paired with micronutrients.  There has been some debate on whether recommending diets based on GI makes sense, see these two 2002 reviews (paywalled):   and  . Anecdotally, I'd say that they make sense, as I have seen people lose weight on them without complaining of hunger pangs.         	2015-06-03 19:30:24Z	rumtscho	12
3511	1454	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1454	There is a simpler answer than others on this page. Drinking the calories associated with 4 oranges can be done in about 5 seconds.  This does not give your body's satiety mechanisms time to kick in and diminish your appetite if you are already tanked up on the calories you need for that day. By contrast, eating the fruit (with peeling-time thrown in) is much slower, and gives your satiety mechanisms a chance to tell you that you don't really need the calories in that 4th orange. The biggest nutritional danger today is not scurvy or any other vitamin deficiency.  It's over-nutrition, i.e. too many calories.  By eating the oranges, vs. drinking then, you reduce the danger of over-nutrition.

This is not to be construed as personal medical advice. Second, major ouch! You have my sympathy. You can tell is a fracture is healing by looking for a  . This is a series of radiographs of a more serious tibial-fibular fracture (tib-fib fx for short) at different time periods: There was an extensive repair done on this tib-fib fx, but looking at the week 10 fracture, you will see that, like yours, it doesn't look much different from the day 1 radiograph. What you can see if you look carefully is a kind of softening of the edges of the fractures. This is due to bone remodeling and  . The callus is barely visible in   until week 14 (the image isn't very high quality), and is becoming obvious by week 20. Note the callus is more easily seen in this series: You can see the callus very clearly on week 9 when the leg was still in a cast; it is a rounded, radioopaque bulge adjacent to the fracture. The x-ray labelled "callus" was taken at 4 months. If you look at your radiographs, you can see the callus forming, so long answer short, yes, your fracture(s) are healing. It will take a long time to look   - about a year - on x-ray. "Breaking" the fibula (or fibular ostotomy) in cases of tibial non-union is not unheard of, but I have absolutely no idea of how often it's done, or if the additional weight-bearing associated with it speeds tibial healing. But please note that you already have an angulated distal fibular fracture (look at the bone - the fibula - behind the tibia just above its concave surface in the leg on the left.) It looks to be at about 20°.  Also note that the tibial stress fractures - the fracture lines perpendicular to the plane of the tibial fracture itself - are more prominent in the second set of x-rays (this   just be picture quality), as well as more prominent displacement of your fracture, which is easier to see if you follow the medullary lines - the "hollow" inner part of the bone where the bone marrow is - you'll see they line up nicely in the first set of x-rays, less so in the second. If you don't fully trust your doctor for   reason whatsoever (and clearly you don't),  . It's your leg, and you are to some extent responsible for getting the best medical advice.

You seem focused on angioplasty with the indication of angina (assuming refractory angina and a blockage in the heart arteries that would be causing it).  After angioplasty is done, if a stent is used, you will have to be on a blood thinner for some mandatory time (up to a year...).  This is to ensure that the stent does not immediately clot off causing a VERY BAD HEART ATTACK. You have to understand that there is a big   between a heart attack blockage and a blockage that causes a stable angina.  Stable angina is what a person has due to blockages that are chronic/slowly changing.  ACS (acute coronary syndrome,   a layman "heart attack") is when a fatty blockage suddenly is opened to the inside of a blood vessel, and an acute (fast, recent) clot develops, causing sudden worsening of angina or new angina.  This is a "heart attack".   Simply ballooning open a fatty heart disease blockage in a vessel does NOT cure your "coronary artery disease."  If you have a large blockage causing chronic angina, you are surely to have many many many more blockages, from medium to small which can all cause a heart attack. So the answer to you question depends on whether the drugs are used to treat your angina or your heart disease itself.  If you have a large blockage, then you CERTAINLY have a strong indication to continue medications that are targeted to prevent heart attacks and worsening blockages.  Considering that, statins, aspirin, beta blockers (latter may also be for angina itself) and such drugs that target heart disease will almost always be continued.  This includes drugs that treat underlying causes of heart disease/blockages which include high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, etc. For the drugs you may be on for the anginal pain itself (sometimes beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, etc)--- these medications may no longer be necessary if your pain subsides after the angioplasty.	2016-03-12 21:21:03Z	Rakesh Patel	2

I became extremely unwell, lost a lot of weight, became severely anaemic, malnourished and weak and very very distressed. after about 4 months, I was eventually diagnosed with Severe Ulcerative Colitis. I had a colonoscopy and was prescribed Non steroid medication (MESALAZINE) which helped reduce the symptoms. I eventually began smoking again due to my stress level going through the roof... the UC symptoms subsided completely within days and in time I returned to good health, but remained a smoker. 5 years ago 
i quit smoking and began vaping... this was great for a about 4 months but i then experienced the onset of UC again... was treated with Mesalazine Enemas which helped the symptoms reduce. Once again i started smoking, symptoms stopped. January 2018
1 week ago I quit smoking, the time feels right, I am happy in my life, do not have amy immediate stressors and am in a positive place emotionally, finically etc. My Life on the whole is good (even though the world is sadly not)... Now within just 1 week i have started to experience the onset of UC again... I must admit I am feeling very disappointed but not distressed, as i am informed and am experienced. I have decided to try to smoke 3-4 cigarettes per day until i get seen by a doctor. i know my smoking may escalate, but at the moment that is not my concern, the UC is.
I really hope that i am wrong, but the symptoms are too familiar. I know I am not alone with experiencing UC after quitting smoking, there has been a lot of research, but no definitive answers have been found regarding the link. I am interested in what happened with the person who posted the original question and am more than happy to provide more information if requested. My best wishes to All.	2018-01-14 13:23:03Z	pen	-3

The skin is a barrier of stacked cells mostly made of keratin and lipids. It is covered in aqueous and oily secretions (sweat, sebum) containing salts, acids, peptides, squalene, steroids, etc, as well as bacteria forming a biofilm and that defend you against pathogens.  If you are soaking continuously in water, these components are being washed away. One problem I immediately think of is fungal infection. 
Also, in warm water the skin is only semi-permeable, which is the basis of balneotherapy (absorbing minerals through the skin). With time, water would disrupt the statum corneum, making the skin permeable, resulting in irritations, ulcerations, infections, loss of electrolytes, etc.  Look up "trench foot" or "immersion syndrome" , eg.    These disorders can leave permanent damage on the skin or the organs underneath. Stay dry.	2016-04-08 09:47:34Z	julien	4

3452	3546	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3546	Floaters do move, but not very much. Mostly they "sway and settle" when we shift our focus of vision. Noticing floaters is likely a difference in perception, for example moving your line of sight from one which is complex to one with a simple background, for (a completely made up) example, from looking at a large painting to looking at a ceiling. The lack of contrast will make the irregularities in vision caused by floaters to stand out/be noticeable for a few minutes, maybe even be bothersome and worrisome, but it soon stops. You can "find" floaters by doing that, especially if you look into a softly lit surface, like an x-ray view box without the x-rays.  The vitreous humor (the very structures gel-like collagen & fluid substance in the eyeball behind the iris) starts to break down/liquify in spots as we age; this is a common and benign cause of age-related floaters. You can picture how floaters work by imagining crystal-clear jello that had set in a clear glass. If you took a hot knife and quickly swiped it through the jello, some of the jello would melt; you would see an aberration in the path of light through that spot; you wouldn't see perfectly through it. Turn the glass and the aberration would be different at different angles. That's approximately how floaters work. Some are minimal, some are more marked because of the plane of liquifaction/separation of collagen fibers. They do not "move", though, through the vitreous any more than that melted jello moves through the whole. Sudden onset of floaters disturbing your visual field are most likely not the more benign aging process of vitreous breakdown, and merit a trip (or at   a call) to the opthalmologist. Those kinds of floaters (sometimes associated with flashes) tend to be caused by vitreous detachment from the retina, and can lead to retinal detachments and/or hemorrhages. While often just isolated in nature, it can be a sign of more serious and vision-threatening retinal pathology. I don't know of any way at all to predict or restrict recurrences unless there is retinal pathology being treated by an opthalmologist.

Here is a somewhat condensed timeline of what happens. Levels of alcohol in the blood and in breast milk are generally the same, thanks to diffusion between the various glands in the breasts and the bloodstream (note that there are, of course, specialized veins and arteries for the mammary glands). Diffusion out and in means that there is not a significant net gain or loss of alcohol from the breast milk. One reason for different concentrations in different groups of women depends on how proteins responsible for the filtering and breakdown are released. The authors say (page 16) It's worth noting that only a small amount of the total amount of alcohol makes its way unfiltered into breast milk. As   writes (emphasis mine), This is the key principle. Basically, there is little to no breakdown of alcohol in the mammary glands, due in part to the lack of ADH. While some enters through the bloodstream, it can diffuse out and be broken up in the normal fashion.	2015-12-08 01:27:02Z	HDE 226868	6
3429	3527	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3527	Yes, you can measure that. You can consider using EMF Meter Tester (Electromagnetic Radiation Dosimeter) which can detect electromagnetic radiation around the place of interest. The cheapest one which you can get can measure frequency range between low frequency: 50Hz-400KHz and high frequency: 30MHz-2000MHz which should be enough. It can be used in home electrical equipment, measurement of electromagnetic radiation such as: mobile phone, smart devices, computers, televisions, copiers, fax machines, air conditioners and other power sources of test analysis. I had similar issue where I had a lot of cables and power supplies next to my desk and I had slight headaches because of that. I've purchased EMF Meter ( , similar to  ) and it was showing very high reading around that area (up to 1m far away from the corner). So I think my multi socket extension was just faulty (or wrongly shielded) and the reading was perfectly fine (zero) when I've switched it off. So basically you should test the electric field radiation and if your equipment like computer connect power ground loop well, it would lead electric field radiation to the ground, to shield it, then the test would fail. Besides, metal will shield the radiation. Such EMF meters can be found  .

From   (note that while the paper itself is about people with "Overactive Bladder syndrome", the conclusion about urine not being sterile holds true for the control group in this study as well.  However, it is very unlikely you could get or give someone else some kind of disease through the kind of hypothetical contact you are talking about in your question. The South Australian health ministry for example lists only one disease potentially spread through urine : Cytomegalovirus  . But while the test for this infection can be done through analysing urine, I could not find any evidence that there has ever been an infection that resulted from exposure to urine as opposed to saliva, semen or one of the other transmission routes. 
Another disease found in urine is typhoid : From  . Whether the level in these samples would be enough to lead to infection even if ingested is unclear to me. 
No substance in your urine is actively dangerous to you just by touching it. Even drinking it is generally considered to be safe, unless done too often (it does contain products your body is trying to get rid off).  Drying will possible reduce the amount of bacteria in the urine, just as it does for saliva.  In summary, no, urine is not sterile, but it also doesn't seem to be a "usual" route of infection for many (or maybe any) diseases. Furthermore,  having a spot of it dry on your clothes and a hypothetical person then touching it is bringing the infection risk down even more.	2015-10-16 18:12:36Z	YviDe	7

In my opinion,   is an incredibly vague term. Ensuring you are eating a balanced diet and eating within your daily needs is better way to put it. When you consume an excess of calories that your body doesn't need it often stores this fat independently, for future use i.e. as an energy source.  , despite the bad rep,   and is essential in our diets - more specifically in times of (unintentional?) fasting. Is it healthy to use fat as a stable for your energy needs? No. It's all about maintaining a justified ratio of Carbohydrates; fats and proteins that build a stable foundation for a diet.  Consider this when contemplating a weight loss diet: 'In 2005, the “American Journal of Clinical Nutrition” published the results of a study in which subjects who ate   felt fuller and ate an average of more than 400 fewer calories daily when compared to subjects who ate a diet of 15% protein, 35% fats and 50% carbohydrates.

Additionally, you will only be able to obtain this medicine if you are truly overweight and if you are have "fair" reasoning etc.  belongs to drug class called  . Lipase is the in situ enzyme that breaks down lipids (fats), so that they can effectively be absorbed by our body, and hence inhibiting this enzyme allows most of the fat we consume to pass through our digestive system, to be release via excretion in our fecal matter. It would be fair to say that this treatment is in favor of resisting storage/absorption some types of fat more than others. In this case it's   - fat stored in the abdominal cavity and hence around our major organs. Knowing this, you should be able to comprehend how a physician may deem you suitable for a prescription. If he/she concludes that you are overweight and predisposed to risk of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, the decision will tilt in your favor. Edit: Orlistat is the generic name for the "weight loss" aid not sold over-the- counter. Alli, is   at half its dosage and is sold over-the-counter.	2015-10-29 21:21:04Z	anongoodnurse	3

3404	3410	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3410	Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS; aphthae; canker sores) is not uncommon (>20% of the population of the UK) and can be very painful and disruptive. In addition to consulting a doctor, please consider asking your dentist (dentists deal with this a lot) or a specialist of the mouth (such as an oral surgeon). It may be as simple as your toothpaste choice, or as complex as an autoimmune disorder. In any case, they should help you treat it symptomatically, and may find an underlying cause. There are three "kinds" of RAS based on size and number of ulcers: minor, major, and herpetiform. In addition to treating any underlying disorder, common recommendations - among others - include maintaining good diet (with some attention to B ), oral hygiene, avoiding toothpastes with SLS, and   using mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine or triclosan. For the occasional aphthous ulcer, there is a sticky paste you can apply to the ulcer called  . It has a topical anesthetic and temporarily relieves pain, so that you can eat, sleep, etc. There is also a viscous lidocaine 2% solution which can be swished/spit. The downside of this is that you can't taste anything, as your tongue gets numbed as well. Alternatively, you can apply it to the lesions with a Q-tip. Under the supervision of a physician, topical corticosteroids can sometimes control symptoms that are incapacitating. There are corticosteroid preparations in  , gels, and other. There are prescription antibiotic oral preparations with which one can rinse and spit, usually containing a tetracycline derivative, or tetracycline plus nicotinamide which may provide relief and reduce ulcer duration and recurrence. If RAS fails to respond to these measures, oral  immunomodulators may be required, again under specialist supervision. Complementary and Alternative Medicine recommendations include vitamin supplements, bee propolis, various herbs, and honey.

3397	13249	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13249	The short answer: I haven't come across anything that states that patients with a mild Meniere's episode should rest on principle even if they're feeling well enough to perform activities. So, I think it would be up to the patient's own judgement about what they are comfortable doing. The longer answer: Meniere's disease is a disease of the inner ear, and is associated with distortions of the delicate membranes found in the inner ear. The underlying cause is not fully understood - various theories include that Meniere's disease is caused by a blockage at the endolymphatic sac, genetics, a virus, or a problem with blood vessels, but nobody knows for sure. If a person has definitively been diagnosed with Meniere's disease by a physician, then the treatment focuses on reducing symptoms. Treatments include lifestyle chances (limiting salt intake to 2-3 g per day, avoiding caffeine/alcohol/nicotine/MSG which are harmful substances that can worsen symptoms based on their effects in the inner ear, etc.). Treatments also include certain medicines (prescribed by a physician, e.g. anti-nausea medications like prochlorperazine.) There's also vestibular rehabilitation therapy which tries to help people with their balance, and hearing aids for hearing problems. Finally, there are some surgical procedures that might help in certain really severe cases of Meniere's that don't respond to any other treatments. In all my reading about Meniere's, I was not able to find any studies that suggested that patients should force themselves to rest during a mild Meniere's episode during which they would be capable of performing various activities. At the end of the day "listening to your body" is really a good piece of advice: if the patient feels safe and comfortable performing certain activities during a mild episode, it is probably alright; if they start to feel worse, they can stop what they are doing or take it more slowly. Of course, the best person to answer this question would be the patient's personal physician, since the physician will know the patient's full medical history and will therefore be able to give a more individualized answer.

That is a little different than anaphylactic shock though.    states that "an estimated 4% of the US adult population is food allergic – about 9 million of us". Of that 4%, 15% (1.35 million or  ) would develop that allergy after the age of 18. The public health question is really speculative. Obviously it would be very helpful for those people who are either allergic, or at risk of developing an allergy, since they wouldn't be exposed to the food trigger. However, many of these allergens are extremely prevalent in modern food production (peanuts, soy) meaning that food can be produced less expensively. It is probably more practical to emphasize allergens in ingredient lists (as is done in the US) to enable already-allergic or just-concerned adults to avoid ingredients of concern.	2015-10-15 11:56:51Z	era	5

He mentioned that he does still do certain procedures (valve repair, right heart ablations, etc.) through femoral access. His reasoning was that femoral access can be faster for certain procedures vs radial and this means that less x-rays will be used and less exposure to the patient. He did mention that most cardiologists have developed their own preferences for when to still use femoral access (some even choosing not to do them at all). Radial seems to have become the main method because of decreased risk of bleeding and complications. This also allows patients to be ambulatory in less time than with femoral access, resulting in lower costs both to the hospital and the patient. However, the development of vascular closure devices (VCD's) have reduced the bleeding risks associated with femoral access. This study did show no significant difference in death, myocardial infarction, and stroke between access sites. In a large (8404) multicenter, randomized, superiority  , patients with radial access had less incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events: 8.8% radial vs 10.3% femoral (not significant) In the same study, radial access had less "net adverse clinical events": 9.8% radial vs 11.7% femoral (significant) The study concluded: 	2016-08-24 16:59:25Z	TheChinBurglar	2

If that is a measurement of his eyesight, he is farsighted.

Because of the definition of a Dioptre, there is no maximum/minimum number.  A measurement of -6 is certainly not nothing and will require corrective lenses.

The reason for the dramatic difference in reference ranges is the detection limit of the assay itself. As time progresses, assays become more sensitive to small titers of antibody. In labs using newer techniques, concentrations as low as 9 IU/mL can be detected, so anything above that is considered abnormal.* The question of whether an antibody concentration between 9 and 35 IU/mL is as detrimental as a higher concentration is an interesting one. First, in way of background for those not familiar with anti-TPO antibodies: these are antibodies directed against the thyroid gland. They are most often measured in a patient with   (i.e. elevated TSH but normal free T4). In such cases  .

Note that the mean in the spontaneously improving group would have been considered “less than assay” in a test with a detection limit of 35 IU/mL.  So yes, “somewhere between 9 and 35 IU/mL is actually not that bad”, if “bad” refers to a titer greater than 35 IU/mL and the relative prognostic value is of interest.    	2015-10-03 20:09:44Z	Susan	5

Virtually all tumors are non-transmissible under normal (non-laboratory) circumstances (three exceptions, discussed below, none in humans), so you could not possibly get the cancer the animal had. However some cancers arise because of environmental factors which may still be present in the animal.  For example, an animal exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) would be at a higher risk of developing cancer, and PCBs also tend to stay around in the animal for some time.  It is at least possible that environmental exposure which gave the animal cancer is still around to increase the risk to you.  In general, this is probably a pretty low risk from any one instance of eating a tumorous animal.  However if you were to eat animals which were routinely contaminated with something carcinogenic, it could become a problem.   A similar story could be told about oncoviruses, that is viruses which can cause tumors or cancer.  However all the oncoviruses known to date are restricted to humans.  Further, if there were an hitherto unknown oncovirus which caused the tumor in the animal and still could cause an infection and neoplasm in humans, it would have to survive cooking and consumption.  This route seems improbable. The least probable route would be a directly transmissible tumor.  There are two such tumors known: Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease and canine transmissible venereal tumor.  A third variety was discovered this year ( ), which is found in clams.  None affects humans.  Further, the chances of such a disease being able to transmit across species seems very improbable.  Finally, food preparation is almost certain to kill off the tumor cells. In summary, it is very improbable that eating an animal which had a neoplasm would pose any risk.	2015-10-05 22:54:53Z	Hans	6

Even staph that is more resistant to other antibiotics than it is to methicillin is routinely called MRSA. The standard test for MRSA (differentiated from other forms of staph) is as straightforward as it seems. After S. aureus bacteria is isolated, it is cultured in the presence of methicillin and (usually) other antibiotics. If the staph grows in the face of antibiotics that usually are effective against staph, it is obviously resistant and the diagnosis of MRSA can be made. By using more than one antibiotic in the growth medium, the technician can identify for the practioner which antibiotics are most effective. The different antibiotics are present on specific locations on the agar (or other medium) plate, usually using   . Even among strains that are called MRSA, there are variances as to what antibiotics are effective against that particular colony. The challenging part is that the cultures can take several days, during which time the patient can be growing steadily worse.

3307	4465	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4465	To clear up a bit of a misconception it appears you may have in your question: All carbohydrates are sugars of some sort, either simple or complex. The difference in the body is   to be usable as glucose (Body fuel). To get the answer as to what type you are consuming, you would need to look at the ingredient list, and see what is listed, such as fructose (Simple, fast), high fructose corn syrup (simple, fast), etc. Anything that says sugar, syrup or ends in -ose is likely to be an added sugar of some kind. If you replace those sugars with oat starch, you are basically replacing sugar with sugar, just in a (most likely) slower digesting form. My suspicion, however, is that if you say you are eating 440 calories from sugar, and getting that information from food labels, then you are really only counting added sugars, unless you are looking at nutrition facts for raw/cooked vegetables. For example, if you eat a cup of broccoli, you are getting 10g of carbohydrates. 2.5g of that is in simple sugars (fructose/glucose combo), approx 4 g is fiber (undigestible sugar), and another 3.5g of starch (Complex sugar). That makes 6g of sugars, or 24 calories. As for your base question, if you take out the added/labeled sugars and replace them with slower acting sugars, your energy levels may be slightly lower than after simple sugars, but be a more sustained effect. You may feel fuller for longer as the body takes longer to break down the food, and you may notice it being easier to lose/maintain weight.

I wanted to expand on that by pointing out the US government has put a   center together to study what is academically known as " ."  CAM is basically a catch all for what may be a homeopathic or traditional medicine in any particular location, but paired with modern scientific thinking.  The name of the NIH center is the " ." I think a very   on what exactly they do was written by a previous deputy director.  They represent a growing field of research that applies rigorous logic and scientific testing to alternative medicines.  In other words, they use "traditional medicines" as a starting point to drive new modern interventions. The general premise goes something like this: 1) Community A has traditionally used [Plant/Intervention] B to address disease or symptoms X, Y, and Z. 2) Some aspect of B may infact be pharmacologically/physiologically active.
[Note the null hypothesis can also be, and often is, true; that B provides no benefit over placebo or sham operation.] 3) Break down B into it's molecular or procedural components B[1,2,..n] 4) Compare B components to known interventions to make educated guesses as to what really is going on.  5) Test basic components of B, B as a whole, and mixtures of B components (derived from educated guess) to address X, Y, Z, preferably in an   first. 6) Refine positive results into traditional medicine drug/intervention M NOTE: I make no stance on the legalization of cannabis in the US for recreational use, and could see it go either way.  I think that a honest conversation about medical vs recreational use should be had, and that medical uses should not drive something that is desired for recreational uses.  Please don't derail this post on merits or demerits of cannabis use. The study of cannabis lead to the discovery of   the principal psychoactive component of cannabis.  This lead to the discovery of medical benefits of THC, and the ability for physicians to use THC in drug form dronabinol (brand name Marinol). In our example cannabis would be our [Plant B], nausea and loss of appetite our symptoms X-Y,   our components of B, and Marinol the final drug produced M. As I'm sure it will come up, it certainly could be true that additional cannabinoids will come up to be medically significant, perhaps in certain combinations, and that may require inhalation as a delivery route.  I'm happy for that research to be conducted, and I wait to see what comes out as scientifically valid.   I note that burning and inhaling of a raw plant, with all the chemicals that are produced in the process, is not something I would recommend to any patient.  That goes from tobacco, to cannabis, to grass clippings.  We have nebulizers to aerosol drugs that need to be inhaled. This is where taking traditional medicine as a start, and then advancing it to "Western Medicine" comes in.  The scientific method has born out in pharmacology, and needed active ingredients from plants/animals can be identified, derived, purified, and normalized so that they can be safely and consistently applied in "Western Medicine" (which can be called "traditional" by the people practicing it). 	2015-09-27 17:04:41Z	Community	6

You can exert some control over it, but only really a little bit unless you train rigorously for years. For example, breathing is controlled by the ANS. People   be able - with a very great effort - to hold their breath until they pass out, but the ANS will immediately take over once they do pass out and they will breathe. The ANS, in other words, usually 'wins out'. Likewise, people can lower their heart rates and blood pressure with meditation and biofeedback (also "integrative body–mind training", according to one Chinese researcher.) But if a vicious, salivating, snapping dog jumps out at you from behind a bush, your heart rate and blood pressure will most certainly go up involuntarily, which is not necessarily a bad thing. That same ANS response allows you to run away faster or fight off the dog a bit more forcefully.

Having had to experience such surgery myself, I certainly wouldn't recommend consuming larger and larger chunks of food as a matter of course. As for what actually happens if you   consume large chunks of food - they do take longer to digest as they're not completely broken down in the stomach but are passed through in partially undigested form to the intestines.  On the back of this, you may think this would make you feel fuller sooner but actually, the opposite it true. It is signals from the stomach that indicate to your body that you're becoming full.

3209	3976	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3976	While not all patients with an atrial septal defect experience, complications, but it can be beneficial to surgically repair the defect to prevent future complications that could occur.  Sometimes children with an atrial septal defect will not need surgery as the defect may close itself, but if the hole is large and is determined to be likely to cause problems as an adult, the doctor will usually recommend surgery to prevent possible future complications. This does not really answer your question, though, as you specifically ask about atrial septal defects in adults. By the time they are adults, patients with an atrial septal are likely to start showing symptoms, unless the hole is very small (smaller than 5 millimeters). Studies on patients who have begun to show symptoms show that it is generally beneficial to close the atrial septal defect and can improve the life span in adults and help to prevent further complications, especially in younger patients, usually those younger than 25, while the symptoms may still be nearly non-existent. Even though the closure is not   beneficial to older patients, it is still usually recommended when there are symptoms.   Though the results shown from those studies mentioned above, it can be reasoned that closing an atrial septal defect in a patient in which the defect was found incidentally can be beneficial. Having a very small defect will not typically cause the symptoms associated with atrial septal defects and usually a doctor will not recommend surgical closure of the defect. If a larger defect is found incidentally and any symptoms have yet to occur, then it would be logical to the hole closed. This will help prevent the complications that could occur later in your life and is likely to increase your overall life-quality and lengthen your lifespan.	2015-12-06 08:59:04Z	michaelpri	1
3209	3994	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3994	Agree with @michaelpri regarding some of the timing considerations and the overall sense of factors affecting whether closure is necessary.  As to how ASDs cause harm, the usual effect is one of blood shunting from the left heart to the right heart through the ASD. Over time, this increases the filling volumes of the right heart and can lead to right heart failure as the right heart is pumping some excess volume of blood in a circuit from the right heart to the left atrium, back to the right atrium via the ASD and, ultimately, back to the right ventricle again. In this fashion, left ventricular filling can also be decreased, but generally no penalty on systemic circulation occurs, except in extreme cases. Asymptomatic patients may have a closure depending on the size of the ASD and its specific location. There are studies underway to better understand when to close ASDs.

For OTC medications, a readable label is also required with quite a lot of the necessary information. However, supplements are not governed by the FDA, therefore, the makers are under no obligation to include pertinent information, relying on the consumer to know the particulars for that supplement. The only practical way to know whether your particular supplement should be taken with food is to look up that information yourself.

So the chemicals from smoking do stick to a person and persist in the area.

Prediabetes is the condition when fasting blood sugar is 100-125 mg/dl or 2 hour blood sugar is 140-200 mg/dl (more than 125 fasting or >200 after 2 hours will be diagnostic of diabetes).

Hence, lifestyle modification is advised to all persons with prediabetes. These include regular exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, stopping smoking,  keeping blood cholesterol and blood pressure under control. Persons who have other risk factors of coronary heart disease also, such as high blood pressure, obesity, increased blood lipids etc, may also be treated with metformin, a commonly used drug for control of diabetes. These interventions reduce the risk of progression to diabetes and occurrence of its complications including coronary heart disease.

The normal range is then taken to be 2.5th to 97.5th percentile value. Values above and below this range are categorized as abnormal (abnormally low or high).  For some parameters, e.g. eyesight, one side of range is better than normal and may be called super-normal and not abnormal. Round, convenient values are often taken as limits of normal ranges and mild/moderate/severe categories, so that they can be easily remembered and applied in busy clinics. Some of the blood sugar, blood pressure and BMI cutoffs follow this principle.

Archer appears to make liqueur type schnapps, which means that the fruit is steeped in the alcohol base, rather than distilled from the fruit itself. This means it will have a higher sugar content, and will go bad faster. As near as I can tell, there isn't any adverse health effects reported from drinking out of date alcohol, but the taste can vary wildly, and be anything from a "flat" taste, to very harsh and bitter as the sugars continue to break down. This is moderated by temperature and how much air is in the bottle. So there   be any health effects, other than possibly bad taste.	2015-09-17 21:52:24Z	JohnP	2

However, these studies are done for the scenario of using undiluted honey as a wound dressing. For example, from a recent study: The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of honey are confirmed but the exact mechanism is unclear; it could be due to the acidity, honey's osmotic effect, presence of bacteriostatic and bactericidal factors (hydrogen peroxide, antioxidants, lysozyme, polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, methylglyoxal, and bee peptides), etc.  From a review atricle, Studies have demonstrated that the antibacterial properties of honey are more complex than just high sugar content alone (which decreases tissue fluid to which it is applied, inhibiting bacterial growth.)

3130	9280	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/9280	From the OP's question: It is very likely some of this 1.5 liter of water will be disposed (the reasoning is below) and that's it. 1.5 liter of water at once plus additional water sources does not sound to me like a dehydration scenario (depends on total water gain and loss in day, though).  When you drink 1.5 liter of water at once, this amount will be quickly absorbed into the blood and will expand your blood volume to the point at which various receptors in your circulation system will detect "hypervolemia" and will signal the kidneys to excrete the "excessive" amount of water. If you divide 1.5 liter of water in smaller amounts, let's say 6 glasses (6 x 250 mL = 1.5 L) at least 1 hour apart, then each of those 250 mL would have time to move from your blood into your body cells and "make place" for the next glass of water, which will not expand your blood volume to the extent at which the volume receptors would detect excessive water. This is from my experience. If I drink 1.5 liter of water at once I will excrete some of it shortly (within an hour or so) thereafter. This experiment is very reproducible, so everyone interested can try it. Frequency of water drinking by itself is probably not enough of concern for health to encourage someone to make studies about this, hence the lack of scientific sources to link to. Various rehydration regimens have been established in the context of dehydration but they do not necessary apply for everyday non-dehydration situations, so I do not want to discuss this here. 1.5 liter of water at once for an adult should not be harmful in terms of water intoxication.

3123	3145	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3145	Before the answer I owe you an apology - the Mint family is large, and aside from a large number of species, each has a number of varieties. Different varieties of the same species might have similar chemical composition and pharmacological effects, but look a bit different. The fact is, that I'm not 100% sure from your photo that it is   that we are talking about (most of my sources state that it has pink flowers; leaves are a shaped a bit differently but this might be because the plant is young); still, it might be. Determining the species is tricky even for professionals in such plant families (I was hoping that you got the name of the plant when you purchased it/got it from someone to plant in your garden). Nonetheless, I'll try to answer the best I can: The only   for using   (Peppermint) leaves or   (Japanese Mint) are   - because most members of Mint family have a cholagogic effect (stimulate bile production and excretion) so the patient might experience colic if they use mint leaves, and medical supervision of such use is advisable. For Peppermint the average daily dosage is 3-6 g/day (PDR) or 4.5 - 9g of the herbal substance, for preparation of herbal tea, divided in three doses (HMPC, EMeA). Another contraindication listed for Peppermint in monograph at EMeA is   (gastro-oesophageal reflux) because the condition might worsen with the use of peppermint. Other from these, there are no known health risks associated with the use of these species, in recommended daily doses. For:   (English horsemint),   (Spearmint),   (Wild mint), PDR states: However, dosages are listed only for M. aquatica as one wineglass per day of infusion prepared from 30g of leaves and 500 ml of water.  (Pennyroyal) is associated with hepatotoxicity (prolonged use can damage the liver). However, the plant in your photo doesn't look like M. pulegium to me.  I' recommend taking a sample of your herb to a local botanical garden if possible and asking for help with species determination there, just to be on the safe side. A somewhat less reliable option would be to post the photo of the plant on biology SE and see what they think of it (but determining the species of the plant from a photo is less reliable than with an actual sample). As for the quantity - I wasn't able to find a reliable source for the number of leaves used, so the safest method might be to measure the quantity you use and see if it fits the recommended doses (or to measure the maximal daily dose and try not to exceed it).

3108	4353	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4353	First, a correction. ADHD is NOT caused by a dopamine deficiency. It is way more complex than that, but i won't go into detail here. The best treatments for ADHD alter dopamine activity (and they are very effective), but that doesn't mean the cause for ADHD is a dopamine deficiency. So the question is how vortioxetine can help in ADHD. Well, the short answer is that one major part of ADHD (the "look-a-squirrel-forget-what-you-were-doing part") is working memory. Vortioxetine has been shown to have positive effects on working memory, at least in depressed patients. It wouldn't be too far out to assume it could have similar effects for ADHD-patients. The long answer is that  , so that increasing signaling in one can increase or decrease signaling in another. It gets even more complex when you add receptor subtypes to the picture. Serotonin has 14 receptor subtypes that we know of, with different roles and effects. Then add that the same neurotransmitter on the same receptor has different functions depending on where it is located in the body or brain. Now you have a nice, complex picture. Vortioxetine activates 5-HT1A (serotonin 1A), which increases dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex and deactivates 5-HT1B, which also increases dopamine signaling in the PFC (same neurotransmitter, same location, different receptor, opposite effect). It also deactivates 5-HT3 and 5-HT7, both of which have effects that strengthen signaling in the PFC (through the serotonin, noradrenalin and glutamate systems). All of these effects could be relevant for improving ADHD-symptoms. So that's how it could help in ADHD.	2016-01-11 08:30:55Z	OWH	3

In regards to OCD, Reference 5 states that their evidence suggests newer "agents (ADs) should be tested more comprehensively.".

3106	4250	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4250	Dopamine (DA) is a catecholamine neurotransmitter associated with attention and motivation (9). It is implicated in various other conditions such as psychosis, and Parkinson's disease (9). Noradrenaline (NE - norepinephrine in North America) is a catecholamine neurotransmitter that plays a role in attention and arousal (9). NE is produced from DA. (5) Serotonin (5-HT) in an indolamine. 5-HT modulates mood, aggression, dominance, appetite, and sleep (9).  The most prevalent theory of the pathogenesis of ADHD is that it results from an "deficiency" of some of the various monoamine neurotransmitters. DA, NE, and to a lesser degree 5-HT, are all implicated (5)(6). DA is the neurotransmitter most heavily associated with ADHD, and its role in the mediation of the disease was primarily elucidated by methylphenidate's effect on dopaminergic neurotransmission (6). Different antidepressants work through different mechanisms. The major  antidepressants are segregated into three classes: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), TCAs, and SSRIs.  MAOIs "increase" the levels of all of the monoamine (DA, NE, and 5-HT, among others) neurotransmitters by preventing the deamination of these neurotransmitters by inhibiting the activity of the monoamine oxidase (8). The affinities for different transporter proteins varies widely in the TCA class. TCAs are generally considered to inhibit the reuptake of NE and 5-HT, although this varies greatly from TCA to TCA. Clomipramine, for instance, has a much higher affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) than the noradrenaline transporter (NET) (7). Amitriptyline has relatively balanced 5-HT and NE action, whereas desipramine and nortriptyline very selective for NET. (7) SSRIs (as the name suggests) are most potent at inhibiting SERT.  Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) are the main class of antidepressants used to treat ADHD typically in conjunction with a stimulant. Most TCAs inhibit the reuptake of NE into the presynaptic clef. This is a mode of action shared with stimulant medications. Their efficacy in the remediation of ADHD symptoms is inferior to that of the stimulants (3). Due to the lack of action on dopamine neurotransmission, TCAs only treat the hyperactive element of ADHD - in other words, they often fail to improve concentration (3). Desipramine, because of its selectivity for NE reuptake inhibition, is the TCA most frequently used for ADHD (2).  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors  (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine are occasionally used in conjuction with stimulants (3). Contaminant use of fluoxetine with a stimulant results in a significant increase in school performance, and attenuation of irritability:   (3). Low serotonin is associated with impulsivity and aggression (3). It's hypothesized in (3) that fluoxetine may influence the brain's response to DA. 	2015-12-31 02:37:59Z		7

I didn't find a source that showed peak concentrations in   or that looked at the delay in B6 crossing the   (which it will readily given its solubility), but there is little reason to suspect that it is too delayed thereafter.    have shown that the vast majority (80-90%) of B6 is stored in muscles and the liver, so even though the peak concentration for the CNS will follow Cmax, most of the B6 will not end up there. Your next two questions are mostly implicitly answered in the first question.  The peak and greatest portion are likely to be very close together (I couldn't find any evidence of delayed metabolism in the CNS).  But expanding on your third question a little, it gets there via the blood, which is pretty standard for most drugs/nutrients/vitamins in humans.  As far as taking it from swallowing the pill, it then continues along the digestive tract to the small intestine.  Mostly in the  , but somewhat in the   (2nd and 3rd part of small intestine) it passively diffuses into the blood, where it circulates through the heart and eventually to your brain. Eating more food may prolong the time the pill is in the stomach, thereby delaying the time that the B6 is absorbed in the small intestine.  Generically this is called gastric emptying, and an approachable site on the subject can be found  .  Even though I'm pretty sure this is made up data to estimate the point, I think it's worth duplicating their time graph: I would like to point out, that this is not something that you will be able to time on a stopwatch and fine tune.  Any of these values could easily vary by an hour.  I also want to point out that taking high doses of B6 can be habit forming, and that the   cited in the wiki is far from convincing.

Something that can vibrate your molecules has the power to kill you. It just requires a great enough intensity or decibel level. (If you get anything loud enough it could shake you apart.) How loud, well  . You would probably die from the explosion that caused that noise level first though. In the example of your question, volume would not work, as any sound loud enough to kill you in that way would obviously affect others in the room. That leaves the question of frequency. If in theory you could find a resonance frequency of a particular anatomical structure and produce that frequency for a long enough period and isolate all other structures from it then you could in fact kill someone in that way. For example eyes, in this NASA Technical Report   they found the frequency of eyeballs.  While not exactly the same as in your example the theory is plausible though extremely unlikely. There are far to many variables and limits with current technology to implement the headphone assassination. But   are some other sound weapons that begin to enlighten the realm of possibility.

3069	3092	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3092	I think you are having difficulty finding the answer because you are perhaps not asking the right question(s). How would you support the assertion that more isn't being done to "improve their function"? The fact that you don't know about something doesn't mean it's not being investigated.  You will not find any support for your proposal because stenting is not a benign procedure, and the risks of stenting the Eustachian tube far, far outweigh the benefits, as well as the risks of the alternatives. At least tympanostomy tubes have a physiological comparison in ruptured tympanic membranes.  First, the Eustacian tube (ET) is normally   in people of all ages.  The ET also opens with yawning. Compare how much time is spent in the resting phase of ET function (all the seconds or minutes spent between swallows and yawns.) This normally non-patent state prevents the migration of bacteria-laden fluids from the posterior pharynx into the sterile middle ear. Eustachian tube function is a complex affair; it's not easily tampered with. The following details what occurs normally with swallowing (please keep in mind that the pharyngeal end of the ET is above where a bolus of food or saliva passes during swallowing): A chronically patent ET is pathological (it's called a Patulous ET or PET), and is quite uncomfortable, so much so that ENT's try   the tube shut: It should be obvious that on a purely physiological basis, a stented ET is not a good idea. In addition to migration of bacteria-laden fluids into the middle ear, there is a problem with sound conduction, inappropriate air movement with even minor activities such as whistling, making certain consonant sounds, the difficulty of something as simple as swimming, etc. God help the kid who would start laughing with a mouth full of partially masticated food (have you ever been so caught off guard by something funny while eating or drinking that it comes out the nose?) Imagine the mess that would make if the ET were continuously patent. It's a recipe for disaster. Add to that the surgical complications, which would be considerably more substantial than with simple (yes, simple) myringotomy tube placement. Finally, those structures allowing ET function are delicate cartilagenous structures, and can easily be damaged by a foreign body (the reason even temporary, dissolvable ET stent use is not recommended). In the 80's, this was done in animal studies. Why you don't find papers of its use in humans is easy to deduce. Finally, you are mistaken that there are no attempts to treat (improve) ET dysfunction. There are surgical procedures available for those with severe ETD. For millions of years, ear infections either resolved on their own, killed the host, or resulted in tympanic membrane (TM, eardrum) perforation. It was very, very common when I was first practicing to look at an adult's TM and see a healed perforation.  Yes, antibiotic resistance developed with overuse of antibiotics. But fewer cases of deafness, mastoiditis, and death from meningitis and brain abscesses occurred as well. We live and we learn.

Please, bear with me for a while, to see the  : The problem with concentration when you haven't eaten arises primarily because of the lack of nutrients, i.e. glucose. So basically, you can't focus because  . It's somewhat similar to a car: yes, you can add water to the radiator (and need to), and yes you can add sparks to make your engine start, but without fuel it just won't run.  It can hurt both your stomach and can make you feel even less focused after a short while. To sum it up - caffeine will make you more alert for a short while, but it will eat up little fuel that you had left, and leave you almost completely without it. For the half hour, 40 minutes perhaps, you will feel better, but then the problems will start - even stronger sense of hunger, worse problems with focusing on your work and possibly light-headedness and hand trembling might occur. Caffeine will stimulate the release of gastric acid and bile, which are meant to digest food. But, since there will be no food to digest it will begin to "digest" your stomach instead (well, not literally, but it can cause you pain and problems, especially if you make a regular practice of it). Water might leave you feeling fuller for a while, but it won't solve the underlying problem (lack of brain fuel), and large quantities of water, drank in a relatively short time span, on an empty stomach, might leave some feeling a bit sick (the smaller the stomach volume, the worse it gets). It's not dangerous, but can be uncomfortable. For 2 and 3 - just remember to occasionally check those places and expire dates - no one likes to find a 10-month old bag of raisins in their purse/desk/key drawer.

They are absolutely essential for growth and maintenance of the body function and their deficiency can cause various problems.  They are precursors for both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules ( ) but you should not assume that inflammation is always bad. It is how your immune system works to identify and destroy pathogens.  PCB stands for   which are aromatic molecules used for industrial applications are known environmental pollutants. Omega-3 fatty acids have no relationship with these molecules. PCB are much more oil-soluble (lipophilic) than water soluble (hydrophilic). When they are dumped in the environment and are taken up in the bodies of different organisms like fishes, they are effectively partitioned into the fatty compartments of the body (because of higher solubility). The fish oils, that are used as one of the primary sources of the omega-3 fatty acid supplements, therefore concentrate the PCBs that the fishes are exposed to, throughout their lives.  NOTE: The terminologies good-cholesterol and bad-cholesterol are just utterly stupid because cholesterol is cholesterol and it has both good and bad effects depending on how much of it is present in the body.

Age is a   that goes into the calculation, not a  . What they're saying there is that with increased age comes increased risk of failure. This is because as we age we don't tolerate and recover from major surgeries as well, and we are also more likely to have other illnesses. To take a hypothetical example, consider two patients: Patient 1 is 70 years old, suffering from heart failure but has no other significant health issues such as diabetes, COPD, etc. Patient 2 is 40 years old, suffering from the same type of heart failure but also has diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease. There's a decent chance Patient 1 would be the selected recipient in this case because he probably has better odds of surviving the procedure, and possibly even better odds of living longer afterwards. But the reality is that there are almost never just two potential recipients so this is a contrived example. Patient 1 would most likely be in "competition" with a dozen other recipients, most of whom will be younger and therefore won't have the age risk factor working against them. In summary, the older patient's best hope is that he or she is in excellent physical condition apart from the heart problems that landed them on the transplant list.

There are two modified amino acids in collagen- hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, which are essential for the structural integrity of the protein. Vitamin-C is involved in natural production of these amino acids in the body from the unmodified amino acids and hence the deficiency of Vit-C results in scurvy.

To answer your other question, whether the condition is hereditary, it may, but doesn't have to be. The only way to determine this is to find the cause of fainting in both cases, that is in your and in your father's case. On a general note, conditions caused by genetic disorders (i.e. mutations) may be monogenic (mutation is found on a single gene) and polygenic (mutations are on several genes, and one has to inherit more than one, for a condition to manifest). Than, there is a matter of a pattern in which the condition is passed on - whether the condition is dominant or recessive (i.e. whether the condition will manifest itself if you have the gene for it from one parent, or only if you inherited a certain mutation from both parents). In the end, there are multy-factorial conditions: The claim   is, as anongoodnurse noticed, proportional to overall number of diseases, but there are still a lot of conditions that are genetic. So the matter of whether the conditions in a parent and child are connected isn't always straight-forward, but the place to start is definitely to determine the aetiology  in both cases, which can be done by a physician (in person).

They are chemically similar, and have some similar effects*: the formula above shows theobromine, and this is caffeine. Of course, there is the concern if you react like you described to one xanthine derivative (caffeine), would you react in a similar way to another compound from this group. Also the atypical reaction to caffeine might be something you want to have checked further (i.e. consult a physician about it).  There are many chemicals (some found in various herbs) that have various sorts of stimulating effects on the central nervous system, but tampering with the CNS can be very dangerous, and indeed many of these substances have serious side effects, far more serious than caffeine. An aside: depending on how alert one needs to be, a lemonade can be a quick home remedy: water will keep you hydrated (necessary for alertness), sugar (or honey) will keep your brain "fueled", vitamins will help your metabolic processes, and sour taste does have a short-term awakening effect. Of course, like with anything, moderation is the key. *Various research papers show controversial results regarding the stimulating effects on theobromine (some show some effect, some don't, and some show opposite effects in certain doses). They mostly agree that the effects are weaker than in caffeine, dose dependent, and may depend on previous use of products containing caffeine and/or theobromine. (see ref 4, 5 and 6).

The inflammation is what usually causes the pain and can lead to additional compression injury of the surrounding tissue or chemical irritation of surrounding cells. With all of that said inflammation is a normal part of the healing process and should be controlled, not eliminated. The way that ice treats inflammation is by numbing pain and constricting blood vessels to reduce the amount of fluid flow to the area thus decreasing the amount of swelling. There are risks to using ice as with any treatment.    To avoid this risk is not usually a matter of temperature ( ) so much as duration of exposure. It is true that the duration will vary based on the temperature, but when using ice in a clinical setting the temperature is usually 0 degrees because the ice is melting. To further reduce that risk it is often recommended that ice directly from a freezer never be placed directly on the skin, but should be wrapped because it could be colder than 0 degrees. The general rule for cryotherapy is to apply ice until the area is numb or 20 minutes, which ever comes first. There is no definitive research out there regarding cryotherapy, and there are many   and techniques used clinically. There is no target temperature that every clinic uses and measurement would not be cost effective.

For example, higher consumption of sugar leads to a litany of health issues, of which problems with gall bladder is just one among many. So, a person that fits this bill has their gall bladder removed, their person life expectancy is not changed. Absent a lifestyle change, if they were going to live to be 70, after gall bladder surgery, they will still live to be 70.
If you have a lower sugar consumption, and hence a healthier lifestyle (all things being equal), well, you were going to live longer anyway, and probably won't need your gall bladder removed. But if you did a data query on life expectancy and gall bladder removal it would be difficult to make a precise correlation that would not be directly associated with gall bladder removal, that couldn't be laid at the feet of just a general lifestyle issue.

1968	5081	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/5081	The disease associated with low cortisol is known as   (so-called because the   are responsible for   production). Morning cortisol is not a definitive test for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.  That is because cortisol varies according to a circadian rhythm (i.e. with your body's sleep-wake cycle).   The x axis represents time across a 24h day.  The transition from dark yellow to light yellow indicates the habitual wake time. The y axis shows plasma cortisol level. The OP mentioned   that this value was obtained four hours prior to his habitual wake time. As shown on the graph above, this is predictably a trough (i.e. low point) in serum cortisol. On the other hand, the "normal" range is likely calibrated for the   level. (This test is supposed to be done shortly after waking, approximating the peak.) The fact that a value below the normal range was obtained is predictable.  For this reason, a confirmatory test is required to make the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. This generally involves administration of   – the physiologic stimulator of cortisol production – and assaying cortisol levels at fixed intervals afterward to evaluate for an adequate rise. Only after inadequate adrenal response is demonstrated can the diagnosis be made.   In direct response to the OP's questions, then: No, except in exceptional circumstances, a confirmatory test is required before treatment.  The  , and the OP indicates that there actually was some complaint prompting the testing. Inadequate treatment of adrenal insufficiency can go unnoticed until a stressor triggers a life-threatening condition known as  .  If a true inadequate response to ACTH is demonstrated, this should be treated.  It is standard to follow a low cortisol level with a ACTH stimulation test. On the other hand, if this is only mildly below the reference range of your lab, given the likelihood that what has actually been measured is closer to a trough than a peak cortisol level, one could imagine a scenario where it might be reasonable to drop it. In addition to the reference range, the details of the presenting complaint and any physical exam or laboratory abnormalities would be necessary to make a decision in that regard.

But from pragmatic approach I would not recommend using those patches before and during an effort. The pain in your elbow is an indicator for microscopic damage, mostly tears, and swelling.

We know that there are must be spacing schedules when the consequences must be milder than with other schedules. But we have neither the data nor the mathematical models needed to make a prediction about which waiting time minimizes the negative consequences.  The first problem is in the effect you were interested in initially: they are both psychoactive drugs, changing your mood and cognition. If you combine them, the effect can be stronger, or weaker, or you can experience changes which you wouldn't have experienced if you were taking only one of them. But this kind of thing is very, very hard to measure. A cursory search doesn't even find a study which seeks evidence for such interaction, much less trying to find consistent patterns in this interaction or investigating its time dimension.  The second problem is that there is also a metabolic interaction, described in arkiaamu's  . This means that the metabolism rate of each drug (which already has a very wide spread between individuals) changes the metabolism rate of the other! Predicting how it develops in a given individual will take as much effort, computational time and data as predicting the weather for a given location. It's certainly not possible to derive some general rule.  So, all we know that it will have some negative consequences. What you also asked is if there is a "coffee must not be taken at all" rule. If you were to just look at the interaction between coffee and antidepressants, then yes, you should stop drinking coffee at all, because you cannot avoid the interaction.  But such a view would be very short sighted. Coffee has both positive effects such as   and   and negative effects, subsumed in one study as  . None of these has some standard quantification so that one could say that medically, the risks are more than the benefits, or the other way round. Now, with the interaction with antidepressants, you are adding one more negative effect. Still, the situation is the same: we cannot measure whether it is better to take the caffeine or not take it.  In the end, it is similar to all matters in nutrition. We know that what you choose to do will have some effect, but the effect is so complex that it is impossible to make a prediction of what it will be exactly, and derive specific advice based on that. 	2015-09-21 11:42:16Z	Community	5

1937	4128	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4128	Endorphins are neuropeptides that can bind to opioid receptors, thus exerting an analgesic effect in the brain. You mention a counterpart,  which is a badly defined concept in this context. There are other substances that can bind to these opioid receptors (opiods, for one :-)) and substances that can block opioid receptors without triggering them, like naloxone and naltrexone. Those are called opioid antagonist and for example used for treating substance dependence. They don't cause pain, though.  Pain is transmitted in the body through neurons the same way other signals are transmitted. The difference to other signals is in how the brain interprets these signals. If they are coming from pain receptors (nociceptors), they are interpreted as pain. There is no special neurotransmitter for pain, though as all signal transmission, there isn't just one. Pain transmission is also relatively slow compared to some other neuronal activity, having to do with the mixture of neurotransmitter and the way nocireceptors are structured.  For example, for pain generated by heat exposure: Basically, in this case there are two signals being transmitted, one normal temperature signal and one pain signal.  Stress is not a signal that is transmitted through any pathway in the human body. With high stress levels come changes in brain chemistry, for example in cortisol and adrenaline levels, but again, these aren't exactly counterparts of endorphins.   	2015-12-19 09:44:09Z	YviDe	1

If you search online one will find hundreds and thousands of journal articles stating "the remedy for hang-over". Of course these "remedies" are based just on folklore. There is also some scientific literature on this topic. The most comprehensive is  . Unfortunately the authors conclude:  I am quite sure that if an effective treatment to reduce or limit the effects of alcohol were to exist, that would have gained popularity beyond any limits. However, I would present on interesting theory to try. Alcohol or ethanol itself is not the bad guy. Body processes ethanol by oxidating it to acethaldehyde with the help from alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. The acethaldehyde is responsible for all the bad, including nausea, vomiting etc. It is also a   associated most importantly to gastric cancer. To deal with this potential carcinogenity, a Finnish biotechnology Company Biohit has introduced a drug called  . It is a very simple drug, it only contains l-cysteine, an essential amino acid. The trick is that L-cysteine reacts with acethaldehyde forming a compound molecule which has no meaning or effect in human body. As so the Biohit aims to market this product as a pre-emptive treatment for gastric cancer. But the interesting part if, that is L-cysteine neutralizes acetaldehyde, why could not it therefore be an effective treatment for hangover? Just take some Acetium before drinking and do not worry about the next Morning. . My secret dream is to perform a randomized controlled trial about this idea. Of course, prior to it, I should contact Biohit to make sure that I receive the appropriate rojalties from their sells. Let´s say this treatment really worked in my trial, I would most likely become a multi-billionaire. Alongside I would be responsible for tripling or quadrupling the amount of consumed alcohol around the world since no one would ever suffer from hang-over. People would however get more drunk since this drug only prevents hangover. As so, the rate of homicides, beatings and drunk driving would go thorough the roof.

1897	1898	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1898	Patients successfully treated for Lyme Disease do not need monitoring of any kind (there is no advantage to this.) There are no recommendations for routine antibody levels post Lyme (in fact, it is discouraged, because no one knows what the levels signify), nor yearly exams or other. It is the responsibility of the patient (and the patient should be so instructed) to return if they are having continuing or new problems. A bit of background: The diagnosis and (standard) treatment of Lyme should be swift and proactive,   reliant on positive antibodies. The possibility of Lyme should be present in a physician's mind when seeing a patient with typical signs and symptoms (and should be treated   any confirmatory testing is completed), as well as any illness which presents a diagnostic challenge. Unfortunately   doesn't always translate to  . This is an interesting question on a lot of levels, some of the answers to which are still being worked out. Typically when a person is first exposed to a pathogen, the early antibodies made are of the IgM class, followed temporally by IgG. IgM should not be made on re-exposure, but re-exposure should kick up the level of IgG. However, Borrelia   infections are not typical. In people treated early for Lyme, often IgG never develops. IgM, on the other hand, can persist for two decades or more (studies are still ongoing) as well as IgG in those who formed these antibodies. IgM, therefore, is not as predictive of initial infection as in other infections. Antibodies can't be relied upon to make a diagnosis. Many patients who receive early and appropriate treatment for Lyme disease continue to live in or frequent regions where ticks are endemic, therefore repeated tick bites are quite common.  This was  ! In one study, the reinfection (not to be confused with continuing symptoms following treatment) rate within the 5 years following initial successful treatment was ~50%.  Reinfection is usually accompanied by recurrence of EM and/or the fever, myalgia, and arthralgia common with initial Lyme Disease, though there is   (not strong) evidence that symptoms may be less severe on reinfection. So suspicion should remain high in people who live in endemic areas, of those counties near to endemic areas because of the spreading of the bacterium, time of year (most new infections occur in July, June, August and May, in descending order; there's no reason to suspect reinfection is any different), etc. In the foreseealbe future, there will be tests to determine the presence of bacterial DNA in joint fluid, tissue samples and other, which will help in the diagnosis of the illness, success of treatment, and reinfection. But medicine isn't quite there yet.   No, it wouldn't be possible to test for the diagnosis. If a person in an endemic area presents with a tick bite in which the tick was starting to become engorged, a single 200mg dose of doxycycline has been shown to effectively prevent 80+% of new infections, so that's always an option (one I'm not   sure of.) If the patient goes on to develop the rash or flu0like symptoms, a full course of antibiotics is then given.  There are insufficient studies about the immunology of reinfection. The diagnosis and treatment will depend on the discernment of the patient + physician. If the person is in an area with high infection rates, the index of suspicion and willingness to treat should be high.

1881	1886	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1886	There are multiple questions here so I'll tackle them one by one.  Your initial question: Can a gummy bear give me diabetes? One giant gummy bear, alone, is very unlikely to give you diabetes. I don't want to say indefinitely, because nothing in health is a definite. However, the likely hood is so close to 0% I would consider it insignificant.  Next, you stated that immediately following the ingestion of a cute gummy bear, you felt tired and the next morning your breathe smelled sweet.  The reason for both of these symptoms can very well be due to your sugar levels becoming drastically high. In the medical field, we call this DKA. (Diabetic ketoacidosis). Essentially, your body recognizes a sharp increase in blood glucose levels and is trying everything in the books to expel the glucose. Your body does this by releasing ketones from your respiratory system. DKA is most notably recognized by sweet smelling breathe. Almost like juicy fruit gum. DKA can actually be a very serious emergency which, if unchecked, can lead to a diabetic coma. However, for individuals without diabetes, and a properly working pancreas, your sugar levels should be back to normal by now.  I believe your incident with the cough is completely unrelated.  To recap. No I do not think you have developed diabetes due to a single gummy bear. However, it never hurts to be checked for the disease. You could very well already have diabetes, and the gummy bear threw you into DKA. Because I cannot see you, nor properly perform any tests. To cover myself for any legal issues I will say that 1. I am not a doctor and 2. Go get it checked.  In regards to telling your parents. Just say you had some candy and you felt really weird afterwards and you're nervous that you might have diabetes.

They will also want to know most of the same information. In some cases where the patient is not showing any symptoms, they may have you try to induce vomiting. The generally recommended method is syrup of ipecac, and if that is not available, then take the person to the nearest ER. You don't want to try to induce by shoving things down their throat. That can cause damage to both you and the patient. If they want you to induce, they will tell you. Also, speaking from a previous EMS/ER background, if they pump the stomach and/or induce vomiting, they will try and see if they can identify what was taken in the stomach contents that come up. If the person you are with vomits, it would help to try and gather the contents to take with you. Further reading:

(part of the NIH), for example, says that These epoxies are what is used in the cans for canned foods, and they contain BPA. It subsequently leaks out in minute quantities, although this is thought to be related to the temperature of the can, not aging. This is not quite as clear. The FDA has changed   over time as new research showed different conclusions.   reviewed previous studies. One recent one found that adults are exposed to about 0.2 micrograms of BPA per day, while young children and infants are exposed to about 0.5 micrograms per day.  However, other research had shown that hazardous levels were in general orders of magnitude higher than these doses. Thus, in the FDA's most recent findings, BPA in food cans is not a problem. However, the agency has made it clear that it continues to revise its recommendations as new information is available. None of this should be taken to mean that BPA is not hazardous to humans. Higher amounts can prove toxic, as the chemical is thought to disrupt the endocrine system (see   and  ). This can, in some cases, lead to severe effects, possibly including cancer, and especially when applied to children. It may also cause neurological harm (see   and  ). In short, while BPA may pose a threat to humans in high enough quantities, its presence in canned food linings does not appear to be dangerous.

1865	1877	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1877	To get an understanding of the difference, look at a disease that has been in the news recently, Legionnaire's Disease. Legionella pneumophilia is a bacteria that is responsible for most cases. It lives in stagnant water under certain conditions, and is inhaled when aerosalized. This is the etiology of the disease, which is basically how it infects the host, or how it gets in. Once inside the body, it starts replicating and causing damage. Initial symptoms include flu like symptoms, headache, fatigue and muscle pain. As it progresses, they can expand to include dry coughing, chest pain, and eventually leading to possible mental status changes, hallucination, etc. This progression of the disease in the various stages is the pathogenesis of the disease, i.e. days 1-3 expect these symptoms, days 4-7 these other symptoms, and so on. To confirm the diagnosis, the doctors will take samples of various body fluids and send them to the lab for testing, as well as x-rays, etc. One of the tests is staining of the sputum that can show the Legionella bacteria. This is pathology, specifically the examination of body fluid/tissue for diagnostic purposes. (Where it gets a little confusing, is pathology also refers to the body of knowledge about disease cause and effects). So in a general sense you are correct, they all refer to how/why diseases spread and how to control them, but one doesn't necessarily depend on the other. Edited to add: Pathophysiology is kind of an intersection, to where the pathology of a condition and the physiology are taken as a whole, and describes the functions and changes associated with a condition from both the observable and the testable views.	2015-08-14 18:30:45Z	JohnP	3

Lets take coronary artery disease and cholesterol as an example. Coronary arteries are probably the most important blood veins in the body since they transport arterial blood from aorta to the heart muscle itself. Coronary artery disease means that heart muscle receives insufficient volume of blood via the coronary arteries and in some instances the blood supply may even be blocked (heart attack or critical ischemia as a milder case). Why blood flow to heart muscle is reduced. It is due to  . Atherosclerosis is the   of coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis causes the artery walls to thicken and stiffen and when the cross area of the artery is reduced less blood is moved though coronary arteries. On the other hand the   of atherosclerosis is high blood LDL level ("bad" cholesterol). Fat and cholesterol which we receive from food are transported in blood and one transport vehicle is the LDL. LDL is bad since it has ability to get in to the artery wall. In there it causes an inflammation cascade which results to plaques inside the wall. These plaques (=calcifications) are hard are rock and causes the artery wall thicken and stiffen.  The presence of the inflammation and variable sized plaques or calcifications in the artery wall are important aspects in the   of the atherosclerosis ad subsequent coronary artery disease. In a healthy heart there are no plaques and the artery walls are intact. Pathology describes what is abnormal in certain diseases. Cascade resulting to certain pathology or pathological condition is  . I consider   as a synonym for pathogenesis. I would even introduce a third term:  . As so, the pathogenesis or pathophysiology or atherosclerosis would be the following: LDL particles are carried in the blood. Once in the coronary arteries, LDL particles penetrate the inner layer of the artery wall. Inside the wall the LDL particles are broken to smaller particles. Marophages invade the wall and they phagocytes (digest) the small LDL particles. These macrophages becomes foam cells which are non-functional fat-laden macrophages just laying in the artery wall. When this process goes on continuously the artery wall starts to thick and cross area of the artery becomes smaller (stenosis).  is a whole another thing.

1803	1807	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1807	H.pylori infection is a latent infection in the human stomach mucous layer  . This infection is basically asymptomatic. This infection, however, may cause chronic gastritis. Chronic gastritis is also asymptomatic in most people. Heart burn is not a typical sign of chronic gastritis. In addition to chronic gastritis, H.pylori is able to harm the protective layer in the stomach lining. Since the surroundings in stomach are very acidic (pH~2), any damage done to the protective layer predisposes to stomach ulcer since the gastric acid damages the deeper layers of the stomach lining. These ulcers are usually symptomatic and can cause heartburn and pain in the upper abdomen. NSAIDs can harm the protective layer of stomach in the same way as H.pylori and there they predispose to ulcers also. However, I find it very difficult to believe that helicobacter would cause migraine. There is at least   and   on this subject. Both are published in a quite questionable Open Access journal. The studies included in the meta-analysis are all quite low quality studies.   conducted on Iran seems quite dubious also. This study has caused some concerns, as can be seen in PubMed.  The causal relationship between H.pylori eradication and migraine can be studied quite easily and safely in large populations. As so, I am suspicious with regard to these studies since there are no randomized controlled trials published in high quality medical journals on this matter.   in the New England Journal of Medicine outlines the current   diagnostic modalities: There is absolutely no indication to eradicate H.pylori in patients who are totally asymptomatic. The prevalence of H.pylori infection is so high that half of the world total population should be on antibiotics. Moreover, if the eradication of H.pylori is successful, you will receive almost surely within the next weeks. If one is diagnosed with an ulcer, a reflux disease or h.pylori is seen tissue samples obtained during gastroscopy or the reason of dyspepsia is suspected to be H.pylori infection, the eradication is reasonable.	2015-08-06 20:21:15Z	arkiaamu	3

Air moving over your face as you sleep is going to have more of a drying effect on your nose, sinuses, and throat than still air.

The reason the membranes inside your upper respiratory tract are called mucous membranes is because they secrete mucous, which serves a   against pathogens and airborne particles. In your mouth and throat you also have saliva, which serves a similar role. Inhaled bacteria, viruses, fungi and dust are trapped by the mucous and saliva, which is then either expelled or swallowed and digested.

First, let's look at when it   performed: A heart attack in the past isn't likely to meet any of those indications unless it's causing symptoms now such as angina or anginal equivalents. Generally, once ischemia (reduced blood flow) has killed heart tissue, reopening the artery with angioplasty won't accomplish anything. The tissue is dead and can't be revived. This last point is made in the same link as above. Emphasis is mine. Angioplasty also has a number of contraindications when it won't be performed even when the heart attack is ongoing. These include: A lot of this is complicated language understood mainly only by cardiologists, but it boils down to saying that angioplasty will be performed only when it can save heart muscle from dying or when it can relieve chest pain or other symptoms, when the procedure is physically possible (eg, the arteries are large enough), and when it has a practical chance of extending the patient's life (eg, a terminal patient with days or weeks to live probably would not benefit from angioplasty).	2015-08-05 21:15:27Z	Carey Gregory	1

It is connected to a malfunction in the neurons which turn the signals from the ear into the perception of hearing. The usual cause is that the inner ear is damaged, and nobody knows how to repair this organ. You have to accept the idea that it will almost certainly stay with you for the rest of your life.  The German association for ENT, Head and Neck surgery   as:  The goal of the existing therapies is not to remove the tinnitus, but to lower it to grade II or I. They usually consist of a combination of relaxation techniques, mental relaxation (meditation, cognitive therapy) which allows you to concentrate on other things without being bothered by tinnitus, and music therapy, which trains your auditory perception to discriminate more between sounds and focus less on the tinnitus sound. After a successful therapy, sufferers of permanent tinnitus can tolerate the tinnitus well, sometimes forgetting it for hours at a time, while sufferers of episodic tinnitus can have less frequent episodes. The subjective loudness of the tinnitus can also go down.  Tinnitus itself is not treatable, but most of its consequences are, for example sleep problems, depression, speech understanding difficulties, hyperacusis or tensions in the neck area. If they occur, don't hesitate to seek help for them.  Tinnitus requires specialized cross-disciplinary knowledge in ENT, neurology and psychiatry. "Standard" ENT doctors are rarely well versed in tinnitus. Your first place to go with acute tinnitus is still the ENT, who can confirm the diagnosis and exclude other, more pressing problems. In the long term, you are much better off going to a clinic specializing in inner ear disorders, or even a pure tinnitus clinic. This type of clinic can also diagnose other, not yet detected types of inner ear damage. Find out if there is a local patient group for tinnitus or hearing loss, and ask them which clinic to go to. They can give you the best regional advice. Also consider becoming a member of your national association for tinnitus, such as   or  . They are an excellent source for news about promising research.  As far as I'm aware,   about tinnitus is not yet translated into English, but I can recommend it for anybody who reads German. It is written by the director of a clinic specializing in inner ear disorders and his senior physician who is a tinnitus patient himself. If you are researching literature on tinnitus, don't fall for the popular books which promise a miracle healing. I have never met a patient for whom they delivered. 	2015-08-05 20:49:49Z	rumtscho	3
1789	7324	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7324	While there is no single treatment to tinnitus as a variety of reasons can cause it some kinds of therapy might help ease symptoms. Tinnitus is a symptom and not a disease so it is helpful to pinpoint the underlying issue itself and then address it. My tinnitus started after I was on a anti-depressants course(Escitalopram Oxalate) and as soon as I found out one night my ears won't stop ringing I discontinued the drug. The following weeks I experienced natural side-effects of the medication and since then the tinnitus has been there. Now I believe my issue is not with the ear but the auditory cortex itself: the part of the brain associated with processing audio signals. Overexcitation of neurons caused by hearing loss over certain frequencies so the neurons associated with those frequencies start generating their own signals and you get tinnitus or even chronic anxiety/depression. Acoustic neuromodulation is a nice effective therapy to combat this type of tinnitus. Watch this to understand what it is:  The other kind of tinnitus is caused by mechanical issues to the ear and those might require a deep investigation and surgical intervention of the inner ear which I don't believe is safe. Pulsatile tinnitus is one of the variants where there is some blood vessel pressing to the inner ear causing a pulsing sound signal as blood is pumped by the heart.  My best advice would be to find out what caused your tinnitus in the first place and then treat it. Of course while it may not be completely treatable you can still train yourself to ignore it and proceed on with life. If you constantly worry about it ( ) then you're not helping.	2016-07-06 19:00:45Z	Weezy	2

Your question does not give enough information to provide a "curve", as this has many variants including the produc you use, skin temperature(!), humidity and other influences.  Read product instructions. These patches are generally made to provide a more or less constant uptake of the used drug, so in a perfect world with given temperature, humidity and skin type it should be more or less constant for some hours. The amount of hours depend on the specific product.  As you seem to assume right the effect decreases after some time, so if you change every 12 hours you may get more effect than every 24 hours, but most producs seem to be made to work for 24 hours.  In conclusion, if you use a 24-hour patch it won't make much difference to apply it every 12h, because the drug intake/hour should be more or less constant.

Synthesis seems to be that HEPA results to significant reduction in the particulate matter in the air but the objective effects on health remains to be shown. : HEPA filtration resulted to better air quality. In subjects exposed to traffic-related matter, use of HEPA resulted to lower level of C-reactive protein indicating less intensive systemic inflammation.

In the summer I adjust the intake of vitamin D supplements to take into account the amount I get from the Sun, in the winter I get the entire dose of 7000 IU/day from supplements (I then take 10,000 IU/day, 5 times per week). Note that such doses and calcidiol levels  . I don't exercise in a gym, I only exercise outside. This helps to build immunity against cold viruses early on when they are still evolving to become next winter's scourge. When you run, your lungs filter the air less, allowing viruses to enter your body more easily. Also, you are inhaling an enormous amount of air up to ten times more per unit time compared to being in rest. Chances are then that your immune system will already have encounter the cold viruses that will later mutate a bit and then make many people ill.	2015-07-31 03:37:59Z	Count Iblis	-3

You may want to have your child tested for IgA deficiency if that hasn't been done yet as it's also linked to other potential issues.  None of it is terribly scary things, but things you want to be aware of nonetheless.  IgA deficiency is actually relatively common, effecting about 1 in 500 people.

1710	1715	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1715	I also suffer from similar symptoms. For about 3 years, I have been going to the (fighting) gym every other day and training for hours. At home, I would do my own exercises as well.
By the end of 2-3 years, I had lots of energy throughout the day and had no real issues with sleep. (Before the 3 years is a WHOLE other story of mostly unhealthiness). About a year ago, I stopped going to the gym, mostly due to financial reasons. I knew once I stopped for a while, it would be incredibly hard to get back into it (especially the self-motivation part). I continued to slack off and now I do not exercise nearly as much as I used to, my cardio is completely non-existent, and my energy levels are at an extreme low. 
I come home from work, and I do NOTHING for a few hours, get more tired, and fall asleep. This is not helpful at all because I end up waking up in the middle of the night, trying to find something to eat, and then am too tired to do anything and doze in and out of sleep until work in the morning. Rinse & Repeat. My digestive system has NEVER been good my whole life, but recently has been acting up a LOT more than usual.
I too have been eating VERY LITTLE each day and feeling relatively okay about it. I too am a programmer. I have not gone to see a doctor yet (this time), but I am knowledgeable in many areas of human psychology, exercise physiology, anatomy, neuroscience, cog science, etc. and I am usually able to identify signs and symptoms and self-diagnose very well. I can tell you, I definitely have the signs of depression without the overwhelming sadness (like you described) but am yet reserved on outright calling it depression just yet. First of all, just because the doctor mentions something about "pills to treat depression", doesn't mean you HAVE TO take them or go that route. You can visit the doctors and have all your discussions without things leading to pills, and it will still help you by providing you loads of insight, especially from a medical perspective. I personally am very against taking medicine for anything and only do so if absolutely required.   This means, you will cover up your symptoms, but old and new problems can continue to arise. Sometimes, we have no other choices, but when and if I do, I make the choice to stay away from relying on external means of balancing myself. Like any drug, your mind AND body can become addicted or dependent, whether physically or not. Exercise is extremely important for mental health and overall human health. There is just too much material on this to explain it fully, but regular exercise and regular sleeping patterns are so crucial to all the neurochemicals and cycles going on in your body that this would be the first thing I focus on. Take vitamin supplements if you do not eat well enough to get all of your nutrients. I'm not too sure on the Iron and how it could affect you in your current situation, but I am a huge fan of red meat and I do not feel lack of iron contributes to my situation. I suggest you hit the gym and exercise regularly. Draining your energy will only make your body realize it needs more energy. Unless you have any other health conditions that would limit your exercise habits, there should be no cause for concern. Dont go TOO HARD all at once, start slow and work your way up in a safe and controlled manner. If you get EXTREMELY tired, then stop and rest. Maybe get checked for diabetes. (my dad has it so I need to be on the lookout too). Hope it gives you something to compare to.
My plans are to get back into the gym and fight it out until I feel better. If this does not feel like its working, I would probably take a visit to the doctors for some medical insight and continue doing what I do on my own.	2015-07-27 20:46:14Z	agent provocateur	3

However, what has the most real-world potential of being harmful to your ear is most likely what comes out of those ear buds. 
E.g. ear buds are being used to listen to very loud music/sounds. Long term use of ear buds can also cause sensitivity in and around your ear, causing some pain when touched or upon pressure. The size and shape of the ear buds would help to mitigate this, but not everyone's ears are the same exact size and shape.	2015-07-27 20:54:38Z	agent provocateur	1
1706	1711	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1711	First of all, just to be clear: IVF-associated twinning and “tripletting” are most commonly of the   (“fraternal”) variety. You appear to be asking about   (“identical”) twinning given the reference to “splitting the egg.”  I will provide a brief overview of both.  ("fraternal") twins (and higher multiples) occur because more than one egg is fertilized. This is very common during the in vitro process because the ovaries are stimulated using medications, as opposed to the normal menstrual cycle where usually only one egg is release. Because multiple birth pregnancies have considerably higher rates of both maternal and fetal complications,   IVF centers and mothers together have to make a decision weighing the risk of multiple embryo transfer with the benefits of improved probability of successful live birth. In some countries, there are laws against transferring more than one embryo, but in the United States this varies by center, and overall about 35 percent of IVF pregnancies are twins, with 7-8 % being triplets.    ("identical") twins occur because an early embryo divides after fertilization. This results in two embryos with identical DNA (hence the terminology and phenotype - “identical”). These have also been shown to be more common in IVF pregnancies, although the degree of over-representation is considerably less marked compared to the situation with dizygotes. The mechanism is also less clear.  
Monozygotic twins (and higher multiples) have markedly increased rates of every pattern of fetal and perinatal mortality, overall between four and seven times the rate compared to singletons.  This may be in part due to the fact that the process of splitting is itself a “deformity” of sorts that tends to cluster with other deformities. It is also the case that monozygotic multiple births at times share, to varies degrees, portions of the placental sac (  and at times also  ). Mono-amniotic are susceptible to umbilical cord entanglement, which can lead to serious complications. Those that do not share an amniotic sac ( ,  ) are susceptible to something called Twin-twin Transfusion Syndrome wherein blood is shunted from one twin to the other via vascular connections between the placentas. This can lead to severe anemia of the “donor” twin and polycythemia (overload of red blood cells) in the “recipient”, both of which carry complications.   You asked:  Your goal appears to to increase the chance of monozygotic twinning.  Although it has been shown   that certain factors do increase this chance (advanced maternal age and some technical considerations during the fertilization step), because of the above considerations about complications during monozygotic multiple embryo pregnancies, this is considered an   outcome during IVF. As such, IVF centers are unlikely to do anything likely to increase this chance.	2015-07-27 01:11:09Z	Susan	8

1704	1719	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1719	Many sleeping pills are addictive.
Many non-addictive sleeping pills can be mentally addictive. If you do not mind using sleeping pills for the rest of your life, then that is a perfectly fine choice. Otherwise, you may want to consider other options first. Exercise will help. Use up your energy and your body will WANT sleep. Exercise is key to your body's cycles. 
Your circadian rhythm (sleeping cycle) is largely affected by light. Particularly, artificial light gives off a lot of light in the frequency range that causes your body to think its NOT time to sleep and will screw up your cycles. When you know you have time to sleep, stay away from staring at computer screens as much as possible. 
Stay away from stimulants. i.e. caffeine or whatever else you may use throughout the day/night. The huge factor here is that you said you have no official known work hours and you go in whenever they ask you to.  If that means that you never know when you might have a good 6-8 hours of sleeping time, then there really is no way to "fix your cycles" since it is a constantly moving unknown. Sleeping pills   be the only realistic answer in that case.  However, if you are able to figure out times when you know you will be off work for a certain number of hours more often than not, then you have a good chance of trying to fix your sleeping cycle.	2015-07-27 21:31:31Z	agent provocateur	3

1697	1698	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1698	Aside from its wonderful taste, green tea (obtained from the plant  , (L.) Kuntze, Theaceae) contains caffeine, and this might be the reason for your possible addiction. Studies have shown that caffeine withdrawal symptoms exist and that their intensity is correlated to the amount of caffeine that was being used previously, and the frequency of use. That being said, tea contains other ingredients: catechins, flavonoids, caffeic acid derivatives etc. While tea has been proven to have many beneficial effects (there have been extensive clinical studies in China and Japan, which have proven that tea consumption is correlated with decreased risk of some types of cancer) Why? There are two main reasons: Aside from being addictive, too much caffeine can cause an overdose. Possible symptoms are: restlessness, tremor and elevated reflex excitability. An overdose can also cause headaches or dizziness, abnormal hearth rhythms, dehydration or sleep problems. According to PDR overdose occurs in doses corresponding to 300 mg of caffeine (approximately 5 cups of tea as a beverage). Even in "regular" amounts, caffeine can affect blood pressure, so people with these problems ought to be careful.
Tea is, of course, not the only source of caffeine, so when deciding on the daily amount of tea, all sources of caffeine should be taken into account. Tannines in tea precipitate iron. If this happens in your digestive system it means that iron becomes insoluble, and cannot be absorbed. This decreases the effective uptake by your body, while regular loss via excretion and  desquamation remains the same, so over time you start having less and less iron at your body's disposal, which can lead to anemia. There were several studies that have proven this effect - many were epidemiological and observational. There was a clinical trial involving patients with haemochromatosis which also proved that drinking tea reduced iron absorption from the GIT. Possible solutions: Drinking decaf tea might solve the first problem, but won't solve the second. Moderation is the key. Also, drinking tea with or right after meals (especially those which are the greatest source of iron) should be avoided most of the times. Drinking tea is an indulgent ritual for many, so perhaps switching one or two cups a day for a herbal tea might help. An interesting aside: PDR cites studies which have proven that tea mouthwashes can reduce growth of some cavity-associated bacteria and reduce formation of plaque (the 2nd goes for oolong). But tanines can deposit on your teeth causing them to turn yellow, so rinsing your teeth with tea is a double-edged sword. References:	2015-07-25 12:08:19Z	Lucky	6
1697	12350	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12350	I agree with Lucky's answer but have one thing to add. Tea is also rich in Flouride, which is put in toothpaste to help prevent cavities.  The reason you have to spit and not swallow toothpaste is because flouride can have adverse affects if taken in too large amounts. So getting too much flouride, especially if you are using already flouridated water can also be a problem. 
A suggestion,  use the same tea-bag twice.  Many times you can still get a good flavor of tea the second time around, and this would cut in half the amount of flouride, caffeine, and Tannines you consume.	2017-05-18 10:19:30Z	Virginia	0

I´ll try sum up those long answers in the Biology Stack and present them more clearly. Major factor influencing to the presumed effects of any drug is the first pass effect  . That means that every substance taken orally must absorb from intestine to the surrounding blood stream. All this blood with all absorbed substance (incl. sugar, fat, protein from food) are transported to liver. Liver then processes all the substances in the blood. There are dozen of enzymes in the liver which processes the substances in the blood. One enzyme family particularly processes all the foreign substances (inc. drugs)  . Liver aims to remove all foreign substances from the blood, but some of the absorbed substance always escapes the liver to the systemic circulation. Only those molecules which escape liver without processing are transported to the tissues and afterwards can bind to their receptors in the tissue thus eliciting the proposed actions (ie. reducing pain). Enzymes in the liver processes the foreign molecules in a way that they are secreted to bile and eventually to feces. For example enzyme CYP2E1 processes paracetamol  . There are three different CYP-enzymes which processes diclofenac molecules  . And for naproxen two CYP-enzymes exist  .  One major reason why diclofenac does not help you but naproxen does, is the different action of these enzymes. DNA in our cell nucleus defines how each protein is expressed in our body. These enzymes are these proteins. In your case it seems that enzymes responsible for processing diclofenac are expressed in large number in your liver, resulting to very low concentration of diclofenac molecules in your bloodstream. In other word the level of diclofenac in your blood stream is out of therapeutic window to elicit any responses in the body  . In contrary, your liver may express enzymes responsible for the processing of naproxen very little and thus many naproxen molecules may escape liver to the systematic circulation resulting the therapeutic level to elicit tissue responses. This only one player in this topic, although very important and influential. There are also factor influencing after the first pass effect (receptor, expression of genes responsible for receptors, binding affinity ec.) 	2015-07-29 11:30:09Z	arkiaamu	2

If you also need a shorter answer take this: Naproxene and Aspirine do not only 'directly' relieve pain, they also work antiinflammatory. In many cases the inflammation itself causes pain, so these drugs have different targets to work.  Tramadol is not antiinflammatory, neither is paracetamol.  You are not the only on feeling a difference between naproxene and diclofenac. Read the answer from arkiaamu for some ideas why. Reasons are multi-factorial including some personal things like genetics and gene-expression.   Please note that naproxene and aspirine have dangerous adverse effects (gastrointestinal bleeding).

1667	1675	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1675	You should not skip any pills when taking oral contracptives. Breakthrough bleeding is not uncommon, especially early on, and the pill is still effective at preventing pregnancy. You should, however, report breakthrough bleeding; your doctor may want to change your pill.  Breakthrough Bleeding is one of the most common reasons for women to stop taking their pill. However, it is still an effective contraceptive when taken regularly. An adjustment of one of the components of your pill can stop breakthrough bleeding. However, some doctors will ask an oral contraceptive user to use additional protection while using an antibiotic.  The reasoning that antibiotics might interfere with the effectiveness of COCs revolves around the antibiotic decreasing steroid hormone’s plasma concentrations by hepatic microsomal enzyme induction or inhibition, interference with enterohepatic circulation of COC metabolites, interference with absorption from the GI tract, competition between two drugs for the same metabolizing enzyme, alterations in plasma protein binding, induction of an opposite physiologic effect, or increased urinary or fecal excretion of the contraceptive. The strongest evidence is for rifabutin and rifampin: a significant decrease in the hormonal levels was noted in women taking rifampin even after    Dirithromycin slightly decreased plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, with questionable clinical importance. A recent study in the Netherlands   find a relationship between the use of antibiotics and breakthrough pregnancy in a population-based   database; also, individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol when they take certain antibiotics, notably tetracycline and penicillin derivatives.   Because of earlier studies, anecdotal reports, and the above (it's not possible to identify whose levels will drop with antibiotic use), a cautious approach is advised. Physicians and pharmacists (80-90% of both) still lean towards believing that broad-spectrum antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of COCs, and continue to advise the use of back-up contraception.  The tide is shifting, however, as new studies come out. Here are a few excerpts of recent studies: Since dermatologists treat acne with antibiotics, and a significant percentage of these patients are young women of child-bearing age, they certainly have a vested interest in knowing if this is true. So, the answer is (except with your noted exceptions) the penicillin-class antibiotics   However, one unwanted pregnancy is one pregnancy too many, and the use of a back-up method is not a huge deal (just ~14 days). Until more and larger studies demonstrate a lack of interaction between most antibiotics and COCs, this will likely be the advice people continue to receive. When you look at the risk to benefit ratio of back-up, it's probably the wisest course for people prescribed a short course of antibiotics. It is more significantly problematic for people prescribed continuous antibiotic use for acne, Crohn's and other conditions/illnesses.

1660	1677	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1677	Many substances that can be found in blood are distributed into saliva (but in different concentrations) so saliva as a biological material can be used for a wide range of tests. All of these have their advantages and disadvantages, and many are still not routinely used. The important thing to have in mind is that, in blood, substances are bound to plasma proteins to some extent, and only the free (unbound) fraction can pass into saliva, so the concentration in saliva is proportional to the concentration of free substance in blood.  Let's have a look at some possible applications: Monitoring the concentrations of certain medicines can be useful, and saliva is a good material for monitoring neutral substances, weak acids or weak bases. Saliva is often used in  , metabolic phenotyping (determination of activity of metabolic enzymes in a patient), compliance monitoring and determining the free fraction of the medicine. These are all used in highly individalised approaches to treatment, and are not routinely used. These can be found if you visit the websites of some laboratories that do these tests, and see what they offer. Some of those that I have found include: (by testing I mean - detecting presence and determining the concentration). This procedure is definitely non-invasive, and as such it can be very convenient when multiple samples have to be drawn at certain time periods. This is often the case with steroid hormones, and this is why saliva can be preferred to blood - sampling saliva is less invasive than venipuncture.  On the other hand there are some analytical limitations: saliva is a complex matrix and some substances in it interfere with analysis; the concentration of tested substances is usually low in saliva, so method sensitivity is an issue. These sensitive methods are often advanced and sophisticated, and may be quite costly.   There are other options which are being used or studied (some are successful and entering diagnostic use, some require further research): I take it that your question was out of curiosity. Clinical applications of these tests, whether they are necessary and cost-effective, and other clinical justification issues are up to a physician to determine in each individual case.

While the basic recommendation is to drink 2-3 liters (In the US, the recommendation is "8x8", or 8 8oz glasses of water per day), all fluids actually count towards that total. While making koolaid may not be as healthy as plain water, the water content remains the same, and will eventually be used in the body as such. This also includes fluid from food, such as apples, watermelon, tomatoes, etc. Anything that has a fluid component in it will count towards your daily fluid intake needs.

I take my blood pressure several times a year, always 3 or more times at one sitting.  I notice something amazing, and that is how much your blood pressure can move around within just a 5 minute interval.  Divergences of more than 20 points are common for systolic pressure and 10 to 15 points for diastolic pressure.   The first time you take the pressure, you may have a high reading.  You wait a few minutes, and you make a conscious effort to calm yourself (thinking about relaxing on a sunny beach, etc...).  And, you get a lot lower reading.  I have learned to take my blood pressure several times as mentioned, and take the average as the representative measure for that date.  By doing so, I have noticed that my blood pressure has remained perfectly stable over the years.

I am not completely sure what is meant with this. It might be giving you information on how to have a healthy pregnancy (what to do, what to avoid), or on how to deal with problems with the fetus if they occur. I'd need more information on this.

Over the course of 36 weeks (from initial visit to estimated due date), a normal schedule for a healthy is one visit every month until the last trimester, where visits might be every two and later every week (when going over the due date, for example). One visit during month 3, 4, 5, 6 = 4 visits. Every two weeks during months 7, 8, and 9= about 7,which works out to more or less 11.

Unfortunately there isn't really good research about how long to go outside to get enough. Some sources suggest that 30 minutes twice a week is good enough.  AST and the IGF growth factor tests mean that the doc is checking for liver and/or pituitary gland issues that could be affecting your growth or overall health. It's entirely possible that these are out of range and not indicative of a problem. Assuming that you are healthy aside from the Vit-D, we will only consider sleep. There is quite a bit of evidence for shift workers having increased rates of certain illnesses. Unfortunately, it is hard to say whether this is because of the actual timing of the work or because of the interruptions in sleep that tend to be more prevalent among people who sleep in this way.

Also, although the illness is present all the time, the symptoms don't have to be. The time periods (which can be quite long) when the person doesn't have symptoms and feels well is called remission. When the symptoms appear this is called exacerbation or relapse. Many chronic illnesses that can't be cured can be well-managed and the consequences can be mitigated. There are other categories between chronic and acute:  - which can refer to duration (between acute and chronic, but closer to acute), to severity (often duration and severity combined: moderate) or it is sometimes used to denote a condition in a person who appears to be clinically well (although there are better terms for this, IMO). subchronic - usually longer than acute, but limited in time (duration of illness is for about a year). Subacute and subchronic (along with acute and chronic) are also used in toxicology to refer to classification of toxicity according to duration of exposure.

Since the article mentions clinical trials, and the numbers 90, 95 and 99 are characteristic, my best guess would be that this refers to the  , a statistical term which (long story short) describes the probability that the conclusion from your study that the tested medicine is better than the other is correct. So, why not just say it like that? (We'll get back to that.) There is another part of this article: This sentence is rather imprecise, and therefore sounds a bit boastful. When the study is double-blind it means that neither the patient nor the researcher knows which patient is receiving the tested substance, and which something else, until the end of the trial. So one group of patients receives the substance being tested (test group) and the other either an alternative substance used for the same condition (control group) or an inert substance, i.e. placebo (placebo group). The first sort of trials (where you compare a new substance to an old one) are called   trials. Here you can test whether your new substance is better that the old one (superiority trial), that the new substance isn't worse than the old one (non-inferiority trial) and that they are equivalent (equivalence trials). You can do something similar by comparing your substance with placebo in a   study, but here you would want your substance definitely to be better than placebo. The statement that something is "the best in the market"   that the substance/preparation is tested against (all) others on the market, but it doesn't specifically say so, does it? What's more, which other products has it been compared to, exactly? If they are not allowed to name competitor's brands, surely they could give the chemical names of other substances used as controls, or at least say   have they compared theirs to. (Note that usually one comparison is one separate clinical study. More studies -> more expenses for the company). Why haven't they addressed these issues? We can't know. Can it be that the explanation is tailored for everyone to understand? Or that some things one wouldn't boast about were just omitted?  I can only suggest that you ask a health care professional from the field, whether they have some experience with the product.

Furthermore, good sleep is about both quantity and quality. It is best to get a sufficient amount of high-quality sleep every night. Bottom Line: Good sleep helps maintain blood sugar control and promote a healthy weight. Poor sleep can disrupt important metabolic hormones.	2016-10-28 18:23:13Z	Prince	0

Also, from the point of view of a yoga practitioner, I would suggest that sleeping on the stomach will put more pressure on the abdomen and chest during sleep, making the organs and lungs work harder during what should be a parasympathetic cycle. The body cushion systems will also alleviate this too. 	2016-09-27 06:06:51Z	LoggedIn	1

First, are different yet similar bacteria better or worse for people? Clearly yes; with various types of   being common and usually benign inhabitants, but   causing severe problems. Second, can directed evolution coax a bad type of bacteria into being a less harmful type? Also clearly yes: this is being done all the time in the biofuels industry to create bacteria with specific abilities to break down and reform materials into fuel. Third, can such improved bacteria be used to crowd out the bad bacteria? Again, yes:   is (see the name) a difficult-to-control gut inhabitant. Classic treatment with antibiotics has not been very effective, but transplanting good gut flora with   (FMT) seems to be very effective in the limited studies so far. The trouble is when you want to combine them all. FMT is still controversial, because it's difficult to control exactly what gets transplanted, and we don't completely (or even mostly) understand the functionality of the gut biota. What if a transplant recipient goes downhill in an unexpected way: was it the fault of the transplant? It may be tough to tell, but lawyers could make enormous amounts of money on the question. Now, if you're working with a   bacteria, the consequences could be even harder to predict, and the legal fault could be even clearer. (Plus there's the "ick" factor of poop transplantation.) To summarize, the basic idea is good, but the proof is in the implementation. 	2015-07-17 11:57:27Z	Daniel Griscom	2

In principle, this is what happens with any vaccine using an   virus or bacteria - they have been directed through essentially forced evolution to lose some of their properties that effect virulence - how sick they make you when you get infected. Some examples of this include the   or the type of   used in developing countries. These are both viral examples, but bacterial examples exist, including tuberculosis. In a grander sense outside vaccination research, this is theoretically possible, but has some complications. The first is whether or not you can actually get attenuation. There are some microbes (norovirus and   come to mind) that are very hard to culture, so this kind of directed evolution is difficult. And, if successful, you'd have to reintroduce them in a setting where the "full strength" microbes exist, and if those full strength microbes have a selective advantage in the environment, the engineered strains are unlikely to be successful in the long term.	2015-07-17 19:55:18Z	Fomite	0

Its bad reputation was based on a very bad scientific study which everyone (including American Heart Association and various governments) took seriously. It is not a particularly healthy form of fat except that some saturated fats handle heat better than some other types of fat we substituted them with. So for cooking it might be better to use saturated fat than some of the alternatives. Again, there is no study that I am aware of that proves conclusively that saturated fats are better for you.

1582	3363	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3363	A number of studies have shown that in early period (within 2-3 hours of onset of chest pain), thrombolysis is as good or even better than primary angioplasty:  Thrombolytic therapy (clot busting medicines e.g. tPA, also called fibrinolytics since they lyse fibrin strands of thrombi or clots) has major advantage in ease of administration. They are administered via intravenous route and hence can be give by nurses or paramedical personnel. The drug travels in the blood stream to reach arteries of the heart and lyses the thrombus (clot) there. Thrombolysis treatement can be given in ambulance while patients are being transported to hospitals or even at patient's home to save time. Tenecteplase, a type of thrombolytic therapy, can be given just as a bolus injection and does not even need infusion. Early after onset of heart attack, the thrombus is soft and possibly smaller in size and hence is more easily lysed by thrombolytic agents. On the other hand, primary angioplasty needs a fully functioning cardiac catheterization laboratory which costs a lot and are available only in tertiary centers. Trained cardiologists and cath lab technician/nursing staff are needed to perform primary angioplasty. The access has to be through high pressure artery rather than simple vein for thrombolysis. The procedure itself is very complex since the coronary arteries of the heart have to be hooked, wires, balloon catheters, thrombo-suction devices and stents have to be passed into them to open the block caused by thrombus. The logistics of availablity are difficult, especially at nights and on weekends. Hence, the costs are also much more with primary angioplasty.  Because of all these reasons, we should not ignore the role of thrombolytic therapy in patients presenting early after onset of chest pain in acute heart attack. For patients presenting late, primary angioplasty has been shown to be more beneficial than thrombolytic treatment, presumably because the thrombus become more extensive and firm with time and is not easily lysed wih thrombolytic agents ( ).	2015-10-08 04:05:22Z	rncardio	2

1579	7394	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7394	Prolactin is a peptide hormone that, in addition to modulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, functions as a cytokine in the immune system and as a growth factor in the vascular system amongst many other functions. According to Wikipedia: How prolactin suppresses GnRH, the mechanism through which hyperprolactinemia causes hypogonadism, is unknown. Many of prolactin's other functions may not necessarily be influenced by blood serum levels, as prolactin acts in a paracrine and autocrine, in addition to an endocrine, manner. The positive outcomes from normalizing hypogonadism should outweigh any negative effects of reducing prolactin levels. Androgen deficiency in males can cause osteoporosis, a series weakening of the bones. Of course, as more is known about the function of elevated prolactin levels, this opinion may change. Surprisingly, serum prolactin below physiological levels can cause many of the symptoms that high levels can. Prolactin acts as a weak gonadotropin by itself, and enhances the effect of leuteinizing hormone at testosterone-producing cells in males. Hypoprolactinemia can lead to hypogonadism and osteoporosis, just like in hyperprolactinemia. However, in cases of hyperprolactinemia, cabergoline often does not completely reduce prolactin to normal levels, anyway. The side effects of cabergoline itself are probably more important. as there are known cases of valvular heart disease in doses used to treat Parkinson's. Inflammation and fibrosis of various tissues can also occur.	2016-07-12 19:29:45Z	Andrew McKinlay	2

The heart has 4 chambers that alternately relax and fill, then squeeze and empty. The arterial pulse is from the left side of the heart. Oxygenated blood enters into the left atrium, and from there it is pushed into the left ventricle.

Beware that even if the male doesn't ejaculate you can still get pregnant or get diseases if you do not use condoms. Also you can get pregnant or a disease even if the first time, the second or whatever. Always do safe sex. All pregnancy tests look for the presence of hCG. hCG is short for "human chorionic gonadotropin" a hormone produced during pregnancy. To get accurate results, take a pregnancy test 12-14 days after ovulation and retest after you miss your period if you get a negative result. Approximately 90 percent of pregnant women will get a positive result the first day after a missed period, but 10 percent of women will test negative even though they are pregnant. Your doctor may be able to perform a blood test that can pick up hCG in smaller amounts than a urine test. However, even blood tests cannot tell you whether or not you're pregnant until at least six to eight days after you ovulate, because hCG is not produced until implantation. The soonest you can take a pregnancy test, even if you go to your doctor, is seven days after you ovulate.	2015-07-15 02:55:19Z	anongoodnurse	-1
1565	1575	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1575	There are many facts to consider in answering the question, but in effect, yes, one can calculate the chances. Things to consider: Latex condoms are somewhat more effective than polyurethane condoms, mostly due to breakage and slippage. However, since in your scenario the condom doesn't break (and we assume it didn't slip), breakage or slippage would not be a problem in the calculations. For this scenario, we'll use the effectiveness of a latex condom. Male condoms remain a highly effective contraceptive method when used correctly. Latex condoms are 98% effective, meaning that two out of 100 women correctly using male condoms as a means of contraception will become pregnant  . Use of out-of-date condoms, spermicidal jelly or the wrong kind of lubricant with latex condoms, etc. decreases the efficacy of condoms. In this scenario, we'll assume a not-expired condom, applied properly (not applied and taken off and reapplied, or used more than once, etc.) (Please note, however, it only takes one "successful" mating to become pregnant.) A menstrual cycle begins on the first day of your period and ends the day before the next period begins. Most women will experience some variation in the length of cycles throughout their lives; normally, though, a cycle is between 21 and 35 days.  Ovulation usually occurs about 14 days before the next cycle begins, but it can vary. If you have a short cycle (say, 24 days) and your bleeding lasts 5 days, this means you likely ovulate around day 10; add one day for every day that your cycle is longer (so in a 35 day cycle, you will likely ovulate on day 21.) Pregnancies occur within a 6 day fertile window. This “fertile window” is comprised of the five days before ovulation and the day of ovulation itself. Sex must occur on one of these days (and, yes, it can be only once. It makes no difference if it's the first time or the 50th.) This is because sperm can live for up to five days, traveling to meet the ovulated egg.  This graph shows the probability of women being in their fertile window on a specific day in their cycle. If a woman has a 28 day cycle (the most common), and stops bleeding on day five, on day 6, there is a less than 20% chance that of her being in her fertile window. Even with ejaculation, a latex condom used correctly is between 98% and 99% effective (odds of pregnancy: .02); if the woman has a 28 day cycle, the odds of being in her window of fertility on day 6 is ~15% (.15). Doing the math, .15 x .02 = .0003, which means she has   a 3 in 10,000 chance of becoming pregnant from this interaction. Because of the lack of ejaculation, the chance is reduced by a factor of 10 (to account for sperm in the pre-ejaculate), so the chance is approximately 3 in 100,000.  That is a very small chance of being pregnant. As a way to put that into perspective, that is only (roughly) 15 times more likely than a person's chance of being killed by an asteroid.  Though the chance is very small, it is not zero. For this reason, one can take a urine test to reassure oneself as soon as the 28th day.

You can do daily calorie restriction, or you can restrict your calories with fasting in various intermittent fasting protocols.  For the benefits of restricting calories, there seems to be several studies showing benefits in longevity and health. However, the fact that restricting calories will in most cases lead to weight loss, it is hard to determine whether it is the restriction itself that has benefits (and the hormonal changes that occur in the body due to restriction) or simply from the weight loss itself.  This study, which is done on rodents, show that there are changes on the cellular level that can increase the lifespan of rodents:  This study shows that several age-related diseases can decrease with long-term calorie restriction. However, this study discusses the effects it has on yeast, worms, flies and rodents, and links these hypothetically to primates:  This is a similar study as the one above.

1561	3945	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3945	I have a condition similar to epilepsy, that has caused me to experience a number of seizures over time (ranging from simple partial seizures to full convulsive tonic-clonic seizures, also called "grand mal" seizures). This means that over the past few years, I have taken numerous tests, including EEGs. The basic principles of an   (also sometimes called an electroencephalogram) are well-known and can be looked up with ease. However, they do have specific parts designed to test specific potential triggers - you don't simply lie down in a darkened room for half an hour with wires strapped to your head. One of these trigger tests involves a strobe light. The patient, lying in a darkened room, is instructed to close their eyes, if they have not already been doing so as per the instructions of the doctor, nurse, or technician in charge. A small light - sometimes jokingly referred to as a "bug light" - is then placed over the patient's eyes, at a distance of about one foot. It is a compound device, consisting of many small LEDs. The person in charge then begins the test, which goes like so: This pattern repeats for some time, with the flashing getting quicker and quicker. It doesn't take long until it is impossible for the patient to tell whether the light is blinking or continuously shining, and even through closed eyelids, it is extremely bright. I've been told to not open my eyes during the test, as it could blind me. I don't know whether or not this is true, but I'm not keen to test it out any time soon. In someone with photosensitive epilepsy, this light might trigger some sort of seizure - of any strength - or at least increased brain activity. While this has never happened to me, it does happen to people. I wouldn't compare the experience to looking at bicycle lights like the ones you name, and for a few reasons: However, people with photosensitive epilepsy can have seizures when faced with lights less intense than the strobe lights I've been confronted with during EEGs (see the links). Those of us without photosensitive epilepsy should be fine; those with it might not. The bottom line? Yes, it's possible - under certain conditions. There have been some outcries over this - see  , for example - which has led to some changes. However, these cases occur when the lights are flashing pretty quickly - I haven't been able to find out average rates for bike lights, so any information there would be awesome - and when the person with epilepsy is relatively close to the lights. You don't necessarily have to be one foot away, but being a sensible distance from the bike would reduce the risk.	2015-12-03 22:44:34Z	HDE 226868	3
1558	1563	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1563	Perforated eardrums (or ruptured tympanic membranes) are a problem older than mankind. The majority of cases (reported/observed, ~80%) heal spontaneously with little residual hearing loss or other problems, usually in a few weeks. It is acceptable practice, therefore, to only observe traumatic TM perforations for healing. If you are still experiencing hearing loss, however, you should see an ear specialist (ear, nose and throat if in the US). They will determine if your hearing loss is due to a chronic perforation (one that has not healed itself), or middle-ear bone damage (or another possible cause) which occurred during the traumatic event. In most cases, there are surgical treatments. If the perforation is still present, a simple patch may be all that's needed. If a bone was injured, the surgery (bone repair or replacement) is more involved. Other injuries are treated dependent on case. Edited to add: During healing, care should be taken to keep water out of the ear (no swimming; baths or showers with protection from water in ear), and, though I have not seen a study on it, I would recommend against headphones except at a very low volume. The healing membrane isn't as tough as the original.

1557	1580	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1580	I think the centre of confusion for you is this question: The thing is, when a substance has a systemic effect (as opposed to local) it somehow has to get from the point where it is applied to the site of action. So, if one ingests something that affects the brain, it has to travel from the stomach to the head somehow - and substances do this via blood. So   Since blood reaches all parts of the body, so does the substance. We usually see most of its effects on one body part/organ, but it gets distributed (more or less) everywhere. To answer this, we must look into the process in which a substance passes from the blood stream to a tissue. This can be done by several mechanisms such as: diffusion, active transport, pinocitosis etc. For many   (substances foreign to our body) the route of transport is diffusion through cellular membranes.  
This means two things: And since:  we can see that, if we dissolve the same amount of a substance if different volumes (of blood e.g.) we will get different concentrations. Which brings us to the fact that  . Among other factors,  . The mass of the blood amounts for roughly 7% of our body mass, and the volume is proportional to that.* When the substance gets into a tissue, depending on its chemical structure it can: find a target protein and have an effect (note that this doesn't have to be the "desired" effect); it can dissolve in fat tissue; it can bind to proteins or other structures such as bones. Again the strength of these bonds depends on the chemical structure of the substance (among other factors) - it can bind reversibly and soon be on its way again or it can get deposed in a tissue it has chemical affinity for. We say that the substance is distributed to various compartments**. If the size of these compartments is bigger, than there is more "room" for the substance to be distributed, and potentially "stored", so to speak. Source: ref. 4 Things get complicated because many substances in our blood bind to plasma proteins (usually albumin) and the bound fraction is in equilibrium with the unbound (free fraction). It is only the free fraction of the substance that can diffuse through cell membranes (protein-substance complex is too large). Various substances have different binding potential, and they compete with each other for the same binding sites, and affect each other's kinetics. What's more, Liberation, Absorption and Distribution are followed by Metabolism and Excretion (the so called LADMER system). All these processes happen simultaneously after a (usually short) lag time.  This means that  . We calculate most of these factors in, based on information we get from testing on animals and from clinical trials, and use mathematical models and computer simulations to determine the dose and dosage which would achieve and maintain the concentration of a substance in blood in a certain range, and assume that this will have a predicted effect.  Another catch for controlled substances: there is significantly less data on the kinetics of these substances than on medicines (which are intended to cure or manage a disease). So the "calculations" are limited. On the other hand when these substances reach other parts of the body, and are metabolised, aside from their psychoactive effects they can affect other organs as well, causing liver or kidney failure, for instance. *Gender, body structure (especially lean body mass), age and other factors determine the exact mass and volume of the blood; still total body mass is strongly correlated with the amount of blood in the body. ** The division into compartments is theoretical, designed to make the calculations easier. It is based on the fact that the concentrations of a substance change differently in different compartments. In reality, all "compartments" are connected, and interact with each other at all times.  *** This explanation is simplified for general public. The equation above is for concentration in general. Blood concentration of a substance is never equal to simple quotient of the quantity and volume (remember to take point 2 and the catch into account). The theoretical term   or   is not equal to blood volume - it is calculated by considering various factors.  References:	2015-07-16 10:52:37Z	Lucky	12
1557	1574	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1574	The volume of blood that the psychoactive substance dissolves in will be roughly proportional to the lean body mass, making its concentration in the brain inversely proportional to lean body mass. If the substance were highly lipophilic then it might additionally partition into fat, further reducing its blood concentration. An exception to this   of the best way to calculate a dose of propofol adjusts the dose to depend on body weight, after excluding the weight of the fat. Propofol is a slightly polar phenol like the psilocin in Psilocybe mushrooms.	2015-07-15 20:09:32Z	Chris Jenks	-1
1549	4010	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4010	There have been quite a few studies on the influence of meal frequency, but usually they focus on weight loss.

So, you can hardly say that this is a dark place in Winter. I think the main problem is that in Winter the days are a bit shorter so it may still be dark when you go to work and when you're back it is already starting to get dark. You can then get some sunlight by going outside during the lunch break. You also mention the cold, but Toronto isn't so extremely cold that going outside would be a challenge even when properly dressed. This this means that you are not wearing good winter clothing and then suffer as a result of that. This makes you avoid going outside, which leads to the winter blues, which causes you to become reticent to going outside even more. And, of course,  if you feel like going to sleep, you may start to feel a bit chilly even while sitting in a properly heated room; the thought of going outside when it is -20 C alone may then make you stay indoors. You have to stop associating the feeling of cold with the outside conditions. What you feel is your own body heat, this is regulated by your own body thermostat. Simply dressing properly will allow you to use your own body heat to stay warm outside. The basics of how to dress well is quite simple: The key thing is to wear multiple layers, a lot of air will be trapped in between the layers which will give a good insulation against the cold. In the picture the girl is wearing rather light clothing appropriate for physical exertion in cold conditions. If you're going to be doing only light exertions, then the thermal underwear must be thicker different, e.g. you can use  .

However, there isn't a very strong correlation between refractive errors and headaches. I think it's safe to say that you might be projecting   onto your glasses. The only way to tell for sure is to switch to contacts and see if this relieves your activity-associated headaches. Headaches are very common and very often benign.

I also have tight frames and I tend to rest them on top of my ears to relieve the pressure it has on the temporals...i do believe like anywhere in the body,  prolonged pressure leads to decrease in circulation and if left for a while it can lead to ulcerations and necrosis.  This is why health care providers advise patients to move every 15 mins in chair and every 2 hours in bed.  I highly disagree with the palpable suture hypothesis one person mentioned above and fluid shifting made by whom I think is a practicing nurse... Fluid shifting is seen when there's a shift or change in osmotic pressure of intravascular osmolality that causes a shift in fluid from one compartment to another.  So on conclusion,  to alleviate the headache I would either take them off intermittently or buy frames that fit your facial structure.  Oh and if this headache is relate to something that you think isn't from the pressure of the glasses,  I would have ur health care provider examine it. 	2016-06-06 20:15:15Z	Matthew	1

If you look at the graph of the Probability of Conception vs. the Sperm Concentration, it shows that at more than 10 million sperm/mL (or around 30-40 million total sperm, estimating average semen volume to be 3-4 mL), the probability of conception per month quickly reaches a plateau, while at under this concentration there is a roughly linear drop in the probability of conception to zero at zero sperm.   shows a high variability in the number of sperm present in pre-ejaculate. Of the 28 men tested, only 12 produced any detectable sperm in their pre-ejaculate at all. Of these 12, the sample with the highest number of sperm contained 35 million (subject 17). If this man consistently produced this many sperm in his pre-ejaculate, I would estimate the probability of him causing conception per month as 35 million divided by 35 million (from above) multiplied by ten percent, i.e., 10%/month. In other words, it is possible, according to these studies, for pre-ejaculate to cause pregnancy. However, this evidence also suggests that some men, if their lack of sperm in pre-ejaculate is consistent, may be unable to cause pregnancy in this way.	2015-07-13 19:30:32Z	Chris Jenks	6

First, take an   example of an individual undergoing a full body CT scan at least once a year, every year after the age of 50. The upside is potentially detecting some forms of cancer early on (although the   says there are no benefits for healthy individuals). The downside is increased radiation itself increases your risk of cancer. In short, preventive cancer screenings may end up giving you cancer. The   reports that "the extra risk of any one person developing a fatal cancer from a typical CT procedure is about 1 in 2,000 (2). In contrast, the lifetime risk of dying from cancer in the U.S. population is about 1 in 5 (3)." Suppose the 1 in 2,000 figure is the average. Why are so many people concerned? A study in   found that a CT scan's "effective dose varied significantly within and across institutions, with a mean 13-fold variation between the highest and lowest dose for each study type." So, it's possible that, depending on where you go for your scan, you could be getting very different doses of radiation, and your lifetime risk will be affected by that. In addition to the dose of radiation, health care providers have many incentives for ordering tests when they aren't necessarily needed. A commonly cited reason is "defensive medicine" - a practice of ordering extra tests to avoid malpractice claims. However, there are other reasons as well, such as financial incentives, experience, training, etc. Fundamentally,   may have no additional health benefits, but may carry risks.  There is now a   campaign that partners with many professional medical organizations to develop guidelines and reduce over treatment, recognizing that it is an issue.	2015-07-22 03:54:26Z	Anna Zhilkova	3
1504	1522	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1522	To answer this question, first it might be useful to talk about how a vaccine actually works: basically, through introducing dead or relatively harmless (attenuated) versions of a virus or bacteria (or more recently, synthetic virus-like particles meant to mimic the outside of a virus), you induce a reaction by your immune system to defend itself. As your immune system remembers pathogens it's encountered before based usually on a protein encountered on the outside of the virus or bacteria (an antigen), when it encounters the real deal, it can defend itself. Which means the ability for a vaccine to work depends   on your body's ability to recognize the vaccine you were given and the pathogen you encounter as "the same". This, in turn, is a function of how fast the virus evolves. Some viruses, like influenza, have genomes that are very conducive to swapping between strains. This is known as  . Other viruses,  , have relatively rapid evolution brought on by methods of copying their genomes that are "sloppy" or error prone. This is sometimes called antigenic drift (influenza does this as well). Both of these mechanisms make it likely that, over time, the difference between the vaccine and the virus is such that your body will no longer recognize one as the other. In contrast to RNA viruses like HIV and influenza, viruses that have their genomes stored as double stranded DNA, like smallpox, have  , which means antigenic drift is less of a problem, and it's not prone to antigenic shift. This means that a vaccine developed against it wasn't made ineffective by the virus evolving such that it didn't provoke an immune response (known as antigenic escape). This stability made smallpox an excellent target for a vaccine, and the lack of stability is why developing a long-lasting vaccine against influenza and HIV is so difficult.	2015-07-11 00:36:56Z	Fomite	13

Myalgias and arthralgias (muscle and joint aches) are also reported but are typically more mild than with flu). The common cold is invariably caused by viruses and more than one family of viruses is capable of producing this syndrome with varying degrees of severity and duration depending on the virus.  The best known virus family is the  . Rhinovirus has at least 99 serotypes.  This presents a challenge to the body's immune system as an immune response to one serotype may not provide any protection against other serotypes.  It is possible for a person to be consecutively infected with rhinoviridae of different serotypes.  The durability of immunity to a rhinovirus strain, once established, is not known.  It remains possible that over time, a person can become susceptible to reinfection. Because human adaptive immunity requires antigen exposure, there is little that someone can do on their own to "boost" their specific immunity against cold viruses.  There is no vaccine (so many viruses and serotypes to consider). Boosting non-specific immunity (the acute inflammatory mechanisms) is a strategy that has not been well explored, but this approach is hard to recommend.  Non-specific immunity is a two-edged sword with the potential to damage the host's own body in addition to its role as the "first responders" to a pathogen.  Over the counter products that purport to "boost immunity to colds" are largely clinically untested.  Vitamin C has been examined.  In a July 2007 study, researchers wanted to discover whether taking 200 milligrams or more of vitamin C daily could reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of a cold. After reviewing 60 years of clinical research, they found that when taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken daily, vitamin C very slightly shorted cold duration. Most over the counter immune boosters for colds are vitamin B and C based, which makes them safe and reasonably non-toxic so their use can't be discouraged.  Therapeutic doses of water-soluble vitamins usually result in very expensive urine.  Recently an analysis of several studies showed that zinc lozenges or syrup reduced the length of a cold by one day, especially when taken within 24 hours of the first signs and symptoms of a cold.  Studies also showed that taking zinc regularly might reduce the number of colds each year, the number of missed school days, and the amount of antibiotics required in otherwise healthy children.  Zinc can potentially have some side-effects, so you should talk to your doctor before beginning zinc supplementation.  Rhinoviridae is very infectious, lives outside the body for hours to days, and is readily transmitted by auto-inoculation from encounters with contaminated surfaces.  The best "immune booster" for colds really, truly is frequent hand-washing.	2015-07-09 22:53:23Z	scottb	6
1488	4910	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4910	, exercise is theorized to have a positive effect on the immune system via a few different mechanisms, although the rigorous proof that it does anything at all is still lacking (that's most likely a result of a lack of research in this area). As this source says, you should not overdo it, but then the amount of exercise that will be too much for you depends on your fitness level to begin with. So, the fitter you are the harder you can actually exercise before you pass the break even point where the negative effects start to grow larger than the positive effects. 	2016-02-22 00:53:04Z	Count Iblis	0

A meal will create a rise in glucose, but this will only last about 2 hours, so that you will have raised glucose only 6 hours out of 24. So this is one reason why the fasting glucose is the glucose to which your body is exposed most of the time.  But more important, the doctors don't care for your peak glucose levels, they care for the equilibrium level of your glucose homeostasis, and that's 5 mmol or somewhere very close to it. If it is not there, then the mechanism for achieving it is broken, no matter what your postprandial glucose levels are. So both of your assumptions are incorrect.  And if you are on a diet which has your blood glucose levels constantly elevated, that's a very calorie dense diet and you are probably indeed in trouble. But even then, measuring your fasting glucose is important, because the doctor cannot make any conclusions from the raised levels.  By the way, there is also another test for blood sugar which gives you an estimation of not the current blood sugar, but of the average blood sugar over the last few weeks. Both an elevated fasting glucose and an elevated hgb 1ac levels are diagnostic criteria for diabetes, so if you somehow managed to keep your fasting glucose low but your average glucose unreasonably high, this could be discovered and you will be diagnosed with diabetes or warned that you are in a prediabetic condition, depending on the current diagnose guidelines used in your country. But if you suspect this, you should probably inform your physician, as I don't think hgb a1c is measured in routine blood tests.  Source: a Coursera course on diabetes I can't link because it's no longer open, sorry. Maybe somebody else has a linkable source and can edit it in. 	2015-07-08 16:51:24Z	rumtscho	4

These changes are also meal dependent (I work in a lab and we recently found a way to estimate a person's citrus fruit consumption fairly reliably based on changes in urine).  By instructing you to fast, healthcare providers are attempting to check you when your wildly fluctuating lab results are as stable as possible by minimizing factors like the timing and composition of your meal. That way any results they draw are more likely to reflect something actually wrong with your heath rather than what you last ate.	2015-07-10 02:42:10Z	Eli Riekeberg	0
1484	1494	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1494	Good question! The missing bit of information here is that topical steroids are usually not absorbed systemically at high enough levels to cause adrenal suppression. However, they sometimes are. I shall explain. First of all, regarding the relationship between   corticosteroid administration and adrenal insufficiency, please see  . The basic idea (which I think you understand) is that exogenous administration of medications that mimic cortisol (a hormone produced in the adrenal gland) suppress the body’s processes for stimulating the hormone naturally. The adrenal gland atrophies due to the lack of natural stimulation. This causes a problem if the medication is suddenly withdrawn, because the body can’t quickly recover the ability to produce cortisol itself. This is called   or  .   Now to your question: The answer is that   topical steroids are absorbed into the bloodstream at high enough levels for a long enough time to suppress the HPA axis, they will cause adrenal insufficiency. Usually this degree of absorption occurs only with the use of “Group I” topical steroids, the strongest ones.   shows the different categories of topical steroids by potency. The “super-potent” Group I includes:   The most important factors that determine whether or not HPA suppression will occur are the potency of the drug, the dose, and the duration of use. The Group I agents can cause significant HPA suppression if used for two or more weeks at a dose of ~2g/day. Other factors that predispose to HPA suppression include: The first list in your question appears to mostly outline   effects of withdrawing topical steroids. These are possible with less potent steroids and do not require systemic absorption. The second list, on the other hand, describes a syndrome of adrenal insufficiency. These are likely only the circumstances described above.      Tadicherla S, Ross K, Shenefelt PD, Fenske NA.  . J Drugs Dermatol. 2009;8(12):1093. Walsh P, Aeling JL, Huff L, Weston WL.

1481	1518	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1518	The only difference it makes to the liver how alcohol is consumed is how high the blood alcohol content becomes and for how long - the other particulars of the beverage will be filtered out by the digestion process. Beverages containing a higher alcohol content will tend to cause a higher peak blood alcohol content because they can be consumed more quickly than the same amount of alcohol in a larger volume, and the more concentrated alcohol will be absorbed from the stomach more quickly. The liver is limited in its capacity to process alcohol. Low blood concentrations of alcohol are efficiently converted into acetate and metabolized, but at high concentrations some of the alcohol is converted into toxic acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is thought to cause hangover symptoms and also contribute to liver cell death through oxidative stress (Min, JA; Lee, K; Ki, D. June 2010.    , 3(2): 110-115). Replacement of these cells leads over time to enlargement of the liver, accumulation of scar tissue (cirrhosis) and cancer. So avoiding hangover by consuming alcohol in moderation may help avoid liver damage if alcohol is consumed. It is also very important to avoid consumption of acetaminophen with alcohol because processing the alcohol prevents the liver from properly eliminating the acetaminophen, which can cause severe liver damage. Like the liver, the brain is also only concerned with the concentration of alcohol in the blood and how long it has been that way, in terms of how intoxication is experienced. It will take more alcohol as beer to produce the same level of intoxication as vodka because more of it will have had time to metabolize before the peak blood concentration is reached. The brain also becomes more tolerant to the effects of alcohol as time passes, so that the blood concentration has to be increased over time to maintain the same level of intoxication. So having more drinks to maintain the same experience will be harder on the liver than the initial drinks.	2015-07-10 19:05:04Z	Chris Jenks	7
1480	12954	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12954	As has been pointed out in the comments, a common cold is already a (viral) infection. By far the largest part of upper airway infections are viral and the body is very capable of clearing them up. It is a common misconception that that the colour of the mucus gives information about whether it is viral or bacterial.   shows that the sensitivity of yellowish or greenish sputum used as a test for a bacterial infection was 0.79 (95% CI 0.63–0.94); the specificity was 0.46  (95% CI 0.038–0.53), which is very low. A visit to your doctor for a cold is almost never necessary. Even in the case that there is a bacterial infection, your body can almost always get rid of it itself.   concludes that in acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis (which is, essentially, what we call "a cold") there is no place for antibiotics. It may cause the cold to be over faster than it would be without antibiotics, but without the antibiotics there is a very very low rate of complications. Antibiotics cause adverse events and resistance of bacteria, so they should not be used without reason.  
As there is no reason for antibiotics, a visit to your doctor will also not be useful. A subsequent upper airway infection with coughing is often caused by something called post-nasal drip (essentially mucus from the nose dripping into the throat), which sucks but doesn't warrent a visit to the doctor. Signs of a possible pneumonia are: fever for >3 days or recurrent fever after a few fever-free days, dyspnea or wheezing (this is based on the   so I don't have an English source for this). In this case, I would definitely recommend going to your doctor. There is still a realistic chance that you're not going to need antibiotics, but that is a decision the doctor needs to make based on the specific circumstances and this cannot be assessed over the internet.	2017-07-14 12:35:12Z	Tami	3

1474	1545	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1545	I've suffered from depression quite a few years in my life. One basic long-term cause I have found is my basic worldview - whether I see reality as fundamentally "good" or "bad". This takes a long time to improve. But in the short term, I find my feelings strongly influenced by my ability to effectively respond to what life has brought along. If I set twenty goals and fail at all in a row, I tend to feel pretty low, whereas if I succeed then I tend to feel alright. When I advise students beginning research in chemistry, for example, I suggest that if they start to get frustrated to go "wash the dishes". This is helpful because washing the glassware is an activity where success is very likely, whereas chemical research can be fraught with disappointments easily beyond the ability of a novice (or even expert) chemistry student to predict. What we are seeing here is a phenomenon called  . Since it affects rodents it should come as no surprise that it affects us too. All it amounts to is a basic learning process that generalizes recent failure at a particular task to be a reduced ability to accomplish all tasks. Unlike rodents, though, we have the advantage of seeing through reason that the depressed feelings are unjustified, and acting out of reason in spite of how we feel. Students with difficult or impossible chemistry research assignments can still know themselves as competent chemists and worthwhile people. It could also be burn out. How long have you been at the same computer-related occupation? I've been an application developer for the last ten years myself, but my life is full of other activities outside of work.

1471	1779	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1779	We are looking at   here.  The human heart has a left and a right side. On both sides there are a ventricle and an atrium    . Basically the heart is just a bulk of muscle tissue responsible for circulation and blood flow. As with any muscle contraction when there is a resistance against the working muscle this leads to muscle growth or hypertrophy. A bad example of such resistance is  . Due to the elevated blood pressure, the heart must pump and contract against a continuously present counter force and this leads to a heart muscle hypertrophy, or ventricular hypertrophy  . When hypertrophy is due to, say, high blood pressure this hypertrophy or growth is pathological and  . In your case, there is probably also some heart muscle hypertrophy but it is non-pathologic and it can be considered as a healthy "heart condition". The principle is the same. When you workout your heart must work more efficiently compared to its resting state and pump more blood to the skeletal muscles due to increased demand for oxygen.  .  Whether the heart muscle growth is pathologic or non-pathologic depends on the concept of afterload  . In a healthy heart the afterload is minimal indicating that the heart "can rest" shortly after ejection or ventricular contraction. This results to beneficial hypertrophy. However, if a substantial   is present, which is the case in elevated blood pressure, the heart "can't rest" after contraction but instead is must maintain some level of muscle contraction which results in adverse muscle hypertrophy. However, in extreme cases the workout can result in some health issues, called an athletic heart syndrome  .  This is still far less adverse than heart failure.	2015-08-04 07:06:07Z	YviDe	2
1469	1472	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1472	Junk food is a somewhat generic term that basically includes calories from food that has no real nutritional value, or is so loaded with artificial flavors, added sugars/fats that it overwhelms the nutritional value that was there. Many of the items on your list   be considered junk food, depending on how they are eaten, how much and how often. For example, a Domino's thick crust pizza with pepperoni, sausage, extra cheese is loaded with saturated fats, lots of calories for not a lot of substance. However, you could get a thin crust pizza with a light amount of cheese, green peppers, mushrooms and black olives, and while still not the best of foods would be a much better option. Same for fruit juice - If you get a pure juice such as a squeezed orange juice with no additives, it will be much better than a cranberry juice from extract with added sugar. Also, as noted in this  , these foods tend to be less satiating, that is they satisfy hunger much less than "real" foods, so that you typically end up eating more of them to satisfy hunger, which in turn leads to higher caloric intake. Other items, such as the chocolate, spring roll may not be the best (Depending on what is in the spring roll), but in little bits are ok. It's very hard to eat a clean diet, especially if you are busy, but with some planning and cooking ahead, you can make a diet very healthy, and still leave room for some items like chocolates, candies.  As long as the junk food is limited in intake, and doesn't make up the majority of the diet (As a personal rule, I try to limit "junk" calories to no more than 10% of my weekly intake), a little bit should be fine. However, in light of this being a doctor's recommendation, and given the lab values in your other question, it might be a good idea to have a consultation with a dietitian/nutritionist to help create an achievable, healthy eating plan.	2015-07-06 22:09:30Z	JohnP	9

1456	288	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/288	You're going to want to read the label from top to bottom. The first thing you will see at the top tells you the serving size and the amount of calories. It will say "Serving Size {x} " where x is the amount of whatever measurement is used. It may also give the amount of another measurement (usually grams) and sometimes even amount of how many of the product is one serving size (chip bags usually do this). Using the amount of servings that you eat, you can use simple math to determine how much of each nutrient/vitamin you have, this also includes the daily value percentage.  Under the serving size, there will be the amount of calories and the amount of calories from fat. The calories shown are the calories per serving, so if you eat two servings, then you can double the amount of calories. You can compare the calories that you eat to the daily amount you are supposed to have.  General rules for calories (based on a 2000 calorie diet) Calories from fat are just the amount of calories that come from fat in the product. Calories are important because eating too many calories is linked to obesity. The next section (under calories) on the food label is about the nutrients in the food. There are two subsections in this section, nutrients to limit and nutrients to get enough of. These nutrients have been shown to increased risks some cancers, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Getting more of these has been shown to reduce the risk of many of the diseases and problems mentioned, but you shouldn't have too many of these. These foods are neutral-ish, but there are some risks in having too much (over the limit) of these. In fact, too much sugar has been shown to increase the risk of diabetes. The nutrients to limit usually have both an actual amount and a daily value percentage (%DV) based on a 2000 calories diet. The nutrient to get enough of usually don't. Guide to %DV If you have something that has 20%DV of vitamin A, then there will 80%DV of vitamin A left. You could eat 4 more products with 20%DV of vitamin A or some other combination that equals 80%DV. There will three columns, one with the daily recommended amount for a 2000 calories diet and one for a 2500 calorie diet. All of the %DV are based on the 2000 calorie diet, but you can easily convert the percentages to the 2500 calorie diet if you have a calculator (or you can do them by hand). The one column I didn't mention is the calories column. If it says "Less than" then you should have less than the amount said in the column of the diet you are on. Usually "Total Fat", "Sat Fat", "Cholesterol", and "Sodium" will have a "Less than" next to them, so you should have less of these than the amount to the right says. "Total Carbohydrates" and under it "Dietary Fiber" will usually have nothing next to them, so you should get the recommended value to the right. This is a bit trickier than reading the actual label, but the ingredients should be put in order of quantity. There isn't any definite way to see the exact amount of each ingredient in the product, though. It is better to rely on the amount of each nutrient instead of trying to guess how much of each ingredient there is. If you just want to know what you are eating, then there are some good tricks.	2015-04-03 17:13:39Z	Community	12

I wouldn't call it a closed case by any standard, although many sites hawk caffeine as a great improver of memory, especially long-term memory. I haven't shown the same amount of studies in all three categories - neutral, positive, and negative - and that's by design. There is a substantial amount of studies that found no significant effects, and that much more research would be needed to give strong evidence for long-term benefits. There is a decent amount of studies showing some positive long-term benefits, and almost none showing negative long-term benefits. Therefore, I don't think it's safe to go in any of the three directions. However, it does seem like the effects of long-term caffeine use may be negligible. Also, be careful to differentiate between long-term effects of caffeine on memory and the effects of caffeine on long-term memory! Studies often cover both, because studying subjects over only a few days won't tell you much about long-term memory (certainly not about acquisition, at least). However, they aren't the same thing.	2015-11-30 22:46:06Z	HDE 226868	6
1442	1446	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1446	The general consensus on the internet and among various physical trainers is that static stretching in 20-30 second segments is sufficient to increase range of motion (ROM) in a muscle. This is corroborated by two studies (Very similar in nature, conducted by the same people), where   showed that there was no difference when time was increased from 30 to 60 seconds and performed multiple times per day, and   no gains when solely increasing from 30-60 seconds per stretch. However, if your goal is to increase flexibility, then you may want to also look at adding proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) type stretching once or twice a week. The most basic form of this is to get into a stretch, and then isometrically contract (joint/muscle stay static, rather than moving) against the stretch. This is, however, an advanced stretching technique and should only be done after proper instruction.   showed that PNF stretching also was the only one that produced performance enhancement. Ballistic stretching (lean and bounce) type stretching has been much maligned, and is still contraindicated because of the tendency towards producing injury. (It tends to activate the   in muscles and produce tears/strains). However,   that it may aid in jumping type performances. TL;DR Dynamic stretching before workouts (active movement that mimics the motions of the sport), and static stretching after (30 seconds, and I personally do a stretch and hold, relax, repeat even deeper type of cycle for each muscle) produce some of your best gains for the typical everyday person. PNF can get even greater gains if needed. However, it has not been proven yet (Despite claims) that any type of stretching produces better injury prevention or reduces muscle soreness after workouts. Also, static stretching before performance has been shown to negatively impact performance.	2015-07-02 20:54:17Z	JohnP	6
1440	1588	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1588	There are several reasons why we can't specify the range here on Health SE, especially for anti-TPO Ab. Antibodies are proteins, produced by our immune system. Determining the concentration of a specific protein is somewhat more difficult than determining the concentration of a smaller molecule. Still, there are various methods for this - for antibodies those are mostly immunological assays. If you test the same sample with various methods, you could get different results. From  : How can you trust these tests if they give different results? Each test method has to be   and standardised. This means that various parameters (that have been determined as important) are checked for each method against a standard or a referent method. The important thing is that one interprets the value obtained by testing a certain sample by a certain method by comparing it to the  . From the same source:  This is pretty straight forward. E.g. if there are variations between sexes, the lab report should come with two referent ranges (one for each sex), and specify which is which. Sample population is also important, and some referent ranges are defined for the majority population living in a certain area. If somebody told me that their body temperature is 97 degrees, I'd say that's impossible. This is because I'm used to Celsius scale, where water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. In fact,   shows that 97.16 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to 36.2 degrees Celsius, which is within normal body temperature range. Same goes for determining concentration - there are many "types" of concentrations (molar, mass, etc.) and each of these can be expressed in various units. Furthermore, the amount/level of the tested parameter doesn't have to be a concentration at all.  : If you have your test results, they should have come with units and reference ranges (usually written in a column at the right of the report). If you don't have these, it might be a good idea to contact the test lab if possible and inquire for details. If the results are not within the reference range, this can mean a number of things. It might imply that there is an underlying condition causing this. For thyroid, the values of TSH and anti-TPO Ab can point to several, very different conditions. You shouldn't try to discern these on your own - even if you have referent ranges. This is what doctors are for. You should not expect a physician to interpret these results via phone or e-mail, because   Other parts include: anamnesis, family anamnesis (medical history of your relatives), physical examination and possibly (but not necessarily) imaging methods, such as ultrasound.  What's more, even within a certain referent range, for some hormones it depends very much on your age e.g. in which part of the interval are the "ideal", i.e. optimal values. : Leave the interpretation and the diagnosis to your doctor.  Suggested reading:  An aside: determining TSH values is more straightforward, but still various sources give different referent ranges:  :  0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L and  : 0.5-6 uU/ml.	2015-07-16 23:22:05Z	Lucky	5

Several different different types of benign growths can cause loss of hearing because they may block the ear canal. One of these types of growths are   (aka Surfer's ear). Surfer's ear is caused by exposure to cold air or cold water. Odds are that frequent cold showers won't cause Surfer's ear, because usually the growth is caused by both cold air   cold water (doesn't always have to be cold, but it is much more likely for cold air and water to cause it than warm air and water). Extoses be treated through surgery to remove the growth (obviously this wasn't possible in the 18th and 19th century). It is also possible that loss of hearing can be be caused by a condition known as   which is the result of prolonged exposure of the ear to moisture and water. Things like swimming (hence the name) or routine showering can cause this, which means it may be possible for you to experience a sudden loss of hearing. This water doesn't have to be cold though. Swimmer's ear doesn't always cause loss of hearing and when it does, it is only temporary and can be treated with some medications and eardrops.	2015-07-02 20:21:23Z	michaelpri	3

Given the high levels of anxiety and stress commonly seen in patients with  , evidence suggests that the syndrome may be linked to a disruption of the stress system. The stress response in the body involves the sympathetic nervous system which has been shown to operate abnormally in IBS patients. In an article by  , scientists are inferring that ‘ ’, or enteric nervous system (ENS) is the link between what's going on in the gut and it's effect on the brain, or the relationship between digestion and mood. Jay Pastricha, MD, Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Neurogastroenterology states that the main role of the ENS is: As described in  , when your sympathetic nervous system is activated by a stressful event, for example, it initiates a “fight or flight” response -- a mechanism that primes the body for action, particularly in situations that threaten survival. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels, including those in the digestive tract. Because the blood vessels in the gastrointestinal organs constrict, the digestive tract will inhibit peristalsis (digestion) and result in a variety of GI symptoms. The GI tract is generally sensitive to emotion in most people (even those who do not have IBS) as anger, anxiety, sadness, and elation (among others) can all trigger symptoms in the gut. For example, you've likely heard or even spoken the words "going with your gut" when making a decision or feeling like you have "butterflies in your stomach" when feeling nervous. In people who suffer from IBS however, the ENS may trigger big emotional shifts which can lead to functional bowel problems such as  ,  , bloating, pain, and stomach upset.  People with IBS can experience either constipation, diarrhea, or both depending on the individual and how their emotionally triggered symptoms present. According to  :  Research also suggests that digestive system activity may affect cognition (thinking skills and memory). As explained by a   article: In an effort to provide further evidence in response to "How does your mental state actually affect the functioning of the bowel?": Psychological factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as presenting symptoms. As it relates to IBS, stress can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract or can increase inflammation. Additionally, people with IBS may perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains do not properly regulate pain signals from the GI tract. When faced with a stress-causing event, the existing pain can feel worse. As stated in the article,  : 	2017-10-19 18:32:14Z	Taylor	5

For someone who follows a regular food habit and is generally healthy there won't be any reason to take anything else to increase bowel movements.

If you are acutely constipated for some reason, and is making you miserable, and do not have any other symptoms(such as vomiting, abdominal pain, blood in stool, etc) then you can take an over the counter laxative for one day and see if it resolves the issue. That can be simple mineral oil, castor oil, Isapghula, etc. If a single dose of any of those does not improve your costipation, then you should consult a doctor. The doctor can look at the cause of constipation and prescribe a medicine for you appropriately for a short duration of time. Some people who take certain pills ( ) are likely to be chronically constipated. In that case one may have to use laxatives for a long duration of time, but that decision is taken by a doctor.

Explanation: Close bodily contact of any kind can transmit herpes.  That is, the virus jumps from an infected person to another person by close bodily contact (i.e. rubbing of some type).   If someone was engaged in a sexual act with you and rubbed an infected part of their skin on your thigh, then, yes, your infection would be considered a sexually transmitted infection.   If your lesion is reasonably far from the genital area, however, it's more likely to be an instance of herpes gladiotorum, which is a sports disease, not a sexual disease.  Wrestlers, rugby players (in a scrum), and so on, engage in very close physical contact, and this can lead to spread of herpes from one person to another through a non-sexual route. As a child, you may not have been playing rugby, but you might have been wrestling with an infected friend, or the friend may have bit you on the thigh, or who knows what.  Where your friend got infected, or how, is of lesser importance. If it has not come back since the original appearance, I would not worry about it.

Try avoiding it if possible as research has been conducted which suggests that there is a linkage between irregular sleep and hormone production. Evidence also suggests that lack of sleep won't do you as much damage as irregular or day sleep. I suggest try changing your profession. If that isn't possible due to personal or social reasons then I'd say try adjusting your shift so you can sleep at night. Erratic sleep is bad no matter what. While you might be able to reduce the effects bit napping at night, it won't make much difference.

It's entirely possible that these are out of range and not indicative of a problem. Assuming that you are healthy aside from the Vit-D, we will only consider sleep. There is quite a bit of evidence for shift workers having increased rates of certain illnesses. Unfortunately, it is hard to say whether this is because of the actual timing of the work or because of the interruptions in sleep that tend to be more prevalent among people who sleep in this way.

1393	1430	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1430	Provided that you are healthy, not suffering from a cold, disease state or other suppression of the immune system, moderate exercise during fasting periods should not impact your health. For submaximal efforts, you may notice earlier fatigue, and there will be definite performance impacts the closer you get to maximal efforts. Caveat: You are still introducing an artificial state (fasted), which may have health complications. I would schedule a consult with a physician and explain your plans, and have them give you a checkup with that in mind before starting this. However, there will be some impact on the effective level of the exercise, and how well you are able to perform the exercise during the later parts of the fasting period. These changes include depression in max VO2 (Although this value is more of a performance predictor, not really a measurement metric), higher levels of free fatty acids (FFA's) in the blood, as well as a somewhat suppressed gluconeogenesis as well as a concurrent rise in fat based oxidation for energy. What this means, is that your body will (mostly) use up all muscle and hepatic (liver) glycogen storage, and will turn to fax oxidation (ketone bodies) for fuel. There is not that much difference in the lactate/pyruvate levels during this time, suggesting that the switch is adequate to fuel performing muscles. There are other short term changes in several hormone and substrate (glycogen, pyruvate, lactate, etc) levels, but these are returned to normal after resuming normal dietary intake. While not an ideal state to pursue, intermittent periods of short fasting ( < 12 hours) or even up to a few days shouldn't have any health impacts, although you may notice some performance impairment.  I was able to obtain, only the first page is freely available. This took 5 obese subjects, and in a clinical setting (hospital), underwent a 3-5 week fast, with only water and vitamin supplements for health. They showed the changes described above in hormone and substrates, with a drop in VO2 max levels at the 2 and 4 week exercise marks. There was also substantial weight loss, but that is to be expected. They showed no other adverse health effects during the prolonged fast, but to emphasize, they had adequate water intake and daily vitamin and potassium supplementation. Another paper   looked at 12 hour fasting for Ramadan and the effect on athletic performance, and found that even in the limited fasting state, there is some performance impact. One passage stands out in the paper: That is corroborated by other sections in the paper, one detailing performance impacts on cycling at 100% VO2 max level after 24 hours fast, and impacts on high intensity events such as the 100m and 800m runs. Interestingly, one section shows no difference in muscle glycogen stores in the absence of exercise during fasting. They do postulate that because of the metabolic acidosis that starts rising with prolonged fast is part of the reason for early fatigue in exercise, which is interesting. The second paper also has 57 cited studies relating to exercise in a fasted state.	2015-06-30 16:37:36Z	JohnP	6

From my experience I can say that #2 is very true, as dim and warm light in the workplace made me sleepy and inefficient. Changing light sources to bright and cool fluorescent lights helped a lot. Also I've installed RGB led lighting in my living room and discovered that using only red light at the end of the day makes falling asleep easier. Just looking at BenQ's idea it certainly appeals to me. However, the purpose of a monitor is to reproduce colors accurately. The question remains if the amount of blue can be reduced without affecting either color balance or just lowering brightness altogether. Modern "white" LEDs commonly used as source of light in LCD monitors are primarily blue light sources with some yellow phosphorus thrown in to balance out main emission. If BenQ used different kind of LEDs of CCFLs (less bluish) then this technology could not be turned on and off, much less adjusted. To truly limit the amount of certain component on the fly, RGB-LEDs would have to be used as backlight (they are not used here, and I'm not aware of any affordable monitor with RGB LEDs). What is presented on the video seems like simply changing color temperature to a warmer one - which is available in almost every color monitor. Even if it's not plain old color temperature, but something more sophisticated, e.g. clamp on blue channel in gamma ramp then same effect can still be achieved in software, in graphic card's gamma settings. I disagree much with the video on the site you've linked. Even layman like me can easily point out errors: Bottom line:   in the best case. If you really want to considerably reduce amount of blue light coming from your monitor, I recommend changing white backgrounds to yellow ones (if you work with lots of white backgrounds). This will drastically cut blue light reaching your eyes in a way not possible when still retaining impression of whiteness. Of course, eliminating large, bright areas by using dark themes (white-on-black text) will greatly cut ALL light. If you seek to reduce strain on your eyes from monitor then I agree with statement that the biggest issue is not just the amount of light coming from the monitor. The biggest factor IMHO is the   between monitor and it's background, that is the rest of the room. Therefore never use a computer/phone/tablet in total darkness - leave some nightlight + lower brightness to match. Also don't be afraid to crank up monitor up to 11 in a sunny day. Most monitors are set up to allow easy access to brightness and contrast adjustment - exactly for this very reason. They are meant to be used every time light in the room changes.	2015-06-30 16:46:25Z	InterLinked	11

So brushing immediately after eating is a bad idea, no matter what you've eaten, because the acidity will temporarily weaken the enamel.  I believe you can brush too hard, and I've heard that brushing should be more like a gentle tickle, without forcing the brush against your teeth, but I think this is hard to get across, as it is rather subjective. The very term 'brushing' also refers to activities that require physical effort and involve forcing things to move, eg brushing the floor or brushing your hair straight, so I'm not surprised if people over do it. Television has also been flooded with toothbrush adverts over the years, which normally contain an animation illustrating particles being 'brushed off' the tooth, and this gives the impression that some force is required.
Also, use a toothbrush with soft bristles.  If you rinse your mouth immediately after brushing, most of the residual toothpaste will be washed out completely, but if you don't rinse then the active ingredients are given a bit longer to help clean your teeth.    If you use a small circular action when you brush, then you'll increase the contact of the bristles with the gaps between your teeth, and the circular motion can help to ease out little bits. If you simply move the toothbrush over and along the teeth, there will be less contact with the gaps.   	2015-06-26 15:15:45Z	enap_mwf	3

For example, you might say (in Japanese), "Doctor, I can't hear as well as I used to and I think it may be due to an injury to my ear canal some time ago. Can you please have a look?" I would expect the doctor to examine both ear canals. If your theory is correct, the doctor won't need further explanation. She will see it with her own eyes and know what to do about it. She will probably also want to test your hearing in both ears. I would not be terribly surprised to find that the cause is something other than what you suspect.  Assuming that you don't speak fluent Japanese and he/she doesn't speak fluent English, you might consider bringing a translator along with you since the doctor will no doubt have questions and perhaps need to explain things to you. It's the sort of situation where language barriers can be troublesome and you don't want to risk misunderstandings.	2015-06-22 20:15:59Z	Carey Gregory	11

It appears the dysfunction of the LES/LOS is considered to be a cause of heartburn, specifically causing GORD, which then leads to heartburn. I'd like to emphasize that heartburn generally isn't a standalone illness, but a symptom of something else, just like a sore throat may be a symptom of, say, strep throat.

Guesses are good in game shows; in medicine, it helps to have more to base a diagnosis on. You are correct that acute iron toxicity (for example, from children eating iron-containing vitamins because they are candy-like) can result in coma. But to my knowledge (and I have seen and treated many metallic foreign bodies), iron toxicity from such an exposure would be unlikely. Aside from ingestion, the two most common reasons for iron overload are  1) repeated transfusions required for various anemias (where red blood cells are destroyed by the body and need to be replaced), or when bone marrow has stopped functioning properly and RBC's must be supplied; this is called  , 2) iron-overload disorders owing to genetic misregulation of iron absorption, referred to as hereditary hemochromatosis (or  ).  Primary hemochromatosis can be treated by removing blood periodically, forcing the body to use up the excess iron, or by chelation therapy. So, untreated, yes, iron overload from this source is permanent. Acute iron toxicity can be treated with chelating agents is severe enough. While hemochromatosis is not rare, fainting is   (so common it is difficult to estimate it's occurrence due to underreporting); rough estimates are that   35% of the population will have at least one episode in their lifetime. There is a bimodal distribution, with the first peak around the late teens (one-third of medical students report at least one syncopal episode) and the second starting around the seventies. Again, numbers are hard to obtain for fainting (syncope), but the most common cause is vasovagal (fear, pain, prolonged standing, etc.), followed by cardiac causes. Although fainting is common, the only real way to determine its probable cause is to see a medical professional, who can gather the information necessary to make a diagnosis.

I'm not familiar with the Dr. Coca pulse test, but the paper you link to mentions pulse rates that differ by only 10 BPM.   I suspect the accuracy also depends on your physiology. I would recommend trying a wrist monitor such as the Fitbit HR, a chest strap monitor, and taking your pulse manually. Do this while you're inactive and compare the results. If the Fitbit HR is off from your manual measurement by 25 BPM, it sounds like it won't be useful for the Dr. Coca pulse test.

The muscles of the tongue and pharynx can propel these kinds of objects (including liquid) into the esophagus with ease, unless there is some specific pathology at work.  Chewing also tends to naturally push food toward the swallowing position. The tablets and capsules you asked about, on the other hand, tend to be dry and hard and are not chewed.  There is little for the tongue and throat muscles to 'grab' as they try to push the object back to where it can actually enter the esophagus.  They also tend to get stuck because of their dryness. Once you have actually swallowed a pill without water or food to help it along, the difficulty for the ingestion process does not end.  The esophagus also has difficulty pushing them down to the stomach, though gravity helps.  Sometimes they do end up lodged in the esophagus where they ultimately dissolve and pass on down, but not before they may have caused damage to the lining of the esophagus from their caustic properties or just from the pressure of it's presence.

The reason for this is that the alkyl groups on toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene can all be metabolized to carboxylic acids by the liver rather than oxidizing the ring directly, which creates a phenol. Metabolism of benzene to phenol increases its toxicity (to the liver). Of the cases listed I would expect cooking with the water to cause the least exposure to the dissolved hydrocarbons. The reason for this is that they are volatile with steam, so that boiling the water would cause the listed hydrocarbons to be quickly removed in the steam. By the same token, bathing with the water may cause significant exposure to the hydrocarbon as it evaporates into the air in the shower.	2015-07-13 23:49:29Z	Chris Jenks	3

This is a process that happens naturally in the gut even if you don't drink alcohol. The digestive system has evolved to not waste such a valuable source of energy many millions of years ago. There is a complete enzyme chain in place to break down and use alcohol as a source of energy. 
Please note that naturally occurring fermentation yields only small amounts of alcohol and that our digestive system is not geared to deal long term with the large amounts of alcohol that some people ingest. Liver damage occurs when the enzymes available to break down alcohol safely get overwhelmed and leave toxic metabolites behind which then in turn damage liver cells.

This can result in a life-threatening increased effect of coumadin. Note also that not all drug checkers are alike in their ability to calculate risks/side effects.  For example, at Web.MD, the combination of ketoconazole oral + warfarin oral will give you a "serious" risk: But   gives only a "moderate" risk, with the "professional" option going into more detail: And gives you references!

1302	1332	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1332	You are right that there are conflicting viewpoints about whether or not Vaseline and other types of petroleum jelly, also known as petrolatum, are comedogenic (can cause or worsen acne). There are medical professionals who will say that petroleum jelly will cause acne, while others might argue the opposite. The same also goes for research, though most research points to petroleum jelly being non-comedogenic.  Why might petroleum jelly be comedogenic? Petroleum jelly is very greasy. This greasiness could cause petroleum jelly to be comedogenic. Research has also shown this may be the case, but there is also some more reliable research that suggests that this is false. Because people have wondered if petroleum jelly is comedogenic for a long time, most studies on this topic are a little bit older (pre-2000). Also, most studies that suggest the petroleum jelly might cause acne were done on rabbits, who are much more sensitive to cosmetics than humans are.  A 1972 article that introduced acne cosmetica,  acne caused by cosmetic products, tested many different cosmetic creams on rabbit ear canals, and found that many of them, including petroleum jelly, were mildly comedogenic. The research also found that using petroleum jelly or other cosmetic substances can cause mild acne breakouts in some woman. This research wasn't extremely convincing that petroleum jelly is comedogenic as rabbits aren't the perfect model for seeing what the effect would be on human skin. Also, the research done on petroleum jelly's effect on actual human skin showed that it caused comedonal reactions, but only in some women. The most reliable study testing if petroleum jelly is comedogenic is probably a 1996 study by the same man who did the previous study I mentioned.  The results, after testing different products that use petroleum jelly on different groups of patients, were that there wasn't any comedogenic potential in petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly also didn't worsen acne at all. It is most likely that petroleum jelly is not comedogenic. Some studies point to it being comedogenic as a possibility, but rabbit ears are much more sensitive than human skin, so it is impossible to get definitive information from those studies. If you are worried about getting acne from using a product like Vaseline, you should be fine. Odds are, the Vaseline would be helping you more than hurting.	2015-06-21 19:46:44Z	michaelpri	6

They based their conclusion on studies showing that fluoride exposure during pregnancy can damage the brain which was consistent with three other studies from China which found that the brain of the human fetus can be significantly damaged by the mother’s high fluoride intake (safe dose for preventing this effect is not yet known). Further more, the National Research Council (NRC) expressed concern about fluoride’s possible contribution to dementia and "it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain and the body by direct and indirect means" .

Short summary, the new 2015 US PHS standard (0.7 mg/L) or even the old one (0.7-1.2 mg/L) are below the doses at which negative effects were observed in China (2.5-4.1 mg/L), and the evidence from there is not of high quality, even though there's one meta-analysis of it. (As a cautionary tale on inferring from low quality evidence,  , latter ones which filtered out low-quality studies were more skeptical.)

1289	1329	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1329	I think your skepticism may come from not understanding the process behind the claim.   A single unit of blood is separated into 4 main "blood products": red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and white blood cells. Another product called cryoprecipitate can be produced from frozen then thawed plasma and is used in special circumstances.  Whole blood is rarely used for transfusions anymore because of problems with transfusion reactions and, quite frankly, except in the case of massive hemorrhage, a single person rarely needs all these components all at once (and even then they probably won't need white blood cells).  Red blood cells (or packed red blood cells) are what most people think of when they get a "blood transfusion."  Plasma is given to people who do not have enough clotting factors in their blood to stop bleeding that is currently occurring or if it should occur.  Platelets are given to people who are not producing enough platelets to keep them from bleeding to death.  White blood cells are rarely given anymore, but there may be occasion to use them in specific cases. Now did that one unit save up to 3 lives?  Well, to answer that the question of whether their lives were in danger to begin with has to be answered.  The answer is, "Yes!"  When will they die without the product?  For some it's in the next several minutes, for others it may be hours, days or weeks, but in every case these peoples lives are in danger without the products derived from human blood. But did that unit all by itself achieve this? No, but in concert with the donations of others it   to saving "up to 3 lives." Because doctors try avoid using precious blood products until it is absolutely necessary by treating patients with other methods if possible, so by the time a person definitely requires blood products, they will get more than one unit, but had they been given products earlier without giving the 'other methods' a chance to work they would have needed just as much, maybe more, over time. The American Cancer Society has an excellent  .  I don't think the claim is derived from any particular set of statistics or the hard and fast numbers that you are seeking, but from the process involved. The best collection of statistical information online may be   published by the National Institutes of Health and  , published by the US Department of Health and Human Services (and several other departments and agencies).

1289	3909	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3909	I'm answering my own question, yay! This is my attempt to answer my question despite my lack of familiarity with much of the medicine.  I therefore stress that I am not guaranteeing this answer, it's meant to be a very rough estimate and shouldn't be considered exact.  Perhaps others will comment on things I missed and allow me to make it better... First, Here is a quick link that discusses the concept:  So there are three types of products that can be produced from whole blood, and each is divided into a nice 'unit', a base number used to define how much of a product is ordered by a hospital.  However,  one whole blood donation does not make up a full unit in any of these three.  So what we get is: Thus for 10 donations of red blood cells you will have produced 2 unit if platelets and 5 units of RDC and Plasma.  If one unit was required to save a life then you will save 12 lives with those 10 donations, or 1.2 lives per donation. However, it looks like many units are required per operation/transfusion/emergency.   in 2010 on average  .  This is not anywhere near an accurate estimate of units needed per 'life saved', but I'm trying for a very very rough estimate.  So for now lets say that each transfusion saved a life, and thus it took roughly 5.25 whole blood donations per 'life saved' via RBC.  In actuality the odds are not every patient was in a life critical situation, so we should look at the number of units used per patient who was in a life critical situation, but I don't have that number.  Since it seems likely that those in non-life critical situations would likely require less RBC then those in a life critical situation I would assume the units used per life-critical operation are higher, meaning the overall lives saved per whole blood donation is lower, but I don't have statistics on this. I know it can take up to   for a single organ donation; but that's probably a high estimate, to stress the importance of donations. Bone marrrow transplants used  , where a PC is defined to be the amount of platelets from a single donation of whole blood, but was also defined as requiring 9-6 PC to make a full unit; so a slight discrepancy from other numbers.  I would put that at an average of 5 units per bone marrow transfer? The average   with a healthy platelet count being  .  One unit should raise platelet count by  .  If we assume they would transfere enough platelets to get someone up to close to the lower end of 'healthy', 150,000, then they would need another 3-4 units per transfusion.  This seems in keeping with other math I saw, with all surgeries looking to require 5+ units.  Going with a favorable comparison lets say an average of 3 units per life-saving transfusion.  I'm not at all confident with this number, but it's the best I've managed so far. With that number were looking at 15-18 whole blood donations per one life saved with platelets. I give up and throw up my hands here.  Plasma is broken down into many different products, and trying to get averages for all those products to expand on the average units used is just too much. for now, until I get around to doing better research, lets be extra generous and assume every unit saves one life.  I highly doubt this, I would say it's likely that it's at least a minimum of 2 units per life saved, but I'm trying to stay on the generous side; and lacking any statistics I can at least say that they define units as a minimal quantity likely suggests they don't expect adults to ever need less then 1 unit per transfer which implies at least one is needed per life saving intervention.   Giving that likely generous presumption were looking at 1 life saved per two whole blood donations via plasma. There are other products that can be made out of whole blood.  None of them are nearly as useful as the above, and rarely are collected, but at least some of them are utilized and would add to overall lives saved by a very small amount.  I don't feel like adding them up since it sounds like they are such a minimal affect, and won't.  That's because I think any lives preserved via these methods is counteracted by...  due to waste or being too old.  I figure this waste more then counteracts the above other products, so I'm going to ignore both and just pretend they two affects perfectly countered each other. This is all very   rough math by a layman, so I am not swearing to any of it.  I was trying to error on the side of presuming maximum number of lives saved per donation; though it's entirely possible I missed an important factor which caused me to underestimate these numbers; feedback is welcome. However, as the math works out we have: This works out to .757 lives saved per donation. so a little less then 1 life saved per donation at my most generous; though I fear my being lazy and not doing a plasma calculation likely raised that number higher then it really should be.  Assuming I haven't made some obvious miscalculation; which is quite possible! So every 2 whole blood donations you make will save a life!  I've been donating for about 10 years now at about 1 donation per 2 months, so that still means more then 30 lives saved.  Still not bad considering how little it really costs me. I welcome feedback from anyone who has more knowledge about this then...well a geek googling random statistics who may be able to point out factors I missed.  This is definitely not definitive; but it's nice to have at least a rough rule of thumb.	2015-12-01 19:12:49Z	dsollen	2

In the US, about 37% of people can donate blood, 10-5% do, so the number of people that donate annually in the US is about 5.8 million using the more conservative 5% estimate, and the average number of people saved per year is 4.5 million, so that means one donation saves about 1.1 lives.Using a more liberal estimate of around 10%, each donation saves around 2.7 lives. 	2017-04-09 05:08:58Z	user8850	0
1289	14997	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14997	"Lives saved" is a difficult thing to measure: if someone needs a transfusion every day, do we say their life was saved every day? What if they need their pacemaker eighty times a minute, is the pacemaker saving their life every time it makes their heart beat? Health professionals often speak in terms of disability-adjusted life years, or quality-adjusted life years. So if a treatment keeps someone alive for three years longer than they otherwise would have lived, but because they were wheelchair bound the quality of their life was down by 20% (I'm making these numbers up, if that's not clear) then that might be 2.4 DALYs or QALYs of benefit. This is probably a better way to measure transfusion impact than lives saved.	2018-01-17 04:31:36Z	David Bofinger	0

1287	8997	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/8997	There are three core factors that contribute to eye twitching:  If you’ve been noticing that your sleep has been disturbed or if you haven’t been getting enough of zzz time, you may expect daytime tiredness along with eye twitching. So if your eyelids have been bothering you lately, it may be wise to look at your sleep schedule.  is a popular stimulant many of us drink to stay alert. But sometimes that surge of energy not only keeps you awake, but also causes your eyes to twitch. If you consume lots of coffee or even energy drinks on a daily basis, you may want to cut back in order to minimize eye twitching. Keep in mind that smoking and alcohol consumption can contribute to eye twitching, too.  can play a large role in eye twitches, too. Stress-induced eye twitching can be more nerve-racking, as it may take place during important moments. For example, maybe you’re stressed out about putting a dinner party together. Well, now, not only are you trying to keep things under control, but your annoying eye twitch won’t stop either! All you can do here is handle stress at the best of your ability. And stop thinking about your eye twitch – otherwise, it will only add to the pressure of the moment. Relaxation techniques and other coping mechanisms should be utilized in order to lower stress, which in turn will reduce the eye twitch. Although these three factors are the most common causes for eyelid twitching, other causes include mineral deficiencies like lack of magnesium, dry eyes, eye strain from looking at a screen, incorrect eye glass prescription, allergies, alcohol consumption, smoking, an underlying eye problem, jaw clenching or teeth grinding. In some cases, eye twitching can be an early symptom of a serious medical condition including hypoglycemia, Parkinson’s disease, Tourette’s syndrome, and neurological dysfunction. If eye twitching worsens or is accompanied by other symptoms, you should see your doctor to determine the exact cause. Treatment options for eyelid twitching depend on the underlying cause. For example, if excessive caffeine is causing your eyelids to twitch, you may need to cut back on your favorite drink. If fatigue or stress is the cause, then more rest or effective stress-reducing remedies are needed. You may have to work towards getting more sleep, start drinking less caffeine, apply cold compresses to your eyes, make it a point to look away from screens often, reduce stress, use artificial tears and other eye drops, and ensure you are getting adequate nutrition. These are just some ways to address eyelid twitching, but treatment may vary based on the cause. Proper treatment of eyelid twitches may also aid with prevention. For example, if you are sleeping more and, therefore, are well rested, you may be able to get rid of your existing eye twitching problem and avoid future occurrences. Apply hot and cold compresses to the eyelid
Try acupuncture or massages to ease tension and reduce stress
Reduce stress as best as possible

1284	1303	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1303	I have eaten McDonalds for lunch every (week) day for the past 2+ years, I can tell you it has nothing to do with weight gain or loss. For the vast majority of people, losing and gaining weight is  ; nothing else. Genetics plays a role, but it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. There are many problems with the quality of food from McDonalds, but I will focus on answering your question within regards to weight gain/loss only. The foods at McDonalds are very calorie-dense, and non-satiating. One big mac has ~563 calories... add on the large fires (~480) and large coke (~310) with that and it equals over 1300 calories. + calories is an INSANE amount for one meal, which won't even keep you satiated (full) for very long.  Therefore, it's really a poor choice when it comes to weight loss.. because if you are trying to lose weight, your daily caloric intake wouldn't be too much higher than that (unless you're a bodybuilder or athlete). Some short women wouldn't even have 1300 calories total in their daily intake... that's how much calories that is. That being said, if you're on some kind of diet such as intermittent fasting, and you don't eat much else other than that single meal a day.. you can still successfully lose weight even if you eat this meal each day.	2015-06-19 18:34:00Z	JohnP	9
1284	1350	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1350	While it seems logical that you only need to consider the deficit or surplus on the energy balance to see if you'll gain or lose weight, this is not going to work because the body will regulate the metabolic rate to keep a certain amount of energy reserves. How much fat reserves your body decides to keep will depend on your physical fitness and physical activity levels, the intake of minerals that are essential for maintaining physical fitness, how much sleep you get etc. etc. In general, when you live an unhealthy lifestyle, your body's regulation of its metabolic rate will tend to lead to larger fat reserves. From a theoretical point of view, this is quite easy to understand. Whatever the precise biochemical mechanisms are that are involved in regulating metabolism (not everything is known), it remains the case that all these mechanisms have evolved in order to maximize survival probability of animals in Nature who  obviously don't do calorie counting. One of the problems evolution had to solve was how to make sure you don't starve to death due to a small shortage in the energy balance that you cannot make up for. Suppose you eat one sandwich a day worth 100 Kcal a day less and walk a bit more so that you expend 100 Kcal more per day. While this could lead to some weight loss, it cannot be the case that you'll continue to lose weight without limit. However, naive the calorie counting hypothesis suggests that a 200 Kcal deficit per day would lead to a long term weight loss trend of 1 kg of fat per 40 days. So, in a little over 2 years you would lose 20 kg of weight, which is clearly nonsense. Animals living in the wild may find themselves having to deal with a bit less food that is also a bit harder to find. If they were to lose weight because the metabolic rate is cannot be actively regulated, it would only increase due to physical exertion, the animal would be doomed. This doesn't make sense for warm blooded animals that we know have mechanisms to regulate the metabolic rate, and who have metabolic rates that are ten times higher than what they need to just barely survive. Instead, it makes far more sense to make the metabolic rate dependent on the degree to which the fat cells are filled. So, if there is a shortage on the energy balance, the animal will initially lose weight, but then the metabolic rate will be down regulated, correcting the energy balance, a slight surplus  will be created, allowing the fat cells to be filled.  While the biochemical mechanisms the body uses for this are not well understood, but recently   that fat cells produce leptin, the more filled a fat cell is the more leptin is produced and besides regulating the appetite, leptin will let the hypothalamus produce more TRH, and TRH will let the pituitary gland produce more TSH and TSH will let the thyroid gland produce more thyroid hormone. Then the body will likely also make the set point for the fat reserves dependent on factors such as the amount of food intake, stress levels, sleep etc. The whole point of the fat reserves is to maximize survival probability, so the probability of a food emergency, the time it can survive without food etc. will all influence the set point for its fat reserves. It then makes sense that the outcome of evolution would be that the set point would be set higher when the animal has less to eat, has more stress doesn't get the optimal; amount of sleep. In that case, a food emergency is more likely and when it happens it is less likely to survive on some given amount of fat reserves. So, the smart thing to do is to save more energy under these circumstances. In contrast, when you sleep better, eat more and exercise more, the body will think that the prospects of a food emergency are smaller, and if that were to happen you would be in stronger position to take measures to reverse the situation. So, you'll not keep as much fat reserves, because doing so does come at the cost of having to carry all that fat ballast with you all the time.	2015-06-22 15:59:50Z	Count Iblis	4

 So it seems that people often mix up Allergic Rhinitis (AR) and NAR so much, that even many cases of "AR" are actually still just NAR. So maybe people with AR have AR occurances   of NAR, and NAR to NR ratio is about 1-to-1. However, if we assume that all people have relatively the same number of NAR symptoms, then it seems likely that people with AR have at least slightly higher occurances of this symptom.	2018-02-18 05:19:43Z	Dave Liu	2

1276	1278	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1278	Great question! I think it's answerable as an overview, but please know this is only the tip of the iceberg.* : Yes, we have deficits of certain blood products in certain locations at certain times that affect patient care. However, a small percentage of blood product does expire unused (because it wasn't the   product [see background] in the   place at the   time).   Donated blood is not usually transfused into a patient as whole blood. Instead, it's broken down into several components which are transfused in different clinical scenarios. The issues of storage and supply are different for each component. The components are: These different components require different storage conditions, so they are separated as soon as possible after donation. : Yes. Well, actually your question is impossible to answer. :-) We could never know whether someone could-have-been-saved with a transfusion nor whether someone who received a transfusion would-have-died. Those are hypothetical constructs that are interesting to think about but are not compatible with research.  However, we   ask whether there is evidence that blood supply on a clinical level is limited, for instance:  All of these are more nuanced than they seem, but to some degree all do occur.  Quoting from a  : He further notes that this problem is likely to worsen because the requirement for transfusions (all types) is increasing at a rate of 5-7% per year while donations are not matching that increase. The first thing that happens when there is a blood bank shortage usually involves the Transfusion Medicine specialist in the blood bank having a conversation with every doctor who orders the blood product that is limited. Together they determine whether a smaller amount of product or a deferment in transfusion might be clinically appropriate/acceptable.  The distinction between those last two words —   — is the key to whether clinical care is actually being compromised. In many cases,  , because they feel that the patient's condition warrants it due to some special circumstance. It seems likely that at least a small percentage of the time, the clinician was right, but this can never be proven. It is also the case that   (see chart 8-1, p 43), although it's rare.  Although localized shortages of particular products do occur and are disruptive, it is true that a small percentage of the products expire unused. In the U.S., this was estimated at 14% of supply in 1989 and had fallen to 5.2% in 2011, per  , the most recent data available I've found. These are complicated and nuanced data that this format does not allow complete explanation of (and I myself am not completely familiar with), but please read   if interested. As for what happens to the excess - it's probably discarded, although I can't prove that. Regarding your question about research: In addition to being sub-optimal because it's old, the blood was originally collected from human donors. Such research would be subjected to IRB requirements for protection of human subjects. This would likely require researchers to obtain permission from donors (/subjects) at the time of donation to use the product for research. This may happen in localized settings, but I know of no large-scale project.	2015-06-17 18:36:56Z	Susan	22
1272	1280	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1280	The exercises you will actually do.  Crunches may require a lot of energy but how long can you actually keep them up? I doubt that many people could/would do crunches for more than 20-30 minutes at a time, at most. Meanwhile, most fit cyclists can ride a bike at a quick pace for 4-5 hours or more. I guarantee that a bike ride that long burns more calories than your crunches no matter how long you keep doing them. Ditto with running, swimming, and playing active sports like basketball, tennis, etc. In theory, calories are calories and it shouldn't matter how you burn them or reduce them in your diet. But I don't think it's that simple. In my experience, exercise in and of itself is not a highly effective way of losing weight (fat, not water). For example, in the warm months I usually ride my bike over 100 miles/160 km per week at fairly vigorous speeds. According to all the estimates I can find, I should be burning somewhere in the neighborhood of 3500 kcalories per week doing this. So I should be losing about a pound of fat per week if I keep my food intake the same, right? Unfortunately, I've found this is not the case for me or anyone else I know. In fact, not even close. Only when I combine exercise with a reduction of food intake do I see the weight loss I expect.  So my admittedly unscientific answer to your question is that any exercise that makes you break a sweat   will help the most, but it will only help if you combine it with a reasonable reduction in calorie intake.	2015-06-17 20:56:12Z	Carey Gregory	1

You've already identified that the cap in question is not really waterproof.  The best way (and really the only way) to keep water out of your ear is to stay out of the water until your ear has had time to clear the infection. To bathe, you can make a cheap waterproof ear plug by working a generous amount of petroleum jelly into a cotton ball, and using that as an earplug. You can also buy a special soft wax at most pharmacies. People roll a ball of the soft wax in their hands and press it into the outer ear.  Once the infection is healed, if you're not prone to such infections, you can use home-made or pharmacy bought ear drops after occasional swimming which will help maintain the proper environment to minimize infection in the ear. Use of a hair dryer on low to dry your ear is also useful. High-grade silicone ear plugs can be used once the ear is healed,  ,  , so swimmers (or people occupationally required or recommended to wear ear plugs) usually consult with ear specialists to work out the best plug to use which will not cause damage to the ear canal, something critical for prevention.	2015-06-16 17:51:14Z	anongoodnurse	6

As part of the initial settlement of that suit, a warning was posted at the entrance to each building referring to a two-page list of things that might reasonably be found in or around an apartment building -- not because the apartment had lead-based paint, or used perchloroethylene cleaners, or had asbestos insulation, but to prevent further lawsuits.	2015-06-19 01:20:54Z	Mark	8

I'll try to do my best to help with this, though I won't be able to give as much information as I'd like to, as you'll see. The California Proposition 65 list of hazardous substances is a highly-useful and informative list of hazardous substances that can show up in consumer goods (and medicines, and foods, etc.) It's a list to reference and take very seriously. Now, as for suitcases, it's hard to say if it's one particular substance, or possibly several. There is only one warning, "this contains a substance...", not and "this contains substances" plural. Maybe someone will come along and actually say what substance(s) are in suitcases. It could be lead, as lead is probably the most abused hazardous substance in products. You can research lead alone to determine the hazards, which have been well-documented and researched. The manufacturers obviously don't want people to know what's in their products, or they would have the guts to specify the hazardous substance(s). As consumers, we have the right to seek out manufacturers who won't put those substances in. It might take a little more searching, but those manufacturers are the ones who deserve to be rewarded, and deserve our business.	2017-04-23 01:19:05Z	John Washington	1

Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure. The trouble is, a normal blood pressure prevents the body from realizing it has inadequate blood volume and turns off its defensive measures, thus allowing the bleeding to continue unabated.  Left to fend for himself, a healthy adult would almost certainly survive having his penis removed. With modern medical care, that becomes a certainty. Could he still urinate? Sure, as long as the urethra wasn't blocked. It could become blocked by clotted blood, but eventually the pressure of a full bladder would overcome the blockage.	2015-06-17 21:37:12Z	Carey Gregory	19
1258	8820	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/8820	The problem is there are too many unknowns.  First, the speed of clotting varies from person to person.  There are lab tests that measure clotting time (e.g. INR), especially useful when a patient takes anticoagulants. One respondent mentioned the absence of anticoagulants, but anticoagulants include substances not specifically prescribed to reduce clotting, such as supplements and even food items that reduce clotting.  Further, there are genetic factors (i.e. Factor VIII and others) that modulate clotting time, operating independently of medical intervention/prescribed drugs or anything consumed.  Age is another facet in the clotting process, as infants often do not clot quickly.  Couple that fact with the smaller quantity of blood in an infant's body and it makes sense why some infants actually die from circumcision related bleeding.  An infant may retain his penis after circumcision but still die from operation related blood loss. Additionally, the penis is different than other appendages and extremities.  Besides the difference in tissue composition (smooth muscle vs. skeletal muscle elsewhere), penile arteries dilate more than arteries elsewhere and veins constrict more than veins elsewhere (assuming one has generally healthy blood vessels prior to injury).  The unique elasticity of penile blood vessels mean that a traumatic injury like penile amputation is more likely to bleed continuously than many other amputations when taking into account the relative area of tissue amputated and blood vessels severed.  Other than the femoral or carotid arteries, which, due to their own unique locations, are more likely to cause death from dissection than severing other arteries, the penis is again unique in that the arteries both inside and leading to it do not always clamp off- sometimes, they remain dilated even after a severing injury. One of the biggest factors of survival (a somewhat controllable factor) in this case is time.  The more time elapses after amputation without subsequent medical intervention, the more likely death becomes.    Death from penile amputation can arise not simply from blood loss but also from related issues such as overall stress and pain.  Stress hormones and an inflammatory chemical cascade following such a traumatic injury can overwhelm the heart.       	2016-08-13 10:04:38Z	Nona	2

Think of it as a shock absorber.  Most movement of teeth happens due to pressure that is applied to your teeth (ex: biting when eating) but also when an orthodontist slowly moves the teeth into place by having the orthodontic wire push and pull your teeth in a certain way for a long time.  Wearing a retainer is important, to prevent the teeth from returning to the way they were before wearing braces. The periodontal ligament has a certain memory and will tend to "spring" back to where it was before. 2)   Here is an example of what an orthodontist might tell you: "Some retainers are used full-time for the first 6 months; after that, the retainers are worn only at night, for a few years.

 The labels are not described in the text in detail and the reference in the caption does not include this picture. Picture is a work by one JW Dietrich and I also searched PubMed for this guy, but he has no works on this topic.  Another more pragmatic picture is here. Fever or increased body temperature is almost solely caused by to the production  . PGE2 acts on the hypothalamus or the thermoregulator of the body and as a result body temperature increases ( ). PGE2 production is controlled by the immune system. Fever is meant to have a good cause since fever is supposed to help killing the bacteria or viruses causing any illness. Antipyretics are drugs which interact with PGE2. Basically they suppress the formation of PGE2. In that way they "treat" the fever. As can be seen from the control circuit describing the thermoregulation PGEs has nothing to with this process. Due to this, blocking non existing PGE2 production during normal body temperature has no effect whatsoever which would cause the body temperature to drop. Even it would happen with some mysterious cause, the body rapidly balance the situation as seen above in the figures.	2015-08-30 12:55:41Z	arkiaamu	3

1248	1257	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1257	Yes, mortality benefits for blood pressure medicine have been demonstrated in trials. Let me just preface this by saying this was much harder to find than I was expecting. Questioning the benefit of blood pressure reduction is medical heresy, so you'd think you wouldn't have trouble finding the data out there. First of all, let's define the question. We're asking whether treatment of hypertension leads to lower mortality in the setting of a randomized clinical trial. Reading between the lines, I think what we really want to know is whether treatment of isolated hypertension (i.e. in patients that have no strokes, heart failure or other diseases associated with hypertension) leads to lower mortality in a randomized clinical trial. Treating hypertension after a stroke or heart attack is hands down beneficial (see HOPE, PART2, IDNT, NICOLE or PREVENT trials [1-5]). You can't answer the question with this data though, because maybe the drug is really just treating the heart attack or stroke.  To get data specifically on treating hypertension itself, not in the setting of other medical problems, you have to go back to the 1960s. The VA COOP Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents [6,7] trial specifically looked at treating people who just came into the clinic with high blood pressure. Mortality was 5% lower in the treatment group, or, for every 20 people treated for 3.3 years (the average time people were enrolled in the study), 1 person will have their life saved. Honestly, this is a pretty good outcome as far as drugs go, taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks doesn't work nearly as well, for example. The authors collected these numbers on mortality but they didn't test for whether the numbers were likely to have just popped up by chance or not (statistical significance). I crunched them myself with Fisher's exact test and the results were unlikely to have just come up by chance (p value = 0.015)  Some caveats. This study was old (the word negro is used), but it was really well done. They had the patients go through a 2 month run in phase where they had to take pills that turned their urine orange just so they could see whether they took their pills regularly before letting them in the trial. All the patients and the doctors were blinded. They used sealed envelope randomization. Patients were enrolled from eight different sites. Of course, it was done at the VA in the 60s, so every single patient was a man. Also, the patients weren't exactly free of other diseases. For some reason, the authors didn't just say how many patients had strokes or heart attacks in the past. They devised this "severity score" to assess how many health problems people had at the start of the trial. The score went from 0-4 and on average the patients were less than 1. I would say most weren't very sick. Some other trials tried to test blood pressure medicines versus placebo but fell short. The Australian Therapeutic Trial in Mild Hypertension [8] had many fewer events than the VA study so weren't quite able to show statistical significance. The benefits to treatment that they measured in this study were way smaller. Treatment reduced death by .15%. So for every 666 people taking the drug for 1 year, 1 person's life would be saved. They were only able to show this was statistically significant when they looked at the numbers for people actually taking the drug. You want to look at everyone that entered the study in the first place though (intention to treat), because you can always invent scenarios where you get biased results if you don't do this.  There was one other study that looked at this question. The Oslo study [9] also failed to show that treatment actually saved lives when treating patients with just hypertension. Keep in mind that all of these studies were able to show benefit to treating (fewer strokes, less kidney failure) but mortality was really only lower in the VA trial. My gut tells me that this was because aged American veterans were less healthy to start with then relatively healthy Norwegians and Australians (the population from the other studies). It was less of a needle-in-a-haystack challenge in the VA trial. Sometime in the 70s or 80s, it seems that doctors all decided that treating hypertension was the way to go no matter how healthy the patient was otherwise so we don't have any more studies.

1248	1254	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1254	Yes.  This is one of the few areas of  * where the data are clear.  The (intelligently) skeptical tone of your question suggests to me that you would be (appropriately) wary of drawing conclusions based on   or  . Fortunately, you have asked a question about an area where rigorous data are available showing reductions in the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality on the basis of randomized, controlled trials.   In large-scale randomized trials of people with primary hypertension,  antihypertensive therapy produces a nearly 50 percent relative risk reduction in the incidence of heart failure, a 30 to 40 percent relative risk reduction in stroke, and a 20 to 25 percent relative risk reduction in myocardial infarction.   The benefits show a consistent "dose-response" relationship. That is, larger improvements in blood pressure control are associated with greater decreases in risk. This is an important point, since it adds credibility to the association. This is demonstrated in graphs like this one:   On the x-axis you see the degree of blood pressure lowering achieved with medications. On the y-axis is “relative risk” (RR). By definition, a null intervention yields RR=1. A relative risk of 0.5 represents a 50% decreased risk, etc.  The graph is showing meta-analysis data, i.e. data compiled from many clinical trials in order to increase statistical power. The basic idea is that each circle is a clinical trial and bigger circles represent “stronger” data (i.e. with lower variance). The regression line shows that there is a linear relationship between the degree of blood pressure lowering and the relative risk reduction (here for a composite endpoint of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.) This analysis included 31 randomized, placebo-controlled trials, with 190,606 participants. These are strong data.    In addition to the dramatic reductions in adverse cardiovascular outcomes, blood pressure control has also been shown to reduce mortality. One meta-analysis used data from 42 randomized, controlled studies including nearly 200,000 subjects (Psaty). They found a reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96). The fact that these relative risk (RR) confidence intervals do not cross 1 demonstrates statistical significance.  Although the RR value of 0.90 is considerably less impressive than the reductions in more specific outcomes (stroke, heart failure, etc), this is expected due to the myriad of other factors affecting mortality. A statistically significant relative risk of 0.90 for   is actually quite dramatic. One would be challenged to find any other intervention for primary prevention that, in randomized trials, can be shown to decrease overall mortality with this degree of certainty.   There are many interventions in modern medicine that are of questionable long-term benefit to healthy patients (i.e. primary prevention).** These include cholesterol lowering medications, aspirin, various forms of cancer screening, etc. In most cases, the disease-specific improvements in outcomes are subtle and debated, and randomized data showing a reduction in overall mortality are lacking or inconsistent. The use of blood pressure lowering medications in patients with hypertension falls into a different category. These medications are effective.     	2015-06-14 04:07:46Z	Community	4

It reminds me of this amusing quote by Henry David Thoreau: Also,     to be saying that vegetables can supply as much calcium as milk: But the intake of calcium is just part of the equation - calcium is also lost by excretion, which is what makes oisteoporosis possible. Many studies, such as   entitled "Excess dietary protein can adversely affect bone", report that high consumption of protein in the diet leads to increased excretion of calcium due to the acids formed in the metabolism of protein. Finally, an   published on Harvard's own website considers the 1,000-1,200 mg RDA for calcium recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, which were based on short-term studies, and raises them to question based on long-term studies: The article describes several more studies that found no benefit to bone strength from high milk consumption.	2015-07-15 23:34:19Z	Chris Jenks	4
1247	1604	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1604	According to  , adults need a bit more than 1 gram of calcium per day. However, it may be the case that the natural vitamin D levels for the human body should be a lot higher than what is currently the norm, see e.g.  . Calcium is absorbed from the gut by both passive and active mechanisms, the active mechanism is vitamin D dependent. If the level of calcium in the blood drops then calcium from bones will be released and simultaneously, the kidneys will produce more calcitriol which then turns on genes in the gut to produce enzymes that help to extract calcium from food. Besides the total intake per day, what is also relevant is the presence of big gaps in the intake of calcium. Such gaps will prompt the body to extract calcium from the bones and then you're dependent on processes that will eventually put  calcium back into the bones. By spreading the intake of calcium over the day, you can prevent bone loss in the event that in your case this mechanism of putting the calcium back doesn't work as well as it should. Note that there are many sources of calcium that we tend to ignore. Water can contain calcium, e.g. where I live there is 60 mg per liter. That doesn't sound like a lot, but if you drink 3 liters a day, you'll get 180 mg. Bread only contains 10 mg per slice, but if you eat a lot like I do (I don't recommend doing that unless it fits into a well balanced diet for your case) like 15 slices per day, then that's 150 mg of calcium. So, the dry bread plus water alone is already 280 mg. Then if you eat 500 grams of broccoli at dinner like I did today, you'll get 235 mg of calcium. Potatoes contain 12 mg per 100 gram, I had 1 kg of potatoes for dinner, so I got 120 mg from the potatoes. This means that in total I got more than 600 mg of calcium from sources one normally doesn't bother to consider. However, it must be said that absorption of calcium from such sources isn't as efficient as from dairy products due to oxalates in vegetables, phytic acids in grains and the lack of phosphorous when you drink just plain water. So, you see that non dairy sources can give you a decent amount of calcium, but you then need to eat a lot (I eat about 4000 kcal per day, which is a lot more than average). The calorie intake of indigenous people who needed to jog for hours every day to chase prey was likely a lot higher than what it is today for the typical office worker, so they may actually have gotten their gram of calcium per day from only non dairy foods and their vitamin D levels were also likely a lot higher than that of the average office worker. 	2015-07-19 04:34:44Z	Count Iblis	3

You say you noticed the weight gain when all your sports ended. That does tell you something. Eating to maintain energy and strength during sports is physiological. Eating the same amount once you stop engaging in that sport is going to add weight. There are all kinds of diets out there which, usually for monetary reasons, claim superiority over one another. You don't need to read about or follow any one specific diet to lose weight. If you decrease caloric intake over a sufficient period of time, you will lose weight. One approach you can take is to eat the same stuff you eat right now, but eat less of it. If you eat a Wendy's Baconator for lunch on Saturdays, leave some of it uneaten. Leave a third of your shake, a third of your fries, etc. At home, eat a smaller portion of everything equally. If you consume sweets, like soda or other nutritionally empty calories, cut them out or cut them back. Exercise. Take walks, take hikes, ride a bike. A male your age probably plays video games. Cut back on these, and do something which exercises your body instead (it doesn't matter what; listening to your summer reading list on audiotape while walking/bicycling/etc. will do the job.) Learn to swim if you don't already know, and keep in shape this summer by swimming regularly. If you have medical problems, have other symptoms of concern other than just weight gain (e.g. fatigue, constipation, a change in your voice/hoarseness, weakness, etc.), or any other symptoms of concern, see a doctor. If, after an   was made to lose weight, you are unable to, you can see a doctor for more specialized help and to determine if you need testing.	2015-06-13 17:31:08Z	anongoodnurse	3

First and for most you need to change your lifestyle, you said that maybe it is because of ending your sports and hobbies. Well absolutely it really accounts to that, you should bring back yourself being a sporty person. Aside from that, start drinking more water before a meal and right after or before your game/workout. Being healthy will start from the kitchen, you should eat healthy foods and stop eating in fast food chains, stop eating pizzas, burgers, avoid drinking alcohol and soft drinks because it only worsens your situation, they must go. 
Since you are overweight, I suggest you take a walk every morning for about 40 minutes to 80 minutes, in that way you'll starting to lose weight slowly but surely. If you can improve it much better like walk for 40 minutes and run for 20 minutes do it on a regular basis Monday to Saturday and rest during Sundays. 
Try to beat your own records and increase the number of minutes and your speed gradually.
If you feel that you can do more exercises, try to add these exercises at home to lose more weight like jumping jacks, push-ups, sit-ups, squat and etc..

The combination of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate are routinely used in effervescent tablets designed for human consumption (according to Wikipedia ;). Citric acid is commonly found in many fruit juices and many soft drinks we consume have an acidic pH. I found an article that looks specifically at citric acid compared with artificial saliva.  The study found that citric acid had a negative affect on tooth wear compared with artificial saliva. I would be cautious trying to relate these results to something like drinking an effervescent multivitamin solution though; the tooth exposure to citric acid was probably longer than if you just drank a solution and especially if you washed your mouth and brushed your teeth after. So to recap: So effervescent tablets containing citric acid is worse than saliva for your teeth, but how much of an effect it would have especially with infrequent use I can't really say.

Then adjust the looseness/tightness of the cuff, the position, etc., until you get matching BP's consistently. Accurate BP measurements depend on a number of things, but one that is really important is the rate at which the cuff deflates. If it deflates too quickly, it will give you falsely low BP's, in addition to BP's "all over the place" (some accurate, some not, some with a normal systolic pressure, but an abnormal diastolic pressure, etc. If you can't find out what's wrong by correlating with manual BP readings, the apparatus is unreliable, therefore worthless.	2015-06-11 19:14:36Z	anongoodnurse	6
1218	1228	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1228	The timing of the first defibrillation attempts depends mostly on when defibrillation is detected. If it is witnessed - that is, the patient is being monitored and the alarm goes off, you're right there at the bedside, and the patient is in V Fib, it's fine to shock first. However, whereas this used to be the norm - shock first - it no longer is, partly because the goals of CPR and ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) are changing. A bit over a decade ago, the goal was restoration of a perfusing rhythm.  The new Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines call for CPR to be initiated immediately, assuming the paddles aren't right there and ready to go the moment someone goes into VFib. It needs to be noted, though, that this recommendation does not rest on defibrillation with the aim of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), but on improved neurological outcomes.  If the heart is in V Fib, there is no effective blood circulation; the heart and all the other organs are starving for oxygen. While setting up to defibrillate, the hypoxia continues, and the damage becomes more severe, especially to sensitive tissue like the brain. Compressions circulate blood; even blood with lower oxygen saturation is better than none. The brain is less hypoxic, then, and neurological outcomes improve if defibrillation is successful. This, not ROSC, is what the new ACLS recommendations are based on, because ACLS is not considered highly successful if the patient leaves the hospital only to be hospitalized elsewhere in a persistent vegetative state. And CPR first has been shown to provide better neurological outcomes.

The problem is that your urine is a way to remove superfluous minerals and other stuff from the body. The body's job, especially in a state of dehydration, is to remove this waste with the least amount of water sufficient to flush it away.  If you then drink this urine, you are ingesting back all the salts you just got rid of. You are not getting your liquid-to-salts ratio better, you are making it worse. So when you are already dehydrated, you get dehydrated even quicker if you drink your urine.  If you are at no risk of dehydration (you can additionally ingest sufficient water from drinks or food), then the above does not apply. As long as you don't have an urinary tract infection, your urine is also sterile, so you are not at risk of infection either. This makes urine safe to drink.  There are people who drink urine (outside of dehydration situations) for supposed health benefits, but I have never heard of any evidence that such benefits exist.  I don't know of peer reviewed sources for this, but the dangers of drinking urine for survival are both logical from a theoretical view point and common knowledge in outdoor lore, for example see  .  The   site has the same question, with a suggestion for a possible purification method which might remove the dissolved minerals. But urine is also rich in organic compounds and starts breeding bacteria almost immediately upon leaving your body. So I'd be weary to try it: fresh urine is safe, but urine which has stood around at room temperature isn't. 	2015-06-10 21:34:28Z	Community	7
1205	1212	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1212	The first ingredient is water; the second ingredient is a detergent (milder than SLS). The next ingredients are Shea Butter and sunflower seed oil (good for the skin), then a humectant (attracts moisture from the air to the skin), then another surfactant/detergent - very, very mild, then a thickener/foam enhancer (people don't like to wash up with stuff that doesn't make bubbles), then  , one of my all-time favorite ingredients for skin care, then the rest are in amounts at or under 1% and are mostly to increase shelf life/prevent bacteria from growing in the product. If that doesn't seem like an answer to you, I'll put it in plain English, but first an aside. The Romans (well,   limited to the middle class and up), who had soap to wash garments with, did not use soap on their skin. Instead, they bathed in hot water, then were coated with an infused olive oil (say, lavender), then the oil was scraped from their skin with a scraper, taking away the old and (?)foul smelling, and leaving behind some of the nicer, new stuff. A couple of additional steps and they were clean. That was good skin care. No one today washes that way. It would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming. By habit, many people would not feel clean, either, because they equate "bubbles" with "clean". Your Cetaphil is trying to do that - replace oil removed with oil deposited - while still foaming and acting as a wash, which people expect. First, soap and detergent are different things. I'll assume you mean soap. A very high quality soap (which you can't buy commercially) will attempt to do the same thing by   the soap using oils with a great skin care profile: Jojoba oil, Macademia Nut oil, Shea butter, Cocoa butter, etc. to the point of almost not foaming (no bubbles). You would find the Cetaphil and the soap would leave you feeling about the same. Regualar soap strips the skin of all fats and sweat, dirt, etc. Then you replace the oils stripped with new oils and the other ingredients in your moisturizer. Does it matter? You can answer that yourself. In one scenario, you strip your skin of oils then add them back. In another, you have some good oils on your skin and you add to that. Which sounds healthier for your skin?	2015-06-10 17:53:50Z	anongoodnurse	4
1202	1240	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1240	Before I answer your question:   Your ointment should have an expiration date. You should not use it past that date. Not just that microbiological quality can't be guaranteed after that much time (not even with phenol which might have preserved it to a point, but not for 40 years), but also the chemical composition might have changed - both the active substances and the excipients might have underwent various chemical reactions - and no one can say with any certainty what you've got in there now. Now, onto your question:    It depends on the ingredient. The   is important because both safety and efficacy/effectiveness depend on it. Some ingredients have a very wide range of concentrations in which they are proven to be both safe and effective; others have a very narrow range of concentrations in which they should/(are recommended to) be used; some are somewhere in between. You are asking about an ointment with lesser concentrations of active substance than the one you previously used, so the efficacy of the 'new' ointment is what you are concerned with.  Phenol is used as an antiseptic in your ointments. The efficacy of antiseptics depends on many factors including: So, the concentration is important, but there are other factors to be taken into account.  According to Martindale, The Complete Drug Reference (34th edition), the Phenol monograph: Both ointments you used contain phenol in bacteriostatic (inhibits growth of bacteria) and not bacteriocidal (kills bacteria) concentrations.  There is various research on a MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) of phenol: According to   G. McDonnell, A. D. Russell From the same source (based on references 226 and 440 provided in that research paper): In    Heribert Keweloh, Hermann-Josef Heipieper, Hans-Jürgen Rehm have used solutions of phenol in both 1 g/l (0.1%) and 2 g/l (0.2%) concentrations and got inhibition of growth of some bacteria (although they were testing something else, and I can't access the whole article).   It is used in concetrations of up to 50% (Deutscher Arzneimittel Codex – DAC), but technical literature doesn't specify a minimal concentration at which it should be used.  (Using more most likely wouldn't enhance the efficacy anyway).

Please note that it is very difficult (if not impossible) to directly compare concentrations in in an ointment (especially a lipid-based one) and in water or aqueous medium. The ultimate burden of testing the efficacy is on the manufacturer; the ultimate burden of ensuring that such tests have been conducted and gave sufficient results in on the regulatory agency responsible for a certain market.

1201	1203	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1203	This question arises from your (correct) understanding that administration of exogenous (i.e. not produced by the body) glucocorticoids (GCs) can suppress the body’s ability to produce its own GCs in the adrenal glands. In order to understand the answer, a little background is necessary. 
As in many endocrine systems, negative feedback maintains homeostasis. Exogenous GCs exert negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (a series of hormones starting in the hypothalamus) that normally stimulates GC production in the adrenals. This negative feedback is almost immediately reversible. However, with extended administration of exogenous GCs, the lack of stimulation via the HPA axis leads to atrophy of the adrenal gland, and it becomes unable to produce the horomone  . Your question is,  It’s a very practical question because it affects how doctors prescribe steroids.   adrenal suppression is expected, they must be tapered slowly.  , a “burst” can be administered and then immediately stopped. Because it’s such a practical question, people thought to study it quite a while ago, and the relevant literature is mostly pretty old (relative to most biomedical data, at least). (See below.) The time required to achieve suppression depends upon:     : The degree of suppression in this intermediate group is related to individual metabolism parameters that are not (yet!) established in a way that can be measured and used clinically.   The rule of thumb I learned (which is fairly conservative): >10 mg for >3 weeks requires tapering.   In those patients who fall into the uncertain category, there is something called a "cosyntropin stimulation test” that helps make the distinction. In this test, a doctor administers a hormone (cosyntropin, a.k.a. ACTH) that stimulates the adrenal gland and measures plasma cortisol concentrations to see if it responds appropriately. I’ve been talking in prednisone “equivalents.” There are   around. In general, prednisolone and prednisone have a 1:1 dosing relationship.  The answer to your question, then, is  . Seven days is a common prescription for a steroid “burst”, and tapering is generally considered to be unnecessary.         	2015-06-09 14:28:01Z	Community	6

Since your example is of hard liquor, there would be damage to the mouth and esophagus not present from consumption of more dilute solution. Although beyond the scope of your question, many people would consider changes like habituation to the effects and long-term tolerance, and even "developing an acquired taste" which could increase the propensity for alcoholism, to be harmful.  of two hospitalized toddlers found that their alcohol consumption was somewhat under 20 mL for the first one (who drank an acetaminophen elixir) and 2 to 7 mL for the second one (who drank mouthwash and collapsed). So it seems that toddlers are more sensitive to the depressant effect of alcohol than adults per kg of body weight, and that it is feasible for them to drink enough alcohol to suffer respiratory arrest. There is a whole   on reddit discussing your very question. None of the answers were satisfyingly quantitative, but people pointed out that some pediatric medications contain ethanol (which should make it possible to calculate a "sanctioned" dose), that people in France and other places have a history of giving a little alcohol to young children, that ethanol is a metabolite (rum flavoring) or additive (flavoring extracts) in some foods, that it forms spontaneously in sugar-containing foods like juice and that it can form naturally in the intestine. So any of these approaches should make it possible to estimate a "normal" exposure of toddlers to ethanol, if not a "safe" one.	2015-07-13 19:59:20Z	Community	3
1196	1200	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1200	As you alluded to in the question, medications used for migraine headaches generally fall into two categories,   (meds taken daily to prevent migraines) and   (meds taken when a migraine starts in order to stop it). Your question is about the second group. “Instantly” (as noted in the comments) is a little absurd; there is obviously some delay between the time of ingestion of the medication and its effect at receptors that provides relief of pain. However, you’re right to note that the time-to-onset of anti-migraine effect is relevant, and this is a case where the available medications do vary in this respect in a way that tempers their usefulness.    Medications taken   (by mouth) are generally the slowest to onset of action. Intravenous medications, introduced directly into the bloodstream, are generally the fastest. Perhaps less well-known are other methods that are nearly as fast as IV:  ,  , and  . In each of these cases, the medication is placed in apposition to blood vessels that are able to absorb it directly. This only works for certain types of medications (mostly   ones that can cross into blood vessels), but it’s fast and avoids some of the difficulties of oral administration.   ,   or   administration is generally also somewhat quicker to reach the bloodstream than oral medications.   For reasons that are not fully understood, abortive medications are more effective when used early in the attack, so the quicker routes of administration are also expected to provide relatively more benefit. In addition, migraine headaches are often associated with severe nausea and vomiting which may limit the utility of oral medications. Even when vomiting is not present, migraines are associated with gastric stasis, meaning that the stomach is slow to empty into the duodenum, the part of the gut where medications are generally absorbed.

1192	1224	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1224	Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. The heart rate (HR) is the number of heart beats in some unit time (generally expressed as the number of beats per minute). In general, because measures of HR are an average over time, it will smooth out the variability in the heart rate. The amount of HRV cannot be estimated from a measure of the HR at a single time point. Estimating the amount of HRV from multiple measures of HR at different times is possible, but will be corrupted by changes in the average heart rate over time. So in summary, no HRV cannot be estimated from measures of HR.	2015-06-11 14:22:24Z	StrongBad	1
1191	1225	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1225	There is an adage in electrical safety that "It is not the voltage that kills you, it is the current". This was investigated at  . A review of literature regarding electrocution suggests  . That said, because of Ohm's law, voltage does play a role. Ohm's law says that V=IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.  measured R for the human body under various conditions (dry, damp, and with a metal ring) and calculated the various voltages needed to get lethal currents based on 17 mA across the chest being lethal. With clean dry skin you would need a voltage of 20 kV while with damp skin you need 340 V to kill you. If you are in contact with metal (e.g., wearing a ring), lethal currents can be generated at as low as 17 V. Even in the worst case scenario of a foot immersed in a conductive liquid with a total resistance of 100 Ohm, would mean that you would require 1.7 V to get a lethal current. With a 2V, 30 mA, AC power supply, under the right (or wrong) conditions, you could deliver an immediately lethal shock in excess of 17 mA across the chest. If we assume 100 Ohm is the lowest possible resistance, despite the 30 mA source, we are limited to 20 mA at 2 V. The exact impact of 20 mA will depend on the frequency of the source (AC and DC are different and 60 Hz AC is different from 10 kHz AC). With 20 mA at 60 Hz, you would probably lose voluntary muscle control and have pain (possibly sever) and would probably begin experiencing difficulty breathing.	2015-06-11 14:40:57Z	Community	2

1180	1199	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1199	Like almost all products, there are some side effects that come with using chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (CGM). Luckily, they are usually very minor and the ones that are more serious are extremely rare. WebMD  lists some of the common side effects of using CGM, such as teeth and mouth discoloration, taste problems, and an increase of tartar formation in the teeth. There are also more serious side effects that can come from using CGM, but these are mostly allergic reactions to its ingredients and are very rare. The FDA  has also said that serious allergic allergic reactions can occur from using products with chlorhexidine gluconate. There are studies that agree with the information that WebMD has said. Many of them are older, but the results of them are still reliable. A 1988 study  testing out the difference between 0.1% and 0.2% CGM. It found that with both there were possible minor side effects like discoloration and loss of taste. The only noticeable difference between the two is that the test subjects preferred the taste of the 0.1% CGM. There are also two studies from the 1980's    that suggest that CGM can also cause gingival bleeding. The studies did notice a slight increase in the frequency of gingival bleeding when using CGM as opposed to mechanical oral care. Though there are side effects that can occur from using CGM, they are most likely not going to be very severe. Also, it is most likely that the benefits of using CGM will outweigh the risks. A 2006 study on both topical chlorhexidine gluconate and CGM  found that the topical and mouthrinse both helped treat plaque and prevent gingivitis when used properly. Odds are, your dentist told you to use CGM because of the swelling of your gums, a sign of gingivitis. It is more than likely that the benefits of you using CGM will outweigh the risks. If you really are worried about getting bad side effects from CGM, ask your doctor and try to find out if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.	2015-06-09 11:23:49Z	michaelpri	3

1170	1182	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1182	There hasn't been any conclusive clinical studies that have found that vibrating belts, or any vibration exercise for that matter, can definitely help promote weight loss. Sadly, most studies have been done on full body vibration training, so some of the references I point to may not be specifically about vibration belts, but the mechanisms of each method are basically the same. A review of several studies  on vibration exercise in general, including the use of vibration belts, found that vibration exercise was not very efficient in burning fat. It wasn't found to be very good at promoting weight loss or changing the body composition at all (ie: building muscle). One study did show possible signs that vibration exercise and vibration belts can burn fat, but overall, the rate at which fat is burned at when using a vibration belt or other form of vibration exercise is low. There are some possible benefits of vibration exercise, such as higher oxygen intake. This review did not provide fully conclusive results, though. Another review of many studies on whole-body vibration training  found similar results, though they did point more in the favor of vibration exercise having benefits. The review states in its conclusion that: This review shows more positive results than the other review I mentioned that vibration training may promote weight loss, especially when used in conjunction with other exercises meant to help you lose weight. Vibration exercise does appear to be safe, though, so it can be used with a weight loss diet and exercises to help promote weight loss. Though this review was about whole-body vibration training, vibration belts work in a similar fashion, so it is likely that vibration belts may produce similar results.	2015-06-08 05:35:06Z	michaelpri	2

As a vegetarian for health purposes (who was a vegan for 1 year) I say that the human isn't supposed to be vegetarian, but rather an opportunistic omnivore. The fact that we can eat meat doesn't mean we have to. Most of people that went from non-vegetarian to vegetarian (no meat, no fish) felt better the following weeks, however the reasons could be numerous and ambiguous: Anyway, most of meat and fish's nutrients we need to live healthy are proven to be in eggs and milk with enough quantities. Concerning the vegans (no eggs, no milk), the most recurrent problem is about the vitamin B12 that is very hardly obtained in vegan food, it can be found in some mushrooms, but in most cases you'll have to eat 4kg of that a day to fulfill your daily needs. It can also be found in some algaes and supplements like spirulina, but in that form it is nearly impossible for the body to be absorbed. Even though you might feel better the first year of veganism, you might be sick later on, even though some vegans never become sick. It also depends of the genes of each person. Some African ethnicities have evolved eating a lot of meat per day and still they remain healthier than most of people from Western countries. On the other hand, most Romans from the antiquity were eating less than 1kg of meat per month. I think that the best way to find how being vegetarian is good for you is to try it out by yourself, pay attention at how you feel, and have regular blood tests.

1162	1177	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1177	This is a very interesting question. It's also highly speculative, and vague (what does "a doctor... gives them any medicine necessary to protect them from other diseases that might be lurking in their body" mean? Does it mean they treat the symptoms of AIDS (weight loss, diarrhea, etc?) If it does, then the difference between not treating HIV but treating every complication stretches this almost to the point of meaninglessness. If you are postulating treating all diseases, then I do believe this is speculative at best and unanswerable. The most likely scenario is that the patient would eventually die (but don't we all?) How he would die is pure speculation. Unfortunately, while you can place a patient in a sterile environment, 
- 1) you can't sterilize a patient 
- 2) yt's exceedingly difficult to sterilize food 
- 3) to prevent all possible hospital acquired bacterial infections, they would need a bubble-boy-like unit (very rare and extremely expensive) 
- 4) you can't predict if some previously unknown virus dormant in our bodies will be able to express itself. (See @Fomite's comment.) The fact that you stipulate treatment for everything but the virus that replicates in certain blood cells associated with immunity is almost an aside if you're going to treat all pathogens.  Every bacteria and virus he has in his body will go into that sterile environment with him, so it depends what he has going in. When he no longer has enough immune competency to keep these under control, they will take their toll. If you treat him in a sterile environment and give him world-class treatment of all infections (anti-virals would be needed to treat herpesvirus recurrences, like chicken pox and HSV1, HCV, HepBV, or any other number of viruses one can carry, treat the encephalitis that comes with HSV/etc. He has a small chance of possibly outliving the disease, only to die in the 3-5 days after you turn him out, unless you include bone marrow transplant in the treatment as well. The progress of HIV to AIDS is variable. Less than 0.5% of patients never develop any sign whatsoever of the infection except for undeniably positive titers. What if your patient is in this small but not-nonexistent subtype?  Then there are almost everything in between, with fewer patients on the healthy end than the sick end. My best guess: your patient will die of some ultimately unconquerable disease you are treating in the bubble, for example, multi-drug resistant C. diff, Kaposi's sarcoma, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Toxoplasmosis (Up to 50% of the world's human population is estimated to carry Toxoplasma) liver failure from rampant Epstein-Barr, or some other opportunistic infection from something he carried in there but is either devastating or drug resistant. You're asking if the virus will just "die" out, effectively curing the patient. That's kind of like letting the heart and lungs die, but keeping the patient alive on a heart-lung bypass machine. That's not a cure, and upon turning it off, the patient will die. And that's purely a guess, which, on SE, makes it worthless.	2015-06-07 18:52:27Z	anongoodnurse	7

HIV doesn't infect all immune cells. It infects  , which are used for adaptive immunity. There are two features of HIV infections that make your scenario impossible or almost impossible: In some people with AIDS, the number of CD4 cells counted in  , which would be as close to your scenario as people can get and it still doesn't make them cured. The "viral load" measured in these patients is usually very high. Remember that HIV needs human cells to  , not to  . It will happily exist in an individual with no CD4 cells. That person can infect others and because the immune system can't replenish the CD4 cells fast enough (and they get infected soon after being produced) the immune system just stays very, very weak.  The stem cell therapy approach to HIV was mentioned in comments, so I'd like to address that. It's not as "easy" as just doing a bone marrow transplant. The new cells would just get infected.

Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulators (TENS) use electrotherapy to   and active therapeutic healing.

EMS units are used to prevent atrophied muscles, for retraining muscles (e.g. in partial paralysis), to increase range of motion, and other uses.  Some of the technology is described  .  Both types of therapies are convenient, in that they're used at home, and the patient controls the dose, generally by way of either a knob or a switch. Electrodes are user-replaceable, though placement instructions are given and monitored by a physician or physical therapist. TENS units also have a "burst" feature, enabling the patient intermittent increases, which is helpful after strenuous activity or if you're just having a bad day. I personally found that feature very helpful! A Yale University study entitled  (Yale J Biol Med. 2012) discussing electrical stimulation (ES), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and functional electrical stimulation (FES) states that the potential that electrical stimulation holds for rehabilitation recovery is immeasurable. It is used to improve muscle strength, increase range of motion, reduce edema, decrease atrophy, heal tissue, and decrease pain.

So-called "asymptomatic shedding", when the virus can be transmitted despite the carrier not showing any sores, is very common in both herpes types.  A good article on this is  . It gives an overview over several studies, for example one where 144 heterosexual couples where only one partner was infected were tracked.

This is a condition called Oral Allergy Syndrome, also known as Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome.  This is caused by a reaction to foods that contain similar ingredients or proteins to the type of pollen they are allergic to. So while this allergy is a bit different than just a regular pollen allergy, it is likely that, if you have a pollen allergy, there will be foods that trigger the same symptoms you may get from your pollen allergies. There are a few common types of pollen allergies that have foods associated with them. Ragweed allergy, which is caused by the pollen of ragweed and mainly causes symptoms like sneezing, itchy throat, stuffy/runny nose, and possible trouble breathing. Some of the foods that may cause these symptoms include watermelons, cantaloupes, bananas, and honey. A birch pollen allergy is also a common allergy which has many symptoms similar to those of ragweed allergy. Foods which many trigger those symptoms are kiwi, pears, apples, plums, cherries, carrots, and almonds. Grass pollen allergy is the other common type of pollen allergy and its symptoms, which are also like ragweed and birch allergy symptoms, can be triggered by foods like tomatoes, celery, peaches, and oranges. To help avoid the above mentioned foods, you can try many things, such as cooking the food or peeling it, if it is possible.	2015-06-06 02:30:46Z	michaelpri	3

Swallowing the average gnat should be completely painless, as should swallowing the average mosquito, as neither should be releasing any (or many) noxious chemicals to irritate one's oropharynx. Some insects when swallowed do sting defensively, and can cause significant problems; I would include spiders and hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants, etc.) in this group. Some insects (such as blister beetles, hairy spiders such as tarantulas, and certain hairy caterpillars, among others) have irritating toxins on them which can cause significant problems with swallowing (tarantula is considered a delicacy in some parts of the world, and this has caused such problems.) However, to the average person, mosquitoes and gnats should not present much of a problem. It's possible that if someone is extremely hypersensitive to mosquito saliva, the small amount of saliva which might be released by swallowing/crushing the mosquito may irritate one's throat slightly. However, a more likely cause of   irritation is  : the anxiety caused by a threat to one's health can cause an enhanced state of sensory sensitivity. In other words, if someone is anxious that something might hurt them, they might feel something that they might not otherwise pay much attention to, making it worse.

If nutrition were as easy as Soylent claims, well, we could take a multivitamin and eat ice cream for the rest of our lives, no problem. But what do you know, it's more complicated than that. We're constantly discovering new nutrients or new roles for nutrients we already knew about. We now know from microbiome- and psychology- related research that we are not simply the sum of what we eat, but also why we eat and how we eat. You probably won't die from consuming Soylent (people eat more terrible things all the time), but I wouldn't consider it any healthier than, say, Wonderbread with a multivitamin chaser. In the end, I merely consider it another addition to our supermarkets full of highly processed food. And dude - it's made of people. Gross.	2015-06-19 23:28:18Z	Victoria Lam	1
1128	1324	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1324	The wisest thing ever said on television was in an old margarine commercial: "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature." Eating Soylent exclusively, or as a high percentage of food intake, is unwise, and the fact that some people seem to be getting away with it, unscathed, should offer little reassurance.  As others have remarked, we have no way of knowing if we know all the essential nutrients Mother Nature wants us to have.  And we may not ever know, because nutrient deficiencies can take years or decades to appear.  Vitamin B12 and vitamin E are examples of this.   I recall one lecturer talk about a vitamin or mineral deficiency that was discovered by medical science only because a woman had habitually eaten nothing but an egg on toast for 20 years (cannot remember what it was).  And then there are other deficiencies that have come to light much more recently, when hyperalimentation solutions lacked something that humans had never before suspected was essential (I'm thinking vanadium, but again am not sure). On top of this, I would additionally be concerned about the very naive medical reasoning that Soylent's inventor evinces.  On this page   he wonders if his family's fondness for tomatoes reflects a salutary  effect of lycopene peculiar to his family's genetics.  Nothing is impossible, of course, but the unstated assumption, which appears often in Soylent discussions, is that human appetite for specific substances is correlated with the body's need for, or benefit from, those specific substances.  Although true for calories (we get hungry when deprived of calories), in general it is balderdash -- go read about pica and cissa.  (You'll read, for example, about iron deficiency causing a massive craving for ice, which is, of course, iron-free.  Iron deficiency also causes craving for tomato seeds, which are poor in iron; maybe the inventor's family is iron deficient.)  And then you can go read about B12 deficiency (called pernicious anemia, because it was uniformly fatal).  Those people had aversions to meat, when, in fact, meat was the food richest in the nutrient they were missing. Life is an exceedingly complex and subtle machine, and it's risky to think that humans can re-engineer macro processes that are built into us at the deepest levels.  If you consume a lot of Soylent and get a disease unknown to medical science, I will be very happy, because we will have learned something about metabolism, and minimally sad, because it was a choice you didn't have to make.	2015-06-20 23:47:58Z	Iron Pillow	0
1126	1134	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1134	A proper diagnosis would require more questions for your particular situation.  For example:
 - Do you have, or have you had, a fever since you noticed this bump? 
 - Do you any other skin reactions anywhere else on your body? 
 - Did you have any scratches or broken surface of the skin in the area of the bump before you noticed it and the swelling started? 
 - Do you know of insects, ticks, or spiders that may be common in your area? If so, do you feel you may have been exposed to these? It appears one possibility is a localized reaction resulting from an insect bite. The symptoms you are noticing are common after an arthropod bite, such as local discomfort or pain; pruritis (itchiness); and erythema (redness). Because there is blanching in the center with a ring of erythema around this, it may suggest a bite. Another less likely possibility is cellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous layer of tissue just below the skin. This can result from trauma to the skin such as a cut or a bite, when bacteria are able to enter through the disturbed skin surface. However, accompanying symptoms also include tenderness/pain at the site; chills; fever; and swollen lymph nodes near the site. Ibuprofen (e.g. Motrin) taken orally should help decrease inflammation around the site of the swelling, thereby alleviating some of the itching and discomfort. The topical corticosteroids available over the counter may not be in the strength you need to counter an inflammatory or allergic reaction.  Due to this, it would be prudent to consult your health care provider if this does not start to resolve within the next 24 hours as it sometimes may two to three days for the initial symptoms to subside if this resulted from a bite. Also, if you develop other symptoms such as fever, nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue, or hives you should see your provider right away.

Assuming that your blood sugar would have remained level had you not eaten (which will not usually be the case in real life), you just need to subtract your   blood sugar from your   blood sugar.  Suppose your correction factor is 1:50, e.g. 1 unit brings you down 50 mg/dL.  You can then estimate about how many extra carbs were in the meal, using your insulin-to-carb ratio:  Suppose your ratio is 1:10, e.g. 1 unit covers 10g of carb:  If you use 15g carb = 1 exchange/choice:  So, you now know that the meal had 23g more carb in it than you expected, and that in the future you would take 2.3 more units.  Of course, in reality it's not quite so simple. Different foods take longer to digest, convert to glucose, and enter the bloodstream. Activity level, injection site, and other factors affect how quickly insulin kicks in.

In the specific case of rice, the standard serving size is "140 g prepared; 45 g dry" listed in the format "_ cup(s) (_ g)". Usually, the nutritional label on the actual product package (no comment on databases on random websites and apps) will provide information about whether it is referring to prepared or "raw" state, or will provide both. The prepared state may include ingredients not provided in the package. For example, Cheerios has a serving size of "1 cup (28 g)", dry, and additionally provides a column with values for "with 1/2 cup skim milk". Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Dinner gives the serving size as "2.5 oz (70 g / about 1/2 box) (Makes about 1 cup)", and provides columns for "as packaged" and "as prepared". Different pictures I found of the nutrition information and directions varied widely as to the calories of the "as prepared" column and the amount of butter called for; presumably these will match on any given box. I wasn't able to find any pictures of real nutrition labels for packages of plain rice. Google allows you to specify "raw" or "cooked" when searching for the nutrition information of rice - according to it, 100 grams of cooked long-grain brown rice has 111 calories, and 100 grams of raw long-grain brown rice has 370 calories. When the measure is switched to one cup, the calories are 216 and 684 respectively, with the weights being 195 and 185 grams. So, if your app doesn't say, it should be easy to figure out which numbers track better with how many calories it actually says a cup of rice has.	2015-06-02 20:40:19Z	Random832	4
1119	1121	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1121	There is no standard for calculating "food volumes". The nutrition data of all foods is only consistent by weight. Standardized nutrition data labels all give nutrients per 100 g, frequently also adding the nutrient amount calculated for other weights, for example for one unit of packaging, or one piece when the food is in discrete pieces.  When somebody is talking of nutrition units (e.g. calories, grams of carbs, or whatever) per volume, they are probably using some volume conversion formula. But for most foods, there is no really good formula. Food volume changes a lot in preparation, and frequently it's not as predictable as the change in rice volume you describe - if you have chopped walnuts, the final volume depends on how finely they are chopped, and also how they were handled afterwards. Also, volume measurement of foods is imprecise to the point where it's useless (for example, a "cup" of flour can be anywhere from 100 to 160 grams for the same type of flour).  The conclusions: 1) there is no way to predict what formula they are using (e.g. whether they are using the average for cooked or raw rice), because there is no standard for that, and 2) even if you happen to use their formula, you can't achieve precision. If you need precision, you'll have to switch to an app which lets you measure your food by weight. 	2015-06-02 15:16:47Z	rumtscho	3

If you want to set your biological clock 6 hours back, then it may take a week before you're fully adapted to the new routine. Make sure your bedroom is dark during sleeping time. After a few days into the new routine you should exercise, even if due to excessive sleepiness you don't feel like doing so. A potential problem a few days into the new routine can be that you have accumulated a sleep deficit due to not sleeping well a few days, but this will affect your brain far more than your body.

1099	1142	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1142	The simpler story is that it is better to eat whole fruit.  The problem with eating smoothies or even drinking fruit juice is that you are increasing the fruit's glycaemic index. For example, an orange has a glycaemic index of 40, while orange juice has a glycaemic index of 50 . The theory goes that low glycaemic index foods lower the risk of metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes and there is indeed epidemiological data which confirms this specifically about fruit and fruit juice:  based on data from 3 studies which followed a total of ~150 000 women and ~35 000 men for 18 to 24 years. . Note that the consumption of fruit juice increases the diabetes risk when compared to baseline, not just when compared to whole fruit.  Seeing that the average person in a Western culture has a higher chance of developing a metabolic disorder than of having difficulties digesting cellulose, we can conclude that, ceteris paribus, fruit is healthier for you than fruit juice. I did not find data on smoothies and purees, they should fall between whole fruit and fruit juice in glycaemic index.  The story gets murkier when we consider your diet as a whole. People are unlikely to eat a whole orange when they are thirsty. So if you are currently drinking orange juice and planning to switch to the same amount of whole oranges and switch to drinking water, this is probably going to be a healthy decision. But if you are going to switch to drinking Coca cola when thirsty, it will likely be worse. While I did not look for data doing this comparison, the glycaemic index of Coca cola is 63 , and it also contributes many calories without them being paired with micronutrients.  There has been some debate on whether recommending diets based on GI makes sense, see these two 2002 reviews (paywalled):   and  .

1099	1454	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1454	There is a simpler answer than others on this page. Drinking the calories associated with 4 oranges can be done in about 5 seconds.  This does not give your body's satiety mechanisms time to kick in and diminish your appetite if you are already tanked up on the calories you need for that day.

The only thing I will add to this, as a pharmacist, is keeping all your pills in a single container makes identifying them difficult/time consuming for a third party. If you were in a situation where you or a loved/trusted one was unable to list your medications, having them all together makes this situation much more difficult and potentially harmful to you.  
By law, all prescribed medication marketed and sold within the US are required to have a stamp on them for identification purposes (see:  ). If there are many different medications in a single container it is easier for a single pill to be missed in the sorting phase (as many pills are small, white, and round making them look incredibly similar). This could hurt you in the short and long run. Better to get a cheap pill box to separate them at least by what you take each day to cut down on some of this.	2016-01-01 14:38:38Z	kenorb	4

Regarding the available data, as usual a   provides the best meta-analysis, and as usual they conclude that there is insufficient evidence for anything.

Other medications that are sometimes used off-label include   (a.k.a. Reglan) and  . Although the studies of these medications are small, they do appear to be effective. Most often, hiccups are benign, often triggered by gastric distention from over-eating or carbonated beverages. However, particularly intractable hiccups have been associated with serious conditions including intracranial problems such as stroke or encephalitis as well as many different kinds of cancer. If hiccups are occurring very frequently or are difficult to resolve, you should consult with a doctor.

"Strapping" (or belting) hernias has been done in one form or another for centuries. It's fine for people who have relatively small hernias that are asymptomatic. However, it's not a cure. The separation of the abdominal wall muscle is permanent (it's caused by either an inherent weakness at birth, and/or repetitive stress). For inguinal hernias, watchful waiting (deferring surgery until it's necessary due to pain or other symptoms) is a perfectly acceptable way to "treat" hernias. Though there is considerable crossover to surgery, in one study, men have been watched for more than 11 years without any mortality and only 2 emergency repairs in a group of 254 men with inguinal hernias. The limitations are on lifting, activities, diet, constipation and other factors; many of the hernias become more painful with time.

For example, if your gastroenteritis was caused by a norovirus (formerly called Norwalk virus, the most common cause of food poisoning), a blood test for IgM (Immunoglobulin M) to the virus, indicating a recent illness, might be positive. However, diagnosing after the fact in a short term and self-limiting illness like norovirus infection is harder than diagnosis during the illness (which requires just a small stool sample), unless the pathogen is known with certainty, and even then, there may not be a residual response to test. Clearly, you will be paying for a large number of tests with only a chance that one of them will come up positive. In terms of getting a doctor's note, it's best if you a) have a prior relationship with the physician, b) call him while you're sick (not after) or c) see a health care provider, go to the school health clinic, a walk-in clinic, or something similar. Writing a note after the fact is a tricky area ethically. Many doctors who know and trust their patients will do it without hesitation. But I can understand others simply refusing the request for a post-illness work-up (which might be negative regardless) on the basis of cost and questionable need. Or to use a medical metaphor, an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.

Your sleepiness after a meal is caused by the   decrease of peptides in your brain called orexins (aka hypocretins). In 1998, two groups of researchers simultaneously discovered 2 small neuropeptide hormones that regulate, among other things, wakefulness and feeding behavior.  One group discovered them while searching for molecules that could bind to "orphan" receptors, that is, a brain receptor with an unknown "binding" molecule (called a ligand). They found that the prohormone   was found in a very small area of the hypothalamus which had been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis; this suggested the possibility that the neuropeptides might be involved in the regulation of food intake. When administered into free-feeding rats' brains, one of these peptides (orexin A/hypocretin 1) stimulated food consumption in a dose-dependent manner (with attention to light and dark periods, i.e. the circadian rhythm), with a lower dose increasing rat feeding about 2-fold, and the higher dose inducing a 3+-fold increase in feeding compared to rats injected with a solution without the peptide (the other stimulated feeding to a lesser degree). The effect persisted for 4 hours. Furthermore, fasting rats produced more than twice as much orexins as rats feeding freely. For this reason, the molecules were names "orexins", after the Greek word  , which means "appetite". They speculated that the orexin-secreting neurons might somehow be modulated by glucose. At the same time, another group of researchers using a completely different approach found that the same group of hypothalamic neurons were stimulated by a peptide hormone similar in composition to the gut hormone  . They identified the same prohormone and its two peptides, naming them   for "hypothalamus" and "secretin". They found that at least one of the peptides had a neuroexcitatory activity in specific areas of the brain (they mapped effects in the hypothalamic neurons, the posterior hypothalamus, the septal nuclei in the basal forebrain, the preoptic area, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the colliculi, the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract) suggesting that the peptides acted within the central nervous system as homeostatic regulators with a role in nutritional homeostasis. Scientists have not decided on whether to call them   or   yet, so both are used. They are found in all vertebrates. In 1999, a group of scientists found that narcolepsy (a sleep disorder characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness) was caused by a lack of a hypocretin/orexin receptor 2 gene in certain dogs, therefore establishing that they play a very important part in the regulation of wakefulness.* Since then, an enormous body of work has shown that orexins/hypocretins (O/H from here on in) are involved in the regulation of a wide range of behaviors, including wakefulness and vigilance (needed to find food), systems that regulate emotion and reward (including drug-seeking behavior when stressed and eating for pleasure - "consumption beyond homeostatic needs" - leading to obesity), and more.** Several studies report that the firing rates of O/H neurons are influenced by serum glucose, triglycerides and amino acids.  In English, and in your case: You are awake (O/H is being secreted by O/H neurons in your hypothalamus). You eat. Your serum glucose rises. The elevated glucose causes depolarization of inhibitory neurons   Result: wakefulness decreases. (You can barely make it to your bed, in your case!) The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved suvorexant (Belsomra) for the treatment of chronic insomnia. The (prescription only) drug is an   and is the first approved drug of this type. It blocks the effect of orexin in wakefulness (isn't science grand?) Unlike benzodiazepines and other hypnotics, rather than promoting sleep, suvorexant inactivates wakefulness, and rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were not observed when suvorexant was discontinued after 3 months or 12 months of   use. It does have risks and side effects, but so far its safety profile looks pretty good.

A more important problem with sleeping in a prone position is poor posture. Most people don't have a bed like a chiropractic table that allows them to breathe with their face straight down while maintaining a neutral spine. Due to this lack of beds designed for the prone sleeper they have to turn their head to the side. This extreme rotation held for 8 hours can cause neck pain. Most people who sleep that way also use a pillow under their head and/or upper body causing excessive and prolonged lumbar extension. This can lead to low back pain.  The textbooks and the research I've seen always say the best sleep position maintains a neutral spine. That means on your back with a pillow supporting your neck and one supporting your knees. Alternatively you can sleep on your side with a pillow supporting your neck, head, and the top arm as well as a pillow between the knees. This will keep the spine in a neutral position. I always tell my patients that the best way to sleep is the one that gives you a good, full nights sleep. You can probably improve your sleep with a few modifications, but if you are a side sleeper, you'll have a difficult time trying to force yourself to your back because, you're not conscious at the time. The Mayo Clinic has some excellent   that can help with modifications.  People tend to sleep in positions that are comfortable for them. If all day long they sit or work in a flexed posture then their body may crave the extension of their low back that comes from prone positions. In fact they may sleep prone because of back pain caused by excessive flexion. We've all seen this phenomenon before as we squirm in our chair or our legs ache to stretch when on a long flight or car ride. Motion and proper posture affects every aspect of our life.

The key factor here is known as gastric emptying, or how quickly the food is going through you.   , only the nutrients that are easy to absorb (like fats) are obtained.  Eating more food at once (to a point) slows gastric emptying allowing for more complete digestion. There are two key aspects when looking at the digestion of fruit.  The first, and perhaps obvious, benefit is the absorption of nutrients.  All of the calories, vitamins, etc that one can get out of fruit falls into this category.  The second benefit is that of fiber which can help clear the gut of waste, bowel motility, maintenance of gut flora, and other uses that call for both soluble and non-soluble fibers which fruits are rich in.

1058	1085	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1085	The simple answer is "metabolic lactic acidosis".  Actually, the Wiki articles doesn't quite say that (?). Prior food/drink would determine the glucose and glycogen - the stored form of glucose - available. Also, hydration is important. The   (12 volunteers) linked by Wikipedia concludes that  Normally, muscles using glucose as an energy source produce a 3-carbon molecule called pyruvic acid (or pyruvate). In the presence of oxygen, the pyruvate is further metabolized into CO , which is carried by the blood and exhaled from the lungs.  Exercising beyond a certain point causes muscles to burn glucose under anaerobic (no oxygen) conditions (the blood cannot deliver oxygen to the muscles quickly enough.) The result is that pyruvate is converted into lactate (lactic acid) instead of CO  which is released from the muscle cells into the bloodstream, where it accumulates over time. Since lactate is a relatively strong acid, it results in a decreased pH (an increase in free hydrogen ions, or H+) of the blood. This is called  . Normally, H+ in the blood is efficiently handled by a  ,  . The direction of the equation in the case of acidosis is driven to the left by the concentration of hydrogen ions. Normally, the CO  that is formed is simply exhaled by increasing the respiratory rate. This decreases the H* concentration and is called compensatory  . There is respiratory compensation whereby the body increases breathing to expel H+ in the form of CO2.  In the presence of excess H+, the body tries to compensate metabolically by increasing HCO -, which takes time. With continued exercise, the body cannot 'make' enough HCO - to handle all the H+, and the blood's pH falls. This is the situation which results in nausea and vomiting if serious enough.  	2015-05-28 16:42:59Z	anongoodnurse	5

However, I can tell you why the doctor wanted the following shots. Tetanus immunization: Any time a person gets a "dirty" wound* (animal bites and cat scratches are considered dirty - think of what a cat does with it's paws), tetanus immunization should be considered if the last immunization was more than 5 years ago (10 years if it's a clean wound.) Tetanus Immune Globulin: for dirty wounds in people with an unknown history of prior immunization, or if 2 or fewer doses in the past.  Often in the past, elderly individuals were unimmunized against tetanus because of the availability and scheduling of the immunization. The TIG is recommended because the tetanus toxoid - the "tetanus vaccine" - takes a while (and several doses) to induce immunity. The TIG provides immediate but temporary immunity by directly providing antitoxin.  Rabies/Rabies Immune Globulin - for any bite from an animal of unknown status. Nonbite exposures rarely cause rabies, however that does not mean  . Such exposures should be evaluated for possible postexposure prophylaxis administration.

It is impossible - literally* - to test every batch of ice cream, spinach, frozen hamburger, etc. that is shipped out to supermarkets for sale. The FDA relies on the good intentions of the manufacturer to follow its guidelines and results of evaluations. If they do not, they are held responsible for damages inflicted on the public, as well as punitive damages and fines. In the example of ice cream, the FDA has guidelines for the facilities that produce the product based on years of studies and experience. They include cleaning recommendations, temperatures at certain stages, the amount of time the product must spend at certain temperatures, etc. The facilities are inspected routinely, and when a product ends up contaminated, the FDA does a new inspection and reviews the previous inspections for evidence that previous recommendations were ignored, or might have prevented what occurred. In other words, it's a continuous process that relies on the manufacturer to keep in compliance with FDA guidelines. Facilities that don't comply face recalls, fines, and ultimately closure. The Blue Bell Ice Cream Listeria outbreak is a good case study in the process.

The natural lower limit to metabolism is death: if a person restricts calories too much, their metabolism drops lower and lower, until they develop various complications and then die. The natural upper limit to metabolism is, in my view, heat: a person's metabolism is only going to increase naturally to a certain point, based on their BMI, body composition, genetics, lifestyle, etc., and after that point the metabolism will not increase any more otherwise excessive heat would be generated (also leading to death.) A example of dysfunctional metabolism where people just burn more and more energy is the misuse of the now-unavailable drug mimicking "uncoupling protein" ( ). BUT this is an example where a drug was taken that dysregulated metabolism. Normally the body will not allow the metabolism to increase like that. What happens instead in the natural world is obesity. If you increase calories too much, past the point of metabolic increase, then extra calories are stored as fat and you become obese.	2017-07-19 16:00:40Z	veritessa	2

As a general statement, I'm not sure how much it can go down before it's a problem, which is what I think you are asking as your second question.  Starving to death might be seen as this taking the BMR close to zero (though I don't think you would get to zero before death). I think a good reference for this is Peter Emery's review article " ."  There may be more appropriate references when concerning elective reductions in caloric intake, but I suspect the results are   on a smaller scale. There are a few sections of the review that are worth quoting and discussing here: First the general trend and cause: In essence, when you first start to fast (the references , that the review sites are from 1-4 days in this section) the body looks to other sources of energy ( ).  That is not sustainable over time, and then the BMR begins to drop.  How it begins to drop is largely through the lost of lean tissue, with a focus on muscle mass, which is probably a good evolutionary choice over more important systems such as the brain: Again, the   is also worth a read, especially as it deals with otherwise healthy individuals and people "dieting" in the common sense of the word (but in no means the medical).  Again body composition and physical activity take a leading role here, but changes in efficiency are certainly noted if not understood.  A conclusion reached on efficiency calculation ( ) is also worth quoting: When in your life span you start on your low caloric diet can effect the outcome of the diet.  A commonly understood example is a shorter stature/smaller skeletal frame will develop under limited nutritional intake.  It's probably worth noting that on an evolutionary scale, having too many calories is an exceedingly new problem.  In other words, even if we wouldn't see it as preferential in the developed world today, it is probably an adaptive response to lose lean body mass or not develop additional skeletal structure (with goals of efficiency).

The uterus will be bigger, and there will be excess everything: excess heads, excess rumps, excess backbones (these are things that can actually be felt and located on manual examination). Late in the pregnancy, if both twins are head down (the usual and most common presentation), there will be two rumps up top. In my medical experience delivering babies (I've delivered a significant number), this is fairly unlikely  . For one thing, the waters would have had to have broken - at least one sac if they were dichorionic diamniotic twins, which is most common for non-identical twins (which they were).

They occur in singleton pregnancies about once in ~1500 births, and usually, the "misplaced" part is a hand or arm.  In Genesis, note that the hand alone came out, and since it usually retracts, this is possible. The tying of thread around the infant's arm might be enough noxious stimuli to cause it to retract. As I said, with twins there's less room, however Which would be the exact scenario described in Genesis.

1019	1051	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1051	Ingestion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), especially very high strength H2O2, can be very dangerous and can cause some serious health risks and possibly even death.  A United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcement made in 2006  says that drinking high strength H2O2, specifically H2O2 of 35%, is extremely dangerous and can cause several serious side effects. "Ingesting hydrogen peroxide can cause gastrointestinal irritation or ulceration." It can also cause other health risks, some of which can be life threatening.  Another article from 2007  talks about a specific incident in which a 39 year old man accidentally drank 250mL of 35% H2O2. Though the man did not experience the worst possible side effects, he did have to go to the hospital and he did experience damage in his stomach. This is a good example of a real life situation in which H2O2 was consumed, and it did not turn out well. Another real world example  turned out much sadder. A 2 year old girl swallowed two sips of 35% H2O2 and died. This happened because of a   (cell-killing) injury in the tissues and formation of oxygen gas ( ) caused by the H2O2. Ingestion of 35% H2O2 is undeniably dangerous, but what about lower concentrations of H2O2, such as 3%? A study from the 1990's  studied 670 cases of mostly children being exposed, usually orally, to 3% H2O2. "Exposure to hydrogen peroxide 3% is usually benign, however, severe gastric injury may occur following small ingestions in children." Overall, they found that a majority of the children were not affected by the low concentration H2O2, but there were special cases in which bad outcomes did occur.  Overall, we can see that safeness of drinking H2O2 varies depending on what the concentration is. High concentrations, 35%, are extremely dangerous and should never be consumed, but low concentrations, 3%, present low risks. Now, the question is do the benefits of 3% H2O2 outweigh the risks.  I have been unable to find any reliable sources showing that health benefits of drinking H2O2 of any concentration. Usually, it is used as a topical solution for minor cuts and wounds, not as something to be taken orally. Though the ingestion of 3% H2O2 hasn't been shown to be consistently dangerous, there have been cases of damage in the stomach and other parts of the body.  H2O2 poisoning can be very dangerous, even with low concentrations of it, so I would not recommend drinkin H2O2, ever.

As it turns out though these claims have a weak scientific basis, making the hypothesis for the hydrogen peroxide treatment    far-fetched. Let's look at the (implied) reasoning: 1) Cells make X to fight disease, so adding X would help fight disease better. 
There are 2 problems with this. Firstly, a higher concentration of X does not garantee more effectiveness--there may be side-effects to consider too. Secondly, cells may create it locally, whereas by ingesting it or injecting it into the bloodstream X may not reach the important area. 2)Oxygen kills pathogens, so adding oxygen to the cells will kill more pathogens. 
This claim is complete non-sense. Firstly there is the problem again that the oxygen increase is not local. Secondly this increase may be negligible compared to the normal oxygen levels in the cells. Lastly and most important, there is no proof that oxygen is lethal to cells capable of respiration. Some cancer cells may even depend on a respiration pathway to generate ATP. So  .

1014	1015	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1015	There is no need for any person to learn any drug taxonomy, unless this person is creating or extensively using clinical or pharmacological documentation. I don't doubt that somewhere, a single unified taxonomy of drugs exists, prescribed by some standardization body - and I also don't doubt that it's a major pain to use and as hated by physicians as ICD-10.  For all medical purposes outside of documentation, people use   the same way they do it for all other concepts in their life. They put a label on any group they (and hopefully their communication partner) readily recognize. And what they recognize depends on their level of expertise in the field.  This is why you, the patient, will naturally say "drugs for  " while talking to a friend of physician. A physician will use categories such as " ". Neither of you two studied a taxonomy tree of drugs before using a correct category name. You knew "there are migraines" and derived a proper category name from it. The physician learned about the role of serotonin in the brain, and one chapter of his textbook explained how serotonin is connected to migraine, and another explained how there are drugs which mimic the effects of serotonin by activating the same receptors which are usually activated by serotonin, so they can stop a migraine.  Note that the two categories are not the same, even though they have some overlap. Some serotonin receptor agonists are a type of migraine drugs. But there are migraine drugs which are not serotonin receptor agonists, and there are serotonin receptor agonists which do something other than heal migraine, because they activate a slightly different set of serotonin receptors. But there is no simple way to translate the category "serotonin receptor agonists" to layman's terms. It's not even a matter of it resulting from too detailed criteria, and saying that it's good for a layman to learn the more general category above it - because the more general category of "receptor agonist" is not easier to understand.    If what you want is a categorization system reflecting your current knowledge, then you already have it. Talking about "drugs for fever" or "drugs for migraine" is not wrong in any way. Just say whatever you mean when you need it. There could be a category which you need to talk about but cannot come up with a succinct name for it, such as "drugs for fever which are safe for toddlers and are taken through the mouth" - but it is unlikely that it already makes a node in somebody else's standardized taxonomy, you have to describe it. And while your doctor might be inclined to use the description "pediatric oral antipyretic" instead, this does not make your label less valid.  If you want to be able to work with a more intricate taxonomy, you'll need more medical knowledge. And that's great - everybody can use knowledge about such an important subject. But in this case, the knowledge comes first. Using the correct taxonomy will come naturally, as a byproduct of your increased knowledge. The other way round does not work.  Of course, it can happen that you come across information which refers to a category you don't understand, for example in the list of interactions of a drug you are taking. But if you want to understand this information, the way is not through some special taxonomy (which cannot be mapped to concepts you already know anyway). If you really need to know what makes a class of drug a "class" and not a random collection of drugs, and a source you find does not explain it in terms you understand, you need another source which will try to explain the criteria behind the existing expert's category.

There is a classification system of medicines that is quite detailed and widely used, and it is called: As you can guess from the name it classifies medicines based on:  How do they take all of these into account? By using a   classification system. The classification is paired with a code system, which can be used to search for a medicine on a regulatory agency's website, for instance. ATC classification system has five levels:   -   (this is a level a layperson can easily understand)  - therapeutic main group (this is a level that an informed patient can understand - if you are somewhat familiar with the medical condition/indication the medicine is for, you can understand this level)  - therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup (this is where things get quite technical; these waters are generally too deep for a layperson)  - chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup  -  the chemical substance How are medicines included in the system: from:  (if you are really interested in this subject, you might find some chapters of   interesting.   However, there is no need for you to learn this (or any other classification). If your goal is to gain knowledge on medicines the area you are interested in is   or more precisely  . This is quite a large area, but a real catch for a layperson is that it is an applied science, sou you would need knowledge from physiology, patophysiology and medicinal biochemistry first; and for those you would need cell biology, some anatomy and histology, microbiology, biochemistry (for which you definitely need some chemistry)... This would be a few year's quest and you would still need a curriculum and someone to supervise your learning process to make sure you understand all important concepts correctly.  This doesn't mean that you can't be a well informed, educated patient (or patient's caregiver, family member). You just don't need to learn about all of the major illnesses and medicines. Simply, when (if) a health problem occurs focus your efforts on that specific area. You cannot and should not use the knowledge you gain to self-medicate; it should serve you to communicate better with your health care providers, participate in the decisions, and if necessary consider if it's time to get a second opinion on something. An aside:   of how a book in pharmacology is organised. The lessons about specific medicines start from section 2. You can see that sometimes a cellular/chemical mechanism is used (section 2), and sometimes a whole organ or system of organs (section 3 and 4) or the disease to be treated (section 5 and chapters 43-45 in section 4 e.g.)  (whichever is better to explain how a certain medicine works). I do not recommend this book for you (not that it's not good, it's a great one) - because it's designed for grad students of medicine/pharmacy as well as phd students. While it is great because it encourages critical thinking, you can get lost in the quantity of details. I've just used its table of contents as an example how one can go about studying pharmacology. For a layperson I'd say that   with Wikipedia is not a bad thing (articles there are usually well organised), as long as you make sure to check the accuracy of information you find there. 	2015-06-28 14:41:20Z	Lucky	4

For example,   for the progression to diabetes is that the capacity of the body's usual fat depots is overtaxed, leading to having too much fat where it does not belong (e.g. intraabdominal fat deposits), resulting in lipotoxicity and finally diabetes.

The former involves modes of transportation such as walking and bicycling, where the commuter is actively getting exercise. The latter involves modes of transportation such as cars, buses, and trains, where the commuter is getting virtually no exercise. Many studies compare modes of transportation that fall into different categories; I chose to put them into one or the other based on which mode was focused on more. Other studies focused solely on one type of commuting. If you want to skip the specifics, you can go all the way to the bottom. Cardiovascular health from exercise and exposure to air pollution are the two main effects of commuting, although commuting may have minor effects on stress and mental health. Cyclists and walkers had much better cardiovascular health than non-active commuters in cars, buses, trains, and subways. This may lead to lower risks of obesity and diabetes. Exposure to air pollution varied. Commuters using the subways were exposed to different levels of different air particles than aboveground commuters. Commuters in some buses were exposed to high levels of air pollution; however, walkers and cyclists were exposed to high(er) levels in some cases.

Unless you are a psychyatrist, most medical professionals would find it very difficult to find out if an individual patient has a regular and normal sexual life, and even more difficult if they are as pleasurable as they should be.  Trying to find out may induce some patients to lie. Worse than that, some may say the doctor is too nosy and never return.   Even if an occasionally uninhibited and outspoken patient says that they have no sexual activity and think they would be much happier if they did, to advise "go and have sex to improve your general health or to help treat these disorders" can be risky.  If the patient makes wrong choices and unexpected problems are created, malpractice actions may follow.  All a doctor can do is mention that pleasurable sexual activity is good for one's health.

977	978	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/978	This is a very good question. The answer:  Your body has very specific mechanisms for maintaining a constant blood flow in the cerebral circulation despite shifts in blood pressure, either due to changing blood pressure in the rest of the circulation or due to a different 'local' pressure because of position . This is termed  . The blood pressure that the brain 'sees' is called 'cerebral perfusion pressure' (CPP). Technically CPP is the difference between intra-arterial pressure and the pressure in the veins, but venous pressure is very low (2-5 mm Hg), so we can estimate it as the arterial blood pressure (here, a weighted average of systolic and diastolic pressures). In a normal person accustomed to normal blood pressures, the body can maintain a constant blood flow of ~50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute with a CPP range of ~60 to 160 mmHg. That’s a big range! The mechanisms of autoregulation are incompletely understood. Most likely reductions in CPP stimulate the release of substances that cause vasodilation (candidates include H , K , O , adenosine), thereby increasing flow. On the other side, high pressures stimulate constriction of the myocites in cerebral vessels, reducing flow.  The end result is that your brain ‘sees’ a relatively constant pressure regardless of what position you’re in or other factors that may change blood pressure. That having been said, if blood pressure fluctuates outside the range for which auto regulation can accommodate, position does indeed matter for blood pressure. If a patient is markedly hypotensive, for instance, it is traditional to tilt the bed so that their head is below their body.  At the extremes, this manipulation can indeed affect blood flow to the brain.      	2015-05-15 12:39:02Z	Susan	8

The first thing a woman should do is see a physician to determine which kind of dysmenorrhea she has.   is painful menstruation with a normal pelvic examination (no causes can be determined). It is is by far the most common gynecologic problem in menstruating women, can be worse in younger women than older ones, and is worse in smokers. Usually women refer to this kind of pain as "menstrual cramps", and they tend to occur just before and in the early part of menstruation. The cause is increased production of endometrial  , natural hormones which cause uterine contractions. If the pain is severe enough, or in any way atypical, an pelvic ultrasound will be done to rule out pelvic pathology. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) are the usual treatment because they are anti-prostaglandins; NSAIDS include ibuprofen, naproxin, aspirin, etc. If NSAIDS alone do not decrease pain sufficiently, patients are often placed on oral contraceptive pills, which will make periods lighter and less painful, or continuous-use OCP's that result in suppression of menses altogether. If these are inadequate in the absence of pelvic pathology, stronger medications can be prescribed, or one can try accupuncture.

968	970	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/970	  The primary risk of excessive water intake is hyponatremia (low sodium level in the blood). While a healthy person who drinks 6-8 liters of water daily is unlikely to suffer significant hyponatremia, people who drink this much often have psychiatric illness that is accompanied by poorly understood hormonal changes that may indeed cause hyponatremia and its attendant symptoms.   Many patients with a variety of psychiatric disorders drink more water than normal. This is termed psychogenic polydipsia. The cause is unknown.     Sodium levels correlate closely with serum osmolality, since sodium is the primary cation contributing to osmotic pressure. The body maintains serum osmolality within a narrow range via regulation of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, a.k.a. arginine vasopressin), a hormone that is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland (a.k.a. neurohypophysis) at the base of the brain in response to a rise in serum osmolality. The hormone circulates in the blood and acts in the kidneys to increase free water resorption, thereby lowering serum osmolality. In the case of excess free water, ADH secretion will be maximally suppressed.  In a healthy person, ADH suppression results in urine diluted to a concentration of about 60 mmol/kg,  which (assuming a normal glomerular filtration rate) corresponds to a fluid intake of about 28 L per day. Only above that level with serum osmolality be significantly compromised.   Unfortunately, many people can not suppress ADH maximally. As a result, urine may be ‘inappropriately’ compromised in the face of falling serum osmolality. This is called, creatively, Syndrome of Inappropriate Diuretic Hormone (SIADH). For reasons that are incompletely understood, many psychiatric patients with psychogenic polydipsia (see below) have SIADH.  Some of the reasons that are understood:  The constellation of symptoms associated with hyponatremia is termed hyponatremic encephalopathy.  It includes: headache, blurred vision, weakness, muscle tremor and cramps, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, confusion. This can progress, in severe cases, to seizures, coma, and death. It would be exceedingly rare for a person with purely psychogenic polydipsia to progress to this point (in part because one is likely to develop depressed consciousness and stop drinking such that the kidney can fix the problem prior to dying).  One important point is that the level of hyponatremia required to cause these symptoms is largely dependent on the rapidity of change. Acute hyponatremia can cause symptoms at a level of 128-130 mEQ/L (normal 135-145 mEq/L). On the other hand, patients with chronic SIADH may walk around with sodium 120-125 mEq/L without symptoms.

957	1003	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1003	First of all, one has to distinguish between   (VA), which is a measure for the maximal possible resolution your eye-brain-system can achieve, and the  , which measures the deviation of the optical system of your eye from   (=perfectly balanced optics, sharp focus on retina without any glasses) in   of spheres and cylinders and thus determines what corrective glasses you need to wear in front of your eye in order to achieve your maximum possible visual acuity.  Visual acuity can be measured without corrective glasses, i.e. the "native" VA of your eye, or with your best corrective glasses, which then gives you the value of your "Best-corrected visual acuity" (BCVA), and only this value is useful for comparison purposes, e.g. for driver's licenses (because errors that   be corrected by glasses also   to be corrected by law, as this is rather easy to do for everybody), and also for scientific evaluation of eye performance. This also explains a common misconception: When somebody is very near- or farsighted (myope or hyperope), he has to wear glasses with a high (absolute) value of diopters, e.g. -7 dpt. But if he reaches 20/20 vision with his glasses on (again, BCVA), then to an eye doctor, this will matter the most; for the glasses are neglegible in comparison to "real" eye diseases which can impair your eye function and lower the BCVA your eye can reach. Many people incorrectly compare their eye functions by comparing the amount of diopters in their glasses, yet this doesn't really say anything about the maximum resolution their eyes have when wearing their best glasses. Refractive errors can be corrected by glasses, contact lenses and laser surgery, but the maximum visual acuity an eye-brain-system is able to achieve can   be altered in any (simple) way. Now, when visual acuity is measured, a   visual acuity, i.e. "normal", or 100%, or any way you'd like to name it, has once simply deliberately been determined by a minimum angle of resolution of 1 arc minute, and the charts that are used for testing it have letters that correspond with this resolution.   of resolution corresponds to being able to separate two points with 2,91 cm between them at a distance of 100 m. Now note that this does   necessarily correspond with what most people are able to see; as said previously, the definition of 100% visual acuity was deliberate.
The capability to distinguish points with 1 arc minute of space between them has been defined as 20/20 (or 6/6) vision in  , 1.0 vision in  , and later 0.0  , which is the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and which has become   (see p.13 for conversion chart), but is predominantly used for scientific purposes and less in clinical environments.

The systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the first number in a reading (Such as the 120 in 120/60), and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is the second number. The method for taking an arm blood pressure is to wrap the cuff around the upper arm, place the stethoscope over the brachial artery, and inflate the cuff until you cannot hear any sounds. Slowly bleed the air out of the cuff, and note the number when the first sound appears, and when the sound disappears to get your reading. The   was performed at a Mexican bodybuilding competition.

944	985	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/985	You picked an interesting virus (and illness) to ask about. There are still a lot of studies being conducted and many of the answers aren't in.  A bit of background. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV - the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis) is a member of the herpesvirus family, very "successful" viruses in that most of the world's population are infected (90% of the world's population has been infected with EBV), and the viruses are known to remain in the host's body throughout their lifetimes (that is, the host doesn't usually die from the disease, instead living to pass it on to others). With Herpes Simplex, reactivation is in the form of cold sores. With varicella-zoster virus - the cause of chickenpox - reactivation takes the form of "shingles". So, to expect EBV of periodic reactivation isn't very far fetched. In the US, ~50% of the population seroconverts (becomes infected as manifested by antibodies to the virus) before 5 years of age. This population has not been extensively studied for asymptomatic viral shedding. In the rest of the population, most cases of EBV infection are still subclinical, but some adolescents and young adults - about 25% of those newly infected - get the illness known as infectious mononucleosis (IM). This has been the group most studied group in terms of who is shedding virus and who isn't. Once infected, humans carry the virus for life in a small number of white blood cells called "memory B lymphocytes". Immediately following infection, the cells shedding the most virus are pharyngeal epithelial cells (though this has been challenged), so virus is present in the saliva, but has also been found in other bodily fluids. One study in France followed 30 patients for 6 months: 20 after diagnosis of IM, and 10 healthy EBV carriers (determined by the presence of IgG antibodies against EBV and the absence of IgM) as controls. Blood and  saliva samples were collected at day 0 [D0]), D3, D7, D15, D30, D60, D90, and D180 on all subjects. Infectivity of saliva was determined by lymphocyte transformation in cell cultures of fresh cord-blood lymphocytes. All newly infected patients had sustained viral shedding in the saliva, and all still had infectious saliva at day 180, 16 patients maintaining a   EBV load during the 6 months of follow-up, and 4 showing a   level of virus, though viral load was significantly lower at D180 than at D90 in all patients. Of the   (healthy people who had positive antibodies), 8 subjects had 2–4 episodes of detectable EBV in their saliva, with the remaining 2 having no EBV in their saliva during the follow-up period.  In the patient blood samples, EBV-infected B cells decreased significantly from day 0 to day 180, with 18 showing a viral rebound between D30 and D90. Among these 18, 4 patients had tonsillitis and lymphadenopathy (!) which indicates a recurrence. Only one of the control subjects showed no detectable  EBV in their Memory B Cells during the entire follow-up period. This shows that patients with IM remain highly infectious during convalescence. A Japanese study analyzed the prevalence of EBV in saliva and throat washings from healthy people. EBV DNA was detected in 43 of 48 throat washings from healthy adults aged 21 to 57 years of age, and in 35 of 93 salivas from healthy children 0 to 6 years old. Umbilical cord lymphocytes were transformed by some throat washings from EBV seropositive donors, indicating infectivity of the virus. Furthermore, EBV DNA was detected in throat washings from 2 healthy adults whose  .  In a study of 22 healthy EBV-seropositive blood donors over a period of 15 months, serology suggested reactivation (significant changes in viral load plus a serological response) in eight donors. Another five individuals also exhibited significant changes in viral load but no serologic response. Of the 13 volunteers with significant increases in viral load, 6 had a period of viremia accompanying the rise in viral load, that is,    What triggers reactivation in healthy subjects is not known precisely. The presumption is that it occurs when latently infected B cells respond to unrelated infections, because B-cell receptor stimulation triggers reactivation in B-cell lines.  So, whatever you have read, there is probably proof for it, as well as much else that wasn't read! It appears that healthy adults and children shed virus intermittently for an unknown number of years.

Then some people brushed twice daily with either an oscillating powered toothbrush, a manual toothbrush, and a manual toothbrush and flood together. The powered toothbrush was able to keep the levels of plaque lower than the other two groups and also help prevent gingival bleeding. Another 2010 study  also found very similar results in which the oscillating toothbrush help reduce plaque and prevent gum bleeding. From these studies and many others, we can see that oscillating toothbrushes are better for your teeth than manual toothbrushes. There is another type of electric toothbrush, sonic toothbrushes. They work by vibrating the brush head at sonic speeds. Though there are more studies done on oscillating toothbrushes, there have been a few done on the effectiveness of sonic toothbrushes. This 2015 study  found that sonic toothbrushes were significantly better at reducing plaque than manual toothbrushes. An earlier study published in 2014  also found that sonic toothbrushes were more effective at plaque removal. They also found that for a short time (1 week), the sonic toothbrushes were better at reducing the risk of gingival inflammation. After 3 weeks though, the amount of papillary bleeding (bleeding in some parts of the mouth) were the same between those who used sonic toothbrushes and manual toothbrushes. Overall though, it seems that sonic toothbrushes are also better for your oral health than manual toothbrushes. So we can see that both main types of electric toothbrushes are better than manual toothbrushes. But which is better, sonic toothbrushes or oscillating toothbrushes? In fact, a handful of studies has been done on this topic. A 2013 study  tested the two types of powered toothbrushes. Both the sonic and the oscillating toothbrushes were able to significantly reduce plaque and risk of gingivitis, but the results showed the oscillating toothbrush performed better than the sonic toothbrush. Three 2014 studies  agree with the conclusion that oscillating toothbrushes are better at reducing plaque and gingival bleeding than sonic toothbrushes. All of those studies were performed very similarly and had some of the same researchers between them. From these results, we can see that oscillating toothbrushes are superior to sonic toothbrushes. For both electric toothbrushes, we can see that risk of gingivitis and the amount of plaque on the teeth are reduced. You did ask more thing which I will answer more directly. Well, from the trials I've mentioned, we can see that this is most likely the case. The longest trial I directly mentioned  was 9 months long and it showed that 9 months of consistently using an electric toothbrush did help reduce plaque and gingival bleeding. Manual toothbrush can keep your teeth clean, but it takes more work than an electric toothbrush. Well, there are a few things that come into play . Even though electric toothbrushes are more effective at cleaning teeth and they don't take as much work as manual toothbrush, some people aren't willing to pay so much for a toothbrush. Some of the cheapest electric toothbrushes cost only $5, but the higher quality ones can go for over $100. You can get a five pack of manual toothbrushes for under $5. Another con of electric toothbrushes is that they are a hassle. They are bigger, and they require batteries or they have to be charged. Some people just don't want to deal with that. Lastly, electric toothbrushes can be easily broken. If you drop it, that might be it and you just lost $10. Now, electric toothbrushes are becoming more popular, but some of these cons are still holding people back.	2015-05-14 01:13:33Z	michaelpri	13
925	928	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/928	There are certain types of malocclusion that are have been shown to adversely affect quality of oral health and quality of life, but these are far, far fewer than the number of people sporting braces, adult or adolescent. The need for braces in the average teen, therefore, is no greater than the average adult. If you think of braces for teens as a necessity, it is no less a necessity for adults, that is, appearance is probably the only significant result for both average teens and adults. However, increased longevity has led to the need to keep healthy teeth for longer periods. Teeth continue to shift throughout life. Missing teeth (today's older adults are more likely to have had dental extractions than younger adults) allow teeth to shift, resulting in malocclusion. Malocclusion in turn can result in frequent inadvertent oral mucosal injuries. This can be corrected with braces. Missing teeth also mean less occlusive surfaces (chewing surface area). Believe it or not, this poses a choking hazard, as well as decreases a person's ability to enjoy certain foods. Braces or other orthodontic devices may be needed to shift teeth into proper position for bridges to restore occlusive surfaces. Since people are living longer, it makes sense to invest in procedures that will help you to continue to eat well. Recent reviews of dental literature, however, are showing that the oral health benefits of orthodontic intervention in adults are more limited. Malocclusion seems not to have a role in susceptibility to dental caries (as was previously believed), periodontal disease, and temporomandibular joint disorder. Therefor the oral health benefits of orthodontic intervention are more limited than previously believed. Finally, there is some evidence that adult orthodontics can result in harm in the form of root shortening, which can lead to loose teeth.

922	923	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/923	Yes, I understand you. I have been fighting a depression myself for the past months, although it must have gone on longer than that, undiagnosed. I know how it feels, and understand how you just want it gone away.  The direct answer to your question is: Selective memory loss is impossible. There is no way to forget that past year. But there is a way to get over the depression without forgetting.  The insidious thing about depression is that it makes everything seem like an insurmountable problem, and makes you feel incapable of solving it. So of course, you want the problems gone away. But the way forward is not to change the events which happened, or erase your memory of them. It is to learn that they are not really as bad as they feel, even when your depressed mind is convinced that they are terrible.  I know it might seem impossible to you to do so - after all, you are feeling in your bones that they are bad things. But clinical practice, and my own experience, shows that it is very possible. "Seeing the world with different eyes" is a skill which can be learned, just like you can learn to knit socks or play the piano. And there are many things you can do to learn it - reading books, talking to a specialist (therapist), observing and imitating those who have it, talking with others who are going through the same process, practicing your new skill, and having support from non-affected friends and family members who cheer your success without putting you into a pressure trap.  One of the tricky things about depression is that it saps our motivation to do anything, even the things which will heal us. It is very logical: why do something that is hopeless? The important thing here is to recognize that this hopelessness is not real, it is an illusion created by the illness. It's hard to get over it, because it feels absolutely real, but it is possible. If your ability to motivate yourself is so far down you cannot start with something as hard as cognitive therapy, you could start a medication course (st john's worth for milder cases, if you don't take any other medications, or go straight for synthetic antidepressants), which will give you the initial "spark" which will give you the energy to pack your problems at the root.  You will need a long time until you start feeling normal again, but believe me, it does work, even it is a hard, two-steps-forward-one-backward road. And even when the goal is still far away, the gradual progress is better than staying in place.  The result of it will be that you won't have forgotten what happened to you that last year. But the memories will just be memories, which will not make you feel like an anxious, hopeless failure, the way they do now. Right now, you experience them like a barrier blocking your way forwards in life, and want them gone. When you learn to manage the depression, they will be more like a chalk line on your way - you can step over it without it holding you back in any way.  Many of the resources you need have to be found locally, but I can suggest a few books. I have read tons of them in my own healing process, but these are the ones I found most helpful.  Good luck with your journey. And don't forget: you don't have to be special, or a super hero, to get over your own depression. All you need is the knowledge how to do it (I listed the sources above) and the tenacity to not give up when it feels hopeless. 	2015-05-10 11:08:17Z	michaelpri	14

I would imagine that when those indigenous peoples were introduced to sunglasses, they were also introduced to a number of other items they had never previously known, such as tobacco, alcohol and fast food. Diseases they had no immunity to might also have played a role.  The synthesis of vitamin D is well understood and sources describing it can be found in many places so I'm not going to quote the entire process, but a good explanation can be found  . In short, it's a passive process that occurs in the skin and is not regulated by the brain, eyes, or other organs. What determines the amount of vitamin D synthesized by the body? Solely the amount of UVB photons penetrating the skin and the person's age: There are no other factors mentioned in synthesis, and as you can see from the diagram   there is no involvement of the eyes or brain in vitamin D physiology at any point. Could there be an indirect involvement of the brain since it also controls the parathyroid glands? Yes, there could, but that wouldn't change the results of how we measure vitamin D levels. Therefore, an assertion that the eyes are involved in vitamin D deficiencies is purely speculative and the burden of providing evidence for it would be on the person making the assertion. I can find no evidence to support the notion. It's also a little odd considering that a huge number of people living in developed countries have been wearing sunglasses for many decades without ill effect. Why would we have not seen this effect long ago? Is it possible these indigenous peoples have unique genetic differences that altered their basic mammalian vitamin D physiology and somehow caused their eyes to be involved? Well, anything's possible, but that would be an   finding and it also is purely speculative.	2015-06-19 21:53:49Z	Carey Gregory	8
918	942	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/942	I can't speak for Old Spice, but Lynx/Axe is basically just a solution of perfume in ethanol. The ethanol kills the skin bacteria that generate the malodour (though the population quickly recovers!) and the perfume just makes you smell nice. Pure/concentrated ethanol will destroy cell membranes, which is how it kills skin bacteria, so it's more dangerous than its widespread use in drinks would suggest (though fortunately diluting ethanol with water greatly reduces the damage to cell membranes). The solvent in Axe is about 95% ethanol and this is concentrated enough to cause damage. There isn't very much ethanol in a typical few seconds of spray, but I suppose if you pointed the can up your nose and inhaled as you sprayed you might cause some real damage. I suspect the intense pain it causes would mean most people will do this only once! But I would guess the most dangerous ingredient in the deodorant is the perfume. Perfumes are an unholy mixture of terpenes, alcohols, ketones and lots of other stuff, and many of these chemicals are irritating to skin. Handling flasks of pure perfume is done in a fume cupboard with gloves and protective eye wear. Getting any large amount of perfume onto a mucous membrane like the eyes, throat or lungs would cause irritation and pain. But again, the amount of perfume in a few seconds of spray is small and you'd have to work at it to do yourself any serious harm. I suspect the warnings not to breathe the spray are largely just being cautious and/or a way of being protected from being sued. Though in principle the contents of the spray can cause harm this would take exceptional circumstances, and even then the result is likely to be local irritation rather than any serious damage. To my considerable surprise I have found a   (note that this is a 55KB PDF). The sheet gives the formulation though it omits the perfume concentration.

My personal experience is that I have a few lesions that my various dentists over the last couple of decades have decided not to fill because they are not serious and not getting any worse. So a dentist will not necessarily reach for their drill at every opportunity. My research experience is that at least   enamel can remineralise, but you are talking about incremental improvements and nothing approaching total repair of a cavity. Any major cavity will not repair itself. It is impossible for you to assess the damage to your teeth because you have neither the skills nor the equipment required. Your dentist has both, and you should respect their judgement. Your dentist should probably not have been impatient with your questions, but bear in mind that by questioning him you are implying he does not know what he is talking about and even the most saintly of dentists will get fed up with this eventually.	2015-05-12 11:13:12Z	John Rennie	6

912	916	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/916	While trying to measure the blood pressure, the physician is most likely interested in measuring the pressure inside the left ventricle of the heart. So it is necessary that the Sphygmomanometer and the cuff should remain at the level of the heart. If it is above the level of heart, the reading is likely to be low, and if it is below the heart, the reading is likely to be high. Also, the blood pressure varies with the posture of the body in which the measurement is taken. So the blood pressure value that exists in most guidelines (for example JNC 8) is measured in the sitting position. Hence the value we are intenting to measure is the one with the patient is sitting position, back supported, legs uncrossed, and upper arm bared. The diastolic pressure is high in sitting position, and systolic pressure is high in supine position. Not supporting the back will increase diastolic pressure, while sitting cross legged increases systolic pressure. This is due to the inherent mechanisms in the human body to maintain perfusions to certain organs. The detailed biomechanics is beyond the scope of the present discussion though.

There are three precursors (Dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA, A'dione, and A'diol) that are hormones used in endogenous (within the body, i.e. natural) testosterone production. Many of the supplements on the market that claim to boost testosterone do increase the amount of these three hormones, but in most cases, do not lead to concurrent elevations in testosterone. (There is a  ). As far as the side effects, it's best summarized by the same review paper that produced the above chart: In addition to the above, there is no regulation on the supplement industry, so they may contain wildly varying levels of ingredients (Even in the same brand/line), and there have been reports of heavy metal contamination as well as contamination with actual steroid substances. Currently, you can really sum up the supplement industry in this way: If it works, it's illegal and should be only used under a doctor's care. If it is safe to use, it probably doesn't work like they claim. Also, while many people do not realize it, if you participate in 5k fun runs, amateur cycling, or any amateur competition where the governing body adheres to USADA (or the local national equivalent) strictures, you can be subject to testing, no matter your competitive level.

901	904	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/904	Although it would be helpful if we knew what sort of pathology report this was, I surmise that it is likely describing analysis of a biopsy or surgically removed tissue specimen from a breast cancer. In breast cancer,   that some but not all tumors express hormone receptors, particularly estrogen and progesterone. Although the mechanism is complicated, the basic idea is that estrogen can bind to the cells in the tumor and make it grow faster. For this reason, people with tumors expressing the estrogen receptor are often treated with   that blocks that hormonal stimulation. In pre-menopausal women, this is usually   or a related drug, which blocks the receptors directly. In post-menopausal women, a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors ( , letrozole, etc.) that block estrogen production are used. The important piece to note is that only tumors that express estrogen receptors respond to this type of hormonal treatment. Partly because of the availability of these hormonal treatments, and perhaps partly due to the biology of the tumors themselves, breast cancer that expresses estrogen receptors     can refer to a variety of outcomes; in cancer studies it’s usually either survival or cancer-free survival. Patients with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer   than those with estrogen-receptor negative tumors. Another way of stating that is:  The pathology report (if I’ve got the context correct!) is saying that most (80%) of the cells in the specimen expressed the estrogen receptor. It then comments that this is known to be a favorable finding.	2015-05-07 23:49:43Z	Susan	7
895	917	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/917	Blood pressure of a person varies throughout the day. This is attributed to numerous factors including stimuli from your sorroundings. As an innate tendency of the body. blood pressure is lower at night when you sleep, and is higher when you wake up in the morning. It continuously increases(roughly) as the day progresses.  So there is no one best time to measure your blood pressure. If what you are looking to do is to monitor your blood pressure, then it is important that you measure it at the same time everyday - at whatever time of the day it is. If what you are trying to get is an accurate measurement, then you are better of measuring it at two different times of the day(in the morning and in the evening) and taking an average, or measure it at two different times and report the readings along with the time of the day the measurement was taken. If you are on any medication to control your blood pressure, then you should measure your blood pressure once in the morning before taking any medications and once in the evening (assuming that you take medication in the morning). However, your doctor may specifically ask you to measure your blood pressure at a particular time of the day. That is because he is interested in that particular value for some reason.

894	947	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/947	There seems to be some misunderstanding here, so this is going to be a long answer.  Our body is very, very good at regulating several physical and chemical parameters inside itself  . he most well known is the temperature: it does not matter if the air temperature is -50 Celsius or +50 Celsius, it will do its best to keep you between 36.5 and 37 Celsius, and will mostly succeed at that, with amazing precision, unless you get exposed for a long time to temperatures which are either too hot or too cold for its capabilities to adapt.   The system for regulating blood sugar is similarly complicated. The body is actively trying to keep the blood sugar at a level which it "believes" is best for it, and unless its regulation mechanism is badly broken, it's succeeding at that, at least in the long term. Short term upward spikes and downward spikes do happen in the healthy human, if you are either eating or using up sugar at a rate too quick for the body to compensate.  There is a theory that eating too much glucose and other simple sugars can break this regulation system. The reason: they cause upward spikes when they are eaten, because they can be transformed into blood sugar very quickly, quicker than the body can stabilize the level of blood sugar. The body then goes into "alarm! too high blood sugar!" mode, and mobilizes whatever it can to reduce the blood sugar before it causes problems. That overreaction gets the spike down soon, but the high hormone levels stay, such that you now get a downward spike in blood sugar.  The supporters of the "this is unhealthy" side of the debate (note that the matter is not yet settled in the scientific community, although I'm under the impression that it has been gaining ground lately) say that first, this creates hunger pangs (because when your blood sugar falls, one of the body's mechanisms to get it back up is to create the feeling of hunger, so you supply it with more food) and leads to overeating, and second, frequently straining the blood sugar regulation system will make it less effective over time, because it's overworked, and also because the body gets less sensitive to its signals. This leads to metabolic syndrome and later, diabetes type 2, such that the body can no longer keep the blood sugar at the level it wants it to be.  The gist of it is:  .  Now you can say that your friend seems to need her blood sugar raised, so for her, eating a food which raises it is not unhealthy. This is indeed logical, but in that case, then sugar is not unhealthy for her either. If she wants to try to raise her blood sugar with food, then pure glucose is indeed the best she can do, followed closely by table sugar.  That being said, if I were her, I would   try messing with my blood sugar levels through food. Her sugar regulating system is either working well, or malfunctioning. If it is working well, then there is nothing she should be doing about it, despite it not fitting some norm.   (which is unlikely to help for timeframes over several minutes to an hour anyway). If she mistrusts her general physician's competence in that matter, she should visit an endocrinologist. If she has no symptoms from the low blood sugar and trusts him that there is no cause to worry, she should keep everything as it is, instead of trying to override her hormones by gorging on glucose, or any other food which raises the blood sugar level. 	2015-05-12 17:57:33Z	rumtscho	4

886	888	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/888	According to  , no daily reference value has been established for sugars because no recommendations have been made for the total amount of sugar to eat in a day.  Keep in mind that the sugar values listed do not distinguish between naturally occurring and added sugars, because it is not a chemically meaningful distinction. So unlike nutritional information about vitamins, proteins, fats, etc, there really is no level of "recommended sugar" that would make a good blanket statement for everyone.  Claims that high consumption of added sugars harmful to your health is an extremely complicated subject. It's not that the sugar itself is inherently harmful due to any of its chemical properties; it's just that added sugar tends to be in products that have extremely high fat and high calorie content, and are easy to consume in large quantities. So saying to avoid foods high in added sugars is good general advice.

University of Maryland Medical Center notes that this unique food is rich in B-complex vitamins, zinc, vitamin E, beta-carotene, copper, selenium, iron and essential fatty acids. In addition, spirulina is about 62 percent protein by weight. Spirulina is safe to use, but the recommended dosage must not be exceeded. Spirulina can provoke more than a few light side-effects, by virtue of the fact that it detoxifies the body. It is thus recommended to start with weak doses, which are gradually increased. Spirulina can provoke migraines or light fever; for some, it can cause constipation, for others diarrhea (particularly in strong doses). It can cause the appearance of red spots, bring light stomach pains, provoke black or green stools (because it detoxifies the colon). Spirulina can also cause a temporary weakening of the liver (by virtue of the fact that it contains many vitamins and minerals), as well as kidney problems in very strong doses (over 10 grams per day). It must be remembered that all these side-effects are the result of detoxification and purification. Reduce dosage and then increase gradually again.

As a result, it does not foam.  The bacteria in your intestine presumably continue to produce gas, but it quickly passes to its now-slippery contents, instead of being trapped and expanding them like the head of a poured beer.

Of course one could use brushing and mouth rinse alternatively since they are equally effective preventing caries. I think one should use either one and not to alternate since usually the more complex routines one developed, more likely they fail. As so, I think we should look at whether mouth rinses provide any additional benefit to brushing. Three most common active ingredients in mouth rinses are some form of alcohol, chlorhexidine and fluoride ( ). The longer-term effects of any treatment should always be evaluated, especially in this case since the use is projected to last possible of life-time. Chlorhexidine containing mouth rinses may cause staining and affect oral flora. The are no specific guidelines how long to use chlorhexidine containing mouth rinses  but one sources discourages using it more than 3-4 weeks ( , ).  There are some health concerns also regarding the alcohol containing mouth rinses. Currently it is controversial whether alcohol containing mouth rinses predispose to cancer ( , , ).

Additionally, these are the effects of using corticosteroids on a much more frequent basis than you would be having them - and even then, these effects are only possibilities. These studies are the closest approximations I can combine to address your specific case. It seems that three-month intervals are the longest period of time that has been studied in any depth. In other words, your regimen seems to be a rare one - and a safer one. Every cortisone shot has the potential for side effects. But the combined effect of these multiple shots would most likely be have been diluted substantially.

851	869	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/869	To be precise, one needs to know what "normal" means.  is actually a function of two measurements (for example, hemoglobin level and number of people sampled with said hemoglobin level). This generates a bell-shaped curve.  The graph of the normal distribution gives us both the mean and standard deviations from the mean. If the standard deviation is large, the curve is shorter and wider. If the standard deviation is small, the curve is taller and narrower.  For example, if one measured 500 American males at 30 years of age who were 5'10 inches tall, your curve would look something like this: where zero (the mean) might be 177 pounds. Including one standard deviation above and below the mean would represent ~68% of the population. Some will be thin, some will be heavy; they will fall outside this 68%. If the same measurements were taken in Africa, for instance, where there is a difference in diet and body habitus, then the mean might be 134 pounds.  So, yes, it is possible to have different "normals" for different countries. However, that does not mean the same thing as "healthy" or "optimum". By and large, human beings are human beings, and what is regarded as healthy for an average person in Europe should be the same for an average person in India.  There are exceptions, for example, sherpas in Nepal have a lower number of red blood cells compared to lowlanders who must accommodate themselves to lower oxygen in the highlands by making more red blood cells. This is a result of selection for a gene that regulates red blood cell production in the low oxygen of the highlands, with other compensatory mechanisms.	2015-05-04 20:06:20Z	anongoodnurse	2
840	3306	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3306	Blood pressure is often checked in lower limbs also. BP needs to be checked in all limbs if one is suspecting obstruction in the arteries. Takayasu's arteritis and atherosclerosis are 2 conditions that can result in unequal blood pressure in different limbs due to obstruction of arteries.  In ankle-brachial index test, blood pressure is checked in the arm and at ankle to detect peripheral arterial disease (PAD:   ) Also, if coarctation of aorta (congenital narrowing of great artery in thorax) is supected, pressure in lower limbs will be lower than that in upper limbs. Aortic regurgitation (incompetence of aortic valve) leads to higher pressure in lower limb than in upper limb due to pressure wave reflection. Here also it is recommended that pressure is recorded in both upper and lower limb. The degree of change in lower limb correlates with severity of regurgitation (Hill's sign). Initially, blood pressure should be recorded in both upper limbs. If BP difference in 2 arms is more than 15 mm Hg (systolic), tests (e.g. Doppler ultrasound) should be done to rule out obstruction. For following up on treatment of high blood pressure in such cases, higher blood pressure should be taken and controlled with medication.  Blood pressure can also be estimated using finger probes, but their accuracy and reliability is not well established. This will also be subject to diseases of arteries in the arm, forearm and hand.  For checking blood pressure, one needs an area where the artery can be compressed and one needs to listen to the artery distal to this area as the pressure is released. Brachial artery lies in front part of elbow and can be heard over easily. On the other hand, the artery in knee lies posteriorly (behind the knee).  Since arteries to upper limbs come out of aorta much earlier than arteries to lower limbs, the pressure in upper limbs would be much less subject to diseases of aorta or compression on it by masses in thorax or abdomen. This would be main reason to prefer arms over legs, in addition to simple convenience factor. 	2015-10-02 11:09:20Z	rncardio	3
840	3305	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/3305	The reason we use the upper arm is that the arteries at that level have the same pressure of blood as the outflow-tract from the left ventricle (i.e. where the blood leaves your heart). Because of the weight of the blood, your pressure in the main arteries in your leg is slightly higher and in your head is slightly lower. This effect is more pronounced when sitting upright or standing. I think that we also measure it there for practicality - for serial measurements to make sense we should measure it in the same place every time, and an arm is much more easy to get to than a thigh (you'd have to take your trousers off every time!). Measuring pressures at the end of limbs is only useful in very specific conditions (such as peripheral vascular disease).	2015-10-02 09:54:21Z	jetbackwards	0
839	1560	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1560	I would like to add a brief answer in common language. The heart is a pump which pushes blood into the arteries in pulsatile manner (pushes out blood with each heart beat). As the blood is pushed in the arteries, the pressure rises to a peak called systolic pressure, which is usually around 120 mm Hg. As the heart's main chamber (left ventricle) relaxes, the pressure tends to fall. But fall in pressure is arrested by closure of a valve called aortic valve. Further fall in pressure occurs by flow of blood to peripheral tissues.  The lowest limit to which the pressure falls in main arteries is called diastolic pressure and it is usually around 80 mm Hg.  Morever, when the blood pressure is checked with a mercury instrument, the cuff around arm is inflated to about 200 mm Hg (to occlude the flow in artery of the arm) and then slowly pressure is reduced while listening to the sounds over artery in front of the elbow joint. Knocking sounds start coming at systolic pressure (usually around 120 mm Hg). These sounds disappear as the cuff pressure is lowered below diastolic blood pressure (usually around 80 mm Hg). Hence, the BP reading is said to be 120/80. The following figure from the   should make this clearer. The notch on the downnstroke indicates point of closure of the aortic valve.   Edit in response to comment below: The mechanism of these sounds is not entirely clear and has been subject of study since long (see this 1929 article:   . Many theories have been proposed e.g.   . It is likely to originate from the artery wall due to vibrations created by turbulent flow that occurs when blood flow is partially obstructed (ref:  ). There is no sound when the flow is totally obstructed i.e. cuff pressure greater than systolic pressure. Also, there is no sound when cuff pressure is lower than diastolic since the flow then is laminar and not turbulent. The nature of sounds (called Korotkoff sounds) also varies as pressure is lowered from systolic to diastolic and 5 phases have been identified:  References:	2015-07-14 12:05:14Z	rnso	11

Physicians are alarmed when they see systolic blood pressure (SBP) is equal to or greater than 180 mm Hg, or where diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is equal to or greater than 120 mm Hg; HBP with any signs or symptoms (especially stroke symptoms, confusion, hallucinations, etc.) is an emergency. Patients should be alarmed long  before physicians are - in other words, get treated before it becomes dangerous!  The Eighth Joint National Committee on Hypertension (JNC 8) analyzed large studies of hypertension from 1966 through 2009 - with some consideration of studies up to 2013 - and made recommendations for adults age 18 and older with hypertension. The outcomes considered in making these recommendations, i.e. what will happen if one fails to lower blood pressure (BP) were, among others: They rated their recommendations on strength of evidence. Grades were assigned.   : Strong - based on substantial (good) evidence (strongly recommended) 
 : Moderate - the net benefit is moderate to substantial 
 : Weak - moderate certainty that there is a small net benefit 
 : Against -no net benefit or that risks/harms outweigh benefits. 
 : Expert Opinion  -   evidence but the committee recommends (no great studies available) - further research recommended 
 : No Recommendation for or against - insufficient/unclear/conflicting evidence; further research is recommended in this area. : aged 60 years or older, treat to lower BP if systolic blood pressure (SBP) is equal to or greater than 150 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is equal to or greater than 90 mm Hg. Goal: SBP < 150 mm Hg; DBP < 90 mm Hg. (  for individuals 60 years or older who do not have diabetes or chronic kidney disease) : ages 30 through 59 years, treat DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher; goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.  : patients < 60 years with hypertension (HTN): treat; goal: BP < 140/90 mm Hg.  : ages 18 through 29 years, treat DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher; goal DBP < 90 mm Hg. In patients with SBP between 130-150 mm Hg, there was no increase in risk in adverse effects. LOW BP: There are no JNC8 recommendations; the decision to treat is based on expert opinion only. Goal: decrease  ; treat underlying cause (if any) (I.e.: if you're active, have no problems, but your BP is 80/60 - well... that's great! No adverse outcome is known.

The answer is that in reference 1, which used real-world measures of cold severity and duration, the drug was a total failure. You can see this by looking on the results tab at the "95% confidence interval." This is intended to represent a range of plausible values for the true effect of the drug, extrapolating from the sample of people that was studied (it gives a range of values because you can never know the exact value -- due to random chance, the people who were included in a study won't perfectly represent the entire population of people who might use the drug). By scientific convention, if the 95% confidence interval includes zero, the evidence isn't strong enough to say that the drug has an effect.  The study looked at several outcomes, including patients' ratings of their symptoms, their impression of whether the drug worked, and the duration of their cold. For the first four outcomes, the confidence interval includes zero. For #5, duration of the cold, they don't report that kind of confidence interval, but they report a p-value which tells you the same thing (if p>.05, then by convention the evidence is not strong enough). For #6 they used a test where the critical value for the confidence interval is 1 and not 0.  In other words, the clinical trial of this particular drug gives us little reason to believe that it works. That doesn't mean that it   work, but they certainly haven't made a convincing case.	2015-05-04 03:34:20Z	octern	2
825	865	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/865	Yes, this is normal. Normally, people do not feel their heart beating in their chest at rest. It is one of those things similar to breathing - it's happening, but we're not often aware of it (which is good as it might be very distracting otherwise.) However, an alteration in the steady background of the beating heart is often perceived. Sometimes the alteration is due to increased rate or force of contractions. If so, the sensation of feeling your heart beating (normally under the circumstances) is called   (i.e. normal.) If they are a result of an "abnormal" rate or rhythm, the phenomenon is known as "palpitations". The sensory mechanisms responsible for palpitation are unknown.   What we do know, though, is that if the heart beats faster or more forcefully, we do feel this, both in our chest, and in our necks, as exemplified in the expression, "my heart rose into my throat." We have baroreceptors in major blood vessels in our neck; when more blood is pushed into our arteries by a forceful beat, there is an awareness of increased pressure. A more forceful contraction means more blood is pumped in that heart cycle. This can happen if suddenly stressed (e.g. you're speeding and you see a police car pull into your lane behind you); the adrenaline increases both the rate and the force of your heartbeat.   Likewise, when you have a premature ventricular contraction, or PVC. The first beat is early; this allows the next cycle to have a longer "filling time", and the resultant more forceful contraction will be felt. Medically speaking: If you have an irregular heartbeat - the weaker ones will not be felt, but the more forceful ones will. This often is perceived as a fluttering in the chest. Finally, some people are just more sensitive to their heart beat. This also occurs in hypervigilant states.

In a healthy adult, the heart rate should average between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Factors that determine heart rate are activity level, exertion of the body, and even stress levels.  Heart palpitations or heart racing can be harmless and merely a response to activity, stress, etc. But in some cases, they can be the sign of a serious condition. When it comes to matters of the heart, it’s best to be on guard to help prevent any serious illness. Source: 	2016-11-14 14:35:58Z	Laura	-2

Therefore,   the gums will do   to improve your situation, especially if there is anything left behind, bellow the gums.  and other products you might try. They will hardly have any effect on the surfaces of the teeth above the gum line, due to the relatively short amount of time most people keep mouthrince in their mouth, the slow diffusion of the active ingredients across the calculus. It will not even reach below the gums wont remove/dissolve sub-gingival plaque or calculus.  On the other hand, if you chose to attempt to perform scaling deeper with picks, you risk  , especially since the "picks" will be pointed towards your gums, and you will eventually slide them too far and therefore damage even more the soft tissues that surround and support your tooth, potentially accelerating the recession, or worsening the inflamation.

Do not attempt to use them at home, on yourself, if you don't know what you are doing or lack good dexterity and technique. There are numerous videos on YouTube about how to use them.

The old wive's tale was immortalized by Jane Austin in her book,  , when the heroine's sister Jane falls ill after getting a soaking in the rain. This has been studied extensively. A New York Times article describes one such uncomfortable-sounding study: In other words, being cold had no effect on   a cold. A 1968 experiment studied the effect of (among other methods of chilling) a cold water bath at several stages during and after inoculation with rhinovirus (one of the many viruses responsible for the common cold). No effect. Yet the studies continue, because anything shown to decrease the incidence of the common cold would be beneficial to the sufferers, as in the US alone, 75 to 100 million physician visits are due to the common cold, and millions of days are lost from school and work. But what has never been proven is that getting chilled in any way causes one to come down with a cold.

What happens is that you breathe in fine particles with smoking, part of which your body gets rid of in the period after you had that cigarette. Another part settles in your lungs, but it's not going to get out. I'm guessing you're visualizing it as a collection of tar/dust in your lungs which you're going to cough out eventually if you keep coughing up enough. It simply isn't. You get mucus because of irritation/inflammation of the lungs due to smoking. What you are going to find is that your lung function gets better with time after smoking cessation. The amount of  mucus you cough up will likely also get less.   gives some interesting background information about what smoking cessation does to your lungs and body.	2017-07-14 12:19:15Z	Tami	1

806	818	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/818	A   review of an allergic response is in order so that the answer makes sense. Think of a linked chain of events here. An "allergen" is something a person is allergic to, e.g., cat dander or pollen. When someone is exposed to an allergen, they either become allergic or not. In a susceptible individual, something in the allergen (called an antigen, usually a protein of some kind) causes the person's immune system to produce an antibody (or Immunoglubin, in this case Immunoglobin E, or IgE) to the antigen, which then circulates throughout the entire system. The individual is now considered "sensitized". The IgE's bind to receptor sites on mast cell surfaces. When a sensitized individual is re-exposed to the antigen, the antigen binds to the IgE's changing the cell surface, triggering a response. Mast cells, found in connective tissues throughout the body - but especially in mucus membranes and skin - make and store a molecule called histamine. When the antigen binds to the IgE's on the mast cell, the cell is "signalled" to release (among other things) histamine, a molecule which causes local capillaries to swell and leak fluid: the typical runny/stuffy nose, red/itchy/watering eyes, etc. So that's a basic allergic response involving histamine. The antihistamine essentially blocks the effect of histamine on the capillaries. It doesn't decrease his immunity to the antigen (it doesn't stop IgE from being produced); it just treats the symptoms (stuffy nose, watery eyes, etc.) The antihistamine will have [little or]* no effect - either positive or negative - on his immune system. It is used only to make the allergic symptoms more tolerable. *

It's further perpetuated by badly applied mathematics. White adipose tissue has the responsibility for energy storage in the body. This tissue is composed of   (fat). If you take the commonly accepted 9 calories of energy per gram of fat (Which is also not quite accurate), you get the following formula: 9 (calories/gram) * 454 grams (grams in a pound) * .85 = 3465 calories. So, the original estimation was that there were 3500 calories in a pound of human fat, so to lose a pound you had to burn 3500 calories.

793	803	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/803	You seem to be equating food weight with body weight, and they are not directly related. Yes, if you eat a pound of something, you will immediately weigh one more pound, as your body has not had a chance to digest it and process it as needed. However, that doesn't mean that you will have gained one permanent pound. The body will break down the food, distribute the end result to various places for either use or storage, and get rid of whatever is not digestible. Weight fluctuates during the day, so the best gauge of your weight is to weigh yourself at the same time every day, under the same conditions. Track that number, and that gives you your true weight. Also, weight gain/loss is a relationship between how many calories you need to sustain your day to day activities, and how many you eat. If you consistently eat more calories than you need for a day, then you will gain weight. If you consistently eat less, then you will lose weight. The rate at which you do so varies on how big the deficit/surplus is, how efficient your metabolism, type of calories, many factors such as these. For your main question, 3500 calories per pound of food is very calorie dense.  . The higher the fat content, the closer you get to that mark. If you ate a straight pound of fat, for example, you would get just over 4000 calories. ( ). So yes, it is possible to get more than 3500 calories in a pound of food.	2015-05-01 00:58:49Z	JohnP	6

793	13192	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/13192	Forget calories and energy for a moment.  The only thing with mass(weight,on earth) are atoms.   When you weigh yourself, you are measuring the number of atoms you have(in pound units)in and on your body.  The only way for atoms to enter your body is through ingestion, inhalation or absorption through the skin.    The only way for atoms to leave your body is through urination, defication, sweat, exfoliation of skin, and exhalation.    Atoms absorbed or lost  through the skin are not a significant source of permanent, or long term, weight gain or loss.  So, the only way to gain more atoms (weight) than you eat through your mouth must be from the inhaled air.   The only significant inhaled atoms are molecules of oxygen (O2).  The only significant exhaled atoms are molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O).  Unless my logic is faulty, because molecules of CO2 and H2O have more atoms than O2,  breathing is a net source of weight loss for the body.  I would argue that the atoms of carbon in the exhaled CO2 are the primary way the body loses weight when on a diet!   The other significant pathway that atoms are lost from the body would be through the atoms of urea, CO(NH2)2, excreted in the urine.  The atoms in digestive enzymes and bile are removed from the body in feces.  However, I do not know if this is a significant source of atoms leaving the body.   In conclusion, I do not think it is possible to gain more body weight than the weight of the food you consume.  I will add that water confuses the issue.  It enters and leaves again in a variety of homeostatic mechanisms.  	2017-08-01 16:49:58Z	Ray L. 	-1

It is estimated that the average person stores about 1 mg (1000 µg) of B12 in their liver, and other smaller amounts elsewhere. The recommended daily allowance assumes a 50% absorption rate of ingested B12. This is a good question to discuss the limits of medical science. How is the requirement for B12 determined?  are those that follow people over many years (even decades.) Humans are not subjected to longitudinal studies involving, say, B12 because: Therefore different study models must be used, which give us less accurate information, such as retrospective studies, animal studies, studies of treatment of pernicious anemia (a result of B12 deficiency), pregnant and lactating vegans, people who have undergone certain bypass procedures, etc. By studying those patients, it can be determined how much B12 is necessary to the first signs of B12 deficiency away (usually apparent in blood). B12 is a particularly difficult vitamin to pin down because of its
complexity, the fact that it is synthesized by intestinal flora, and the various steps involved in its absorption which might be influenced by age and other factors. Again, the estimated daily requirement of B12 varies from ~ 2µg to 5µg. Since there are no known adverse effects of excess B12 intake, it's not unreasonable to take more than the minimum if warranted. However, a recommendation of 500 - 1000 µg/day seems quite unnecessary.	2015-04-30 22:55:24Z	anongoodnurse	10
788	4898	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4898	Let me address this point mentioned in the question: "My apothecary person told me 500-1000 µg per day are needed to even start absorbing meaningful quantities by ingestion." This is addresses a problem with the way we absorb vitamin B12. As  , when vitamin B12 is ingested, certain so-called transport proteins are needed to move it to the bloodstream. Now, at any given time you only have an amount of enzymes capable of transporting about 1.5 micrograms. When you take 5 to 50 micrograms, you saturate the capacity of the transport proteins, and you'll get colse to the maximum of 1.5 micrograms of vitamin B12 into your body. However, a small fraction of the vitamin B12, about 1% will pass through the stomach wall without the help of transport proteins. This means that you can evade the 1.5 micrograms per meal absorption limit by taking huge dosages of the order of many hundreds of micrograms. This is useful for people who are deficient, they'll typically have a problem causing vitamin B12 to not be absorbed using the transport proteins. Even if there is no problem here (e.g. in case of malnutrition) with only 1.5 micrograms per day, a deficiency cannot be corrected in a timely manner. High dose supplements or vitamin B12 injections must then be used.  The 200 micrograms prescribed by your doctor thus amounts to an effective dose of 1.5 micrograms plus 1% of 200 micrograms = 3.5 micrograms of vitamin B12 which within the range of the RDA.	2016-02-20 18:01:52Z	Count Iblis	-1

There are actually a number of resources out there that answer this question.   is a very dry (but unbiased) answer from the Canadian Paediatric Society written for paediatricians who are helping parents with this issue.  Here are some quick question to ask yourself when appraising the website you're looking at: 1) Most importantly, whose website is it? The most reliable are generally university or health agency websites. Next would be not-for-profit professional organizations (for example the American Academy of Cancer Researchers or the American Medical Association). Be wary of for-profit organizations and websites run by one individual or a small group of individuals. 2) Is the information referenced and peer reviewed? An unreferenced statement is useless. Even if it's referenced, the reference should ideally point to the peer reviewed literature, not to a secondary source (such as a news site). 3) Is the website itself peer reviewed? This isn't mandatory but it helps you have trust in the website. If you have the background you can go to the references and evaluate the literature itself - is the population described relevant to you? Was the intervention what you were looking for? This is advanced and probably unnecessary if you follow the other rules (especially number 1). The bottom line is that reputable organizations are likely to have accurate information. The NIH, CDC, or Mayo Clinic will always be more reliable than a single person's website (no matter who they are). Look for .gov or .edu at the end of the URL - these are reasonable indicators that the information has at least been vetted by more than one person.	2015-05-01 00:59:04Z	Jack	8

If so, here are some others you might want to try (i.e. read the product label and look for one of the active ingredients below). Note, these are "over-the-counter" options only (avaliable without a prescription). A doctor can prescribe other treatments that might not be listed below, or in a stronger formulation than what's available over-the-counter. You might also consider taking a break from using the Pantene products in contact with your face, and switch to something << >> a lot of moisturizers, and not containing silicone (that's usually what the "shine" ingredient is).  This might sound silly, but you could also try "baby shampoo" (fragrance/moisturizer free) for a while, particularly if you're alternating with the medicated shampoos as directed on their label.  One "last resort" option in this case might be to shave your beard (omg!), and see if that helps. You may be reluctant to try that, but remember you can always grow it back later. Howecer, if you do shave the beard and the condition resolves itself, it may be time to rethink the beard. :( If none of those work, it's probably best to see a doctor about it. They would be able to prescribe something more specific. They may end up prescribing something with one of those ingredients above, but in a higher strength. Alternatively, they might prescribe a topical steroid anti-inflammatory for you to use for a period of time, in case it's   dandruff and is actually something like eczema. Hope that helps!!

Most common reason for back and neck pain are muscle spasms. They are painful which cause more spasm a so a vicious circle is ready. Reason why people suffer from muscle spasm is multifactorial. Static working postures, poor muscle strength or generally bad posture leads to unfavourable muscle strains and spasms. Massage can be really effective for the treatment of these muscle spasms. Massage relieves tension, boosts the blood flow in muscle and helps to remove lactic acid stored in muscles. However, the spasms will definitely appear again if one does not to anything to treat the fundamental reasons why muscle spasm occurs. As so there is no long term effect with massage therapy. There are two Cochrane reviews published in this topic  ,  : There is no explicit evidence for the benefits, but what is important is that there is basically no adverse effects related to massage therapy. So in that sense massage can be helpful also for your mind and wellbeing. Exercise and education indicates the same thing I said in the beginning, in addition to relieving the spasms in your back you should also focus on the overall situation, "why do I have backpain". With regard to neck pain the evidence is much more controversial. My personal opinion is that this might be related to etiology of the pain and spasm.

This leads to the problem of obesity when people consume too many calories, pointing towards higher risks of cardiovascular diseases. High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) contributes to this problem because when consumed, it does not stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. In animal models, it even induces insulin resistance, leading to diabetes (1). Furthermore, HFCS  So even though you're taking in a massive amount of energy and overworking your liver, you don't feel full, which causes you to keep eating and drinking. For runners and other endurance athletes, this is ideal. They can store up massive amounts of energy without the need to stuff themselves until their stomachs are nearly exploding. For people who burn a massive amount of energy on a regular basis, HFCS comes as a good source for replenishing and preparing that energy for usage, but for everyone else who doesn't burn high levels of calories, this indicates a high influx of potential energy without anywhere to go.

That is because a seizure is likely to be provoked only by a pretty dire state of hypoxia — either not responsive to maximal interventions or occurring in a setting where such interventions are not available or not desired. To the extent that death is directly attributable to the seizure, it is generally because of what doctors often refer has “inability to protect the airway.” Normal, conscious people have reflexes that “protect” the airway at the level of the oropharynx to prevent aspiration. People having a generalized seizure lack such reflexes and can aspirate on their own oral secretions causing hypoxemic respiratory failure.

735	736	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/736	Most dentists - for   procedures - aim for a   experience. If there is reason to keep some pain sensation intact, the dentist will inform you, and ask at appropriate intervals if you can feel pain. The efficacy of lidocaine and other local anesthetics depends on how closely your nerve distribution comes to the norm (they will inject the environs of the "normal" anatomical position of the nerve), how much anesthetic is injected, whether there are local factors which alter the local tissue pH (e.g. presence of an abscess or infection), how quickly it is removed from the site, etc. Local anesthetics prevent pain sensation, but not vibration or pressure, which themselves can be unpleasant. Hypothetically, a dental procedure which should be painless with anesthesia can be carried out equally well whether the patient feels pain or not, so if you are stoic, feeling pain and not telling your dentist will not likely affect the outcome of that procedure. However, informing the dentist helps them to know if your anatomy is different (valuable information for the next time they need to do a similar local or regional block, your response to the anesthetic used (they might try another anesthetic or approach in the future), or if there might be an unseen infection altering the pH (and efficacy) of the anesthetic. Therefore it is probably wise to let your dentist know what you're feeling. They can reassess the situation, then offer you relief of some kind: a painless injection (the second injection into an already partially anesthetized region is truly painless), nitrous oxide (a gas), or other. I would liken this for most instances to suturing a laceration. There is   a time when I wish the patient to feel pain while I'm addressing the repair. I address what I see. If a patient feels pain, I want to know that and address the situation.  	2015-04-27 19:11:11Z	anongoodnurse	26

He was shocked, and immediately set about trying to determine the cause of the problem.   He spotted a bit of nerve fiber he had missed the first time, then completed the procedure.

732	733	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/733	Many patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer have their axillary lymph nodes removed.   One of the main roles of the lymphatic system is to assist in draining extra-cellular fluid to the thoracic duct and ultimately back into the blood stream.  Therefore, when axillary lymph nodes are removed, there is risk of developing lymphodema (swelling) in the corresponding arm.  This puts the arm at a greater risk of infection. When a blood pressure cuff is applied to the arm, the pressure of the cuff may further inhibit the drainage of the extra-cellular fluid in the arm, further enhancing the risk of the patient developing lymphodema. Therefore as a precuationary measure, it is not recommended to use a blood pressure cuff on the arm of the side effected by breast cancer. It is also recommended that injections are not given, and blood not taken from the affected arm.  This is because the removal of axillary lymph nodes results in a higher risk of infection in that arm. References:	2015-04-27 11:28:43Z	michaelpri	8

715	716	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/716	As a medical professional I find this very important question. No, OTC drugs are not any safer than drugs needing prescriptions. They are more dangerous. The rationale for this statement is that always when patients are given a prescription, a detailed dosing guidelines are given to patient. Also physicians make sure that the prescripted drug is suitable to use with existing medication without any adverse interactions. In contrary, people can buy OTC drug as much they can and use them how ever they feel it is possible. Of course, majority of patients ask or seek for guidance, but in population level there will always be the minotiry who use OTC drugs with high doses and experience adverse events.  They reason why paracetamol/ibuprofen/aspirin are OTC drugs is that these  drugs have quite a few interactions with other drugs. Paracetamol is the safest minding the correct dosing. Daily dosage exceeding 4g are associated to liver damage. Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs cannot be used with warfarin, which is pretty much the only major interaction. Adverse effects include GE tract bleeding and kidney injury if daily dosage is high or there is pre-existing condition. The rest of the drugs You mention are highly spesific drugs with complex mechanism of actions and they have many significant interactions and contra-indications. Proper assessment must done by a professinal and not by common people.  It varies from country to country and depends on local regulation which drugs are OTC. Usually the safest one are, like those you mention and for example antihistamins and some proton-pump inhibitioners. There must be an equilibrium which drugs are OTC and which are not. Certain drugs must be OTC so people can buy those freely and does not need to see a doctor every time they need paracetamol. That would pose a significant burden for health care system. Also, not all drugs should be OTC, most importantly those which have many major interactions and those which are suitable for abuse. Moreover, majority of drugs are used for treatment of chronic diseases so when people run out of prescription they must meet their doctor and thus the status of any illness can be assessed.	2015-04-26 19:34:08Z	arkiaamu	6
715	738	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/738	Generally, I'd say no, OTC medications are not safer than prescribed medications. However, I disagree with the opinion that they are more dangerous. Primarily I'd like to address a misconception people have about OTC medications (meds). (I will not discuss dietary supplements - also potentially very harmful - because the FDA does not regulate these.) Many people think that OTC meds are safe because "the government wouldn't let a dangerous medication be sold over the counter, would they?" In the US, the "government" usually is a reference to the Food & Drug Administration. The answer is: Just look at acetaminophen/paracetamol (ACAP). Before blister-packs were mandated for ACAP, it was the drug of choice for suicide in the UK. While it is true that the FDA must approve both OTC and prescription drugs, they are assessed for safety, efficacy, possible drug interactions, and  . ACAP is OTC because  , the benefits significantly outweigh the risks. This does not address OTC meds that were once FDA approved but have lost approval because of poor labeling practices Are prescription medications safer because they are "prescribed"? Not really, because many patients (in many studies, up to 50-60%, which is believed to be an underestimate) don't take their medication as prescribed. This poses a significant burden to health care costs and utilization.  Clearly not all medications eventually become OTC - I don't expect to ever see chemotherapy drugs go OTC, for instance. But many do. This has something to do with patent expiration, being beneficial to patients who can't afford a physician for treatment of common illnesses, e.g. gastric reflux or (in days bygone) gastric ulcers. Allergy medications usually become OTC, antibiotics (in Mexico and other countries), etc. Drugs are drugs, inherently dangerous when the risk outweighs the benefit or when used improperly. So is water. Too much or too little will kill you; it doesn't mean bottled water is safer than tap water in that instance.

713	722	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/722	The answer is "of course," but one must be careful about defining terms. Certainly the infection can persist for years in untreated patients.  That qualifies as "chronic."  There is no question that chronic Lyme disease exists as part of the natural history of Lyme disease. If you're asking whether the infectious agent can persist after what is normally a curative dose of antibiotics, the answer is also "of course."  A "normally curative dose" isn't going to be the right dose for everyone.  Some people will need more, or some people will have infection in an immunologically privileged area of their body.  It only takes one failure of the normally curative dose to make the answer to this scenario "yes," so certainly that has happened at some point.  How often is another question entirely. If you are asking whether ill effects of the initial infection can persist after treatment eradicates the organism, the answer is still yes.  Many infections continue to exert ill effects after eradication of the infectious agent because they have incited an autoimmune response from the body.  Antibiotics don't help autoimmune disorders.  But again, the right question is: how often does this happen? If you're asking whether people who get normally curative doses of antibiotics can continue to have wacky symptoms with no trace of the infectious agent nor objectively demonstrable pathology -- well, the answer is again "of course," but ... it is not (and cannot) be proven that their symptoms are due to the Lyme infection because, as noted, there is no objectively demonstrable pathology.  Maybe they were going to get those symptoms anyway.  Maybe their symptoms of physical illness are really symptoms of a mental illness.  There is also a big problem around the term "objectively demonstrable" -- it depends on how thoroughly the search is made.

There are some oils that are better, by this point of view, like canola oil, that has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, that are beneficial to cardiovascular risk.

In fact, herbalists have been advising their patients to rub onions on their scalps to cure grey hair long before any hair dyes were ever invented!  Back in 2009, Bradford University in the UK discovered that a build up of hydrogen peroxide in the hair follicles and scalp caused thinning and grey hair. They also discovered that the catalase enzyme neutralizes hydrogen peroxide and reverses grey hair.  So rubbing onions and onion juice mixed with lemon juice on your scalp everyday is a powerful reversal treatment for grey hair (the only down side is of course the smell). Wheat grass and barley grass are also rich in catalase, so mix up a paste and rub this onto your scalp everyday as well.  In addition to this, you can now buy catalase in supplemental form to take orally for extra benefit. And if you find you really can't stand the smell of the onion juice, you can always open or crush one or two catalase capsules and apply these directly to your scalp instead (mixed with a slight amount of water).	2016-10-26 17:59:32Z	Carey Gregory	1

Shift work however has been shown to increase the risk of some adverse health effects.  The following is a list of adverse health effects that have are commonly associated with those working shift work or working long hours: Scientific publications on the topic generally agree that working shift work or working long hours has adverse affects on sleep (1).  In particular the quantity of sleep may be reduced by up to 2 hours per day, with a reduction in REM and stage 2 sleep. It is logical that decreased sleep will also lead to increased levels of fatigue.  Reports of fatigue among shift workers is very common, and remains an important, but vague symptom often a major cause of shift work intolerance. There have been reports of increased anxiety and depression among shift workers.  The question of whether shift work   increased psychiatric morbidity however is still an open question, as correlation doesn't always imply causation. Scandinavian studies show that shift workers have a 40% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including angina, hypertension and myocardial infarction.  It is thought this increase risk may be associated with disturbances in the circadian rhythm, increased stress, poor diet and lack of exercise.   There is increasing evidence that shift work may lead to increased risk of spontaneous abortion, low birth weight and prematurity. The risks of developing any of these adverse health affects from shift work may also depend on age, sex and personality.  Evidence shows older people are able to tolerate shift work less than younger people.	2015-04-26 08:14:24Z	Kenshin	4

679	690	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/690	There has been a lot of debate over the topic of artificial sweeteners and weight loss. Some studies say that artificial sweeteners do promote weight loss, while others argue the complete opposite, that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain.  Most diet products use artificial sweeteners because they provide the sweetness of sugar without adding any extra calories. How this affects weight loss is uncertain. Several studies, both long term and short term, favor each side of the debate.  had two groups of obese men and women. Both groups were placed on the same diet, except that one group had aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in some diet products, added to the diet. Both groups also had regular exercise instruction. The men in both groups lost a significant amount of weight in the 12 week period, while the women, who also had good results, had more of a difference in the two groups, with the group whose diet was supplemented with aspartame losing about four more pounds on average. This showed that artificial sweeteners can help weight loss, but because the group was small (59), no firm conclusions could be drawn.   also showed positive results in taking aspartame. In a group of 163 obese women, some of them assigned to have products with aspartame and some assigned to abstain from it, it was shown that having aspartame promoted more weight loss and allowed more weight control during a follow-up period. This study had more conclusive evidence than the previous study, but still not enough to be considered definite.  whose results leaned towards artificial sweeteners promoting weight loss (but still inconclusive) tested beverages with aspartame or high-fructose corn syrup (which I won't talk about because it's usually not used in diet products) on normal-weight men and women. The beverages with aspartame did appear, relative to when no beverages were given, to reduce weight in male subjects, but did not have a noticeable effect on females. Once again, this leaves us with an unsatisfactory result. As I mentioned earlier, there are some studies that say artificial sweeteners don't have any significant effect on weight or sometimes even promote weight gain.   studied a few thousand people and asked them how often they drank beverages with artificial sweeteners. The amount of total consumption of artificial sweeteners was then estimated. About 7 or 8 years later, the subjects were re-examined and it was found that higher consumption of artificial sweeteners may be linked with a higher body mass index (BMI) and weight gain. There are many other factors that could've changed this result, and they were handled as well as they could, but still not perfectly. Because of this, the result is once again inconclusive. The study article even says, "There may be no causal relationship between [artificial sweetener] use and weight gain."  also says that there is no evidence that artificial sweetener consumption "helps weight loss or prevents weight gain." It showed no significant link between weight loss or gain and the amount of artificial sweeteners consumed. Of course, this study has many variables that were handled as adequately as possible, but still this leads to the real result of the experiment being inconclusive.  As we can see, it is nearly impossible to tell how artificial sweeteners affect weight loss. They're not really bad for your health, so it is fine to have them. It does seem that the studies that showed weight loss from artificial sweetener consumption had a higher percentage of weight difference than the studies that showed other results. From this you may conclude that the benefits outweigh the risks. The only thing I can recommend is to have artificial sweeteners in moderation, just like anything else. This can also be a controversial subject, but there are also studies on it. Sadly, they are inconclusive.  tested men and women with two groups, one was an artificial sweetener beverage group and the other was a water group. Both groups also took part in a behavioral weight loss treatment program. The results showed that the artificial sweetener group lost more weight on average than the water group. Still, this study was not large enough and did not have sufficient enough evidence to be considered conclusive. Whether diet products are better than water can still depend. You can argue the same as above that the benefits of artificial beverages outweigh the risks, but you could also say that water is a safe enough choice. This is usually up to whoever is debating between diet products and water, but your doctor can be contacted if the need is really felt. 	2015-04-25 07:02:59Z	michaelpri	8
679	10375	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/10375	You should avoid products that contain artificial sweeteners because it will only promote fat storage and weight gain according to  , it also promotes health problems associated with excessive sugar consumption, including Cardiovascular disease and stroke, Alzheimer's disease and artificial sweeteners stimulate appetite, increase cravings for carbs why? simply because your body are being fooled by artificial sweeteners by sweet taste but in reality, it has no calories inside. When we eat something sweet, our brain releases dopamine which activates our brain's reward center. The appetite-regulating hormone leptin that will inform your brain that you are "full" if a number of calories have been ingested. However, if we consume something that tastes sweet but doesn't contain any calories, our brain are still activated by these artificial sweeteners that we get sugar (calories), but when the sugar are not present, our body will still continue to give signal that we need more that will results in carb cravings so in short we are tricked by this artificial sweeteners. The study shows that it also worsen any insulin sensitivity and are promoting weight gain. Artificial sweeteners played a role in worsening the obesity and diabetes epidemics since their emergence in our food supply and these are added to about 6,000 different beverages, snacks, and food products, making label-reading an ever pressing necessity. Disturbingly, food industry groups are now trying to hide the presence of artificial sweeteners in certain foods. For a safer sweetener options, I suggest using stevia or Luo Han, both of them are safe natural sweeteners. Just keep in mind however that if you struggle with hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, or overweight, then you have insulin sensitivity issues and would probably benefit from avoiding "ALL sweeteners".	2016-12-06 05:12:28Z	Kate Forsyth	0
679	4314	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/4314	Where I live, diet products are mostly called "light". In the US you have Diet Coke, we call it Coca Cola Light. This goes for chips (like Lays) as well. Light chips have 30% less fat. However, it turns out that the law here says that to qualify for the "light" label, the product needs to have at least 30% less for one of fat, sugar or calories. So if your favorite chips have 30% less fat, they qualify as "light". But the law doesn't say that the other two (sugar and calories) should stay as they are. So Lays is free to add more sugar to it (or salt), thus compensating for the taste loss of the removed fat. I don't know how this works for Coke, where less sugar is probably not compensated with fat.  All in all, in products where fat is replaced with sugar (and salt), I guess there is no health benefit. I would think sugar and salt is even worse than non saturated fat. This reasoning won't work for all products, but "light" and "diet" are more about marketing than about health. 	2016-01-07 14:25:06Z	SPRBRN	-2

However, I am fairly certain that your numbness has nothing to do with your accident. When we are considering symptoms in limb and possible spinal injury the pathophysiology would be some kind of nerve or medullar compression in back causing symptoms in extremity. First of all, numbness you are feeling is not following any anatomical boundaries, ie. dermatomes  . You don´t specify exactly how you hurt yourself during the accident. For example, was there any forceful forward flexion in your lower back. Anyway, if you had injured your lower back in the accident, the most dreadful injury would have been a vertebral fracture. That would have been symptomatic instantly. We can rule that out. Another likely outcome from the accident would have been some kind of injury or trauma to any of intervertebral discs in your lumbar region. Repetitive strain or forceful movement can cause deterioration of   in those discs  . Weaking of   would result to disc herniation some time after the accident if another forceful movement is targeted to lower back  . It is however   that the time interval would be one and half years. A week or two would be very likely. There are some other more uncommon reasons for radiculopathy in younger persons, but none of them are not a result from injury  .  As so, I am fairly certain that your numbness is not due to the accident. Any form of neural damage or compression in peripheral nervous system is possible in your case but as far as the accident and possible injury to your lower back is considered, I will stick to the aforementioned.	2015-05-03 19:18:00Z	arkiaamu	1

If you do not have a heating pad or hot pack, you could also try soaking in a hot bath. A pain reliever with anti-inflammatory properties will be best since it can ease your pain while also restricting the amount of inflammation your gallbladder experiences Drink apple cider vinegar in water or apple juice to help relieve pain due to an attack. Apple cider vinegar also reduces cholesterol produced by the liver. Drink vegetable juice – not the premixed cocktail versions, but pure juice from vegetables. Rub castor oil over your abdomen, especially where your gallbladder is located. Drink salt water.

But ok, if you wanted to be absolutely sure, you really would have to precisely measure your calorie intake vs calorie expenditure (with a tool like cronometer or sth). And as far as gaining 100 grams in 2 days goes, that's just jumping to conclusions and easily falls within normal day-to-day weight fluctuations. I have personally lost almost 20 pounds in just 24 hours in a weight loss experiment - just to prove how much water weight can be lost (without burning off almost no body fat). And guess what...all that lost weight came back after just 2 days on my normal diet. In other words, those 100 grams could easily mean you drank 1 extra dl of water, or that you didn't visit the toilet before weighing, or something similarly insignificant. The only way to be sure whether or not you're gaining/losing actual body fat would be if you actually measured your body fat percentage...but even in this case, the measurements would not be precise enough to confirm what's actually happening if your weight changes by mere 100 grams.	2015-04-24 08:58:18Z	David Brown	6

663	986	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/986	The so-called halos are typical for spikes of intraocular pressure rise in high-tension glaucoma (or ocular hypertension) forms, most often in   which is a trigger for glaucoma in myopes and often begins in early adulthood.  The halos appear when a spike in intraocular pressure leads to  , as the corneal endothelial cells which permanently pump the nutritious water out of the cornea cannot compete with the high pressure pushing the fluid into the cornea anymore. Thus, the cornea fills with water, leading to temporary loss of visual acuity and, as an early symptom, to halos and rainbows around sources of light due to increased dispersion of light. The regularity of the extracellular matrix, which is crucial for corneal transparency, is disturbed by the intrusion of water leading to cell displacement. Basically, this can happen in other forms of high-tension glaucoma or ocular hypertension with momentarily raised intraocular pressure (IOP), too. Note that it only does in forms where the IOP rises quickly, whereas in a slow and constant rise (as it happens in many forms of chronic glaucoma) the endothelial cells can adapt and still drain the cornea from the excess water. So basically, the same happens in an attack of angle-closure glaucoma, just with the difference being that angle-closure glaucomas often don't go away without medical treatment, whereas in early adulthood IOP spikes due to MDS the halos often are the only symptom which is often triggered by exercise or in dim ambience light situations. This is due to the fact that when the iris moves (as in widened pupils due to adrenaline reactions when performing sports or whe the lights are dim) in a patient with MDS, it rubs against the lens, loses pigment by erosion and this then   (in the anterior chamber angle).

For example, an 8 ounce serving of fruit yogurt has ~ 300mg of calcium. This would also allow for cheese, which is also in the neighborhood of 300 mg for a 1.5 ounce serving. This makes it fairly easy to avoid milk. If you eliminate dairy, then your three best sources out of native food are going to be canned salmon, sardines and tofu. The salmon and sardines have calcium because they have the bones included. Tofu is ground up soybeans, and it has about 800mg of calcium per 1 cup. The canned fish is 200-300 depending on the size of the can/serving, etc. However, what makes it easier is to add fortified foods to your list. A single cup of calcium fortified orange juice has 500mg of calcium. That gets you half way there, and if you make a turkey sandwich with enriched bread and throw on some kale you can easily get to your daily requirement.

656	659	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/659	In a normal (i.e. lens intact) eye, that would, I think, be a problem. The aqueous humor is a self-replenishing system, whereas the vitreous humor is made and completed before birth. There is no replenishment of it, although, because it is near a capillaries bed, there is diffusion of small molecules like glucose back and forth that takes place between the blood and the vitreous humor. You're correct that the vitreous humor (initially a very well organized gel-like substance) liquifies as aging occurs, but the predominant effect of this is floaters (vitreous detachments*), retinal pulls, tears, hemorrhages and detachments. Fluid (aqueous humor) is produced by cells in the ciliary body (which is part of the ciliary muscle, with ligamentous connections to the edge of the lens) behind the iris. This fluid-filled space is called the posterior chamber. The fluid then passes from behind the iris into the anterior chamber, between the iris and the cornea, and finally drains through a permeable network (the trabecular meshwork) near the base of your the anterior part of the iris. So, there is constant production and drainage of aqueous humor, keeping the fluid level balanced. When too much fluid is made, or not reabsorbed, the anterior chamber bulges, deforming the shape of the vitreous humor and placing pressure on the optic nerve. There is no fluid exchange between the two unless there is disease of the posterior chamber. When the vitreous humor liquifies, the volume stays the same. If it could drain out of the trabecular meshwork, I would imagine there would be a much greater risk of more serious vitreous detachments and subsequent  retinal detachments. In the case of a lens removed in childhood, the vitreous humor, being a highly organized gel, is probably little affected by lens removal. With age, because liquifaction happens from the middle of the vitreous; the effect of loss of the lens is still probably small, but I imagine - I'm not an opthalmologist - it might be different for someone who has had a lifetime to accommodate.

648	745	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/745	The phenomenon you are describing and the one shown in the picture is known as Reynaud's phenomenon.  In cold temperatures, the body constricts the peripheral blood vessels to prevent losing heat from the blood to the outside air.  In Reynaud's phenomenon, this constriction is exaggerated  and may prevent blood flow to the fingers or toes (and sometimes other areas) giving rise to the pale appearance shown in your picture. Reynaud's phenomenon can be classified as primary or secondary.   Primary Reynaud's phenomenon, often simply referred to as Reynaud's disease is where the phenomenon is not associated with any underlying disease, and the cause is ideopathic (unknown).  Primary Reynaud's phenomenon is considered to be a benign condition. Secondary Reynaud's phenomenon occurs when there is an underlying disease that is causing the condition, the most common of which are connective tissue disorders such as lupus (SLE). For treating the phenomemon, your doctor will first want to ensure that you do not have secondary Reynaud's phenomenon, and if you do, the treatment will vary depending on the underlying disease. If you are found to have primary Reynaud's disease, then there are also a variety of treatment options available that should be discussed with your health care provider.  Some of the options include: In addition, your doctor will likely advise you to not smoke (as smoking is associated with lower skin temperature due to constriction of blood vessels), exercise more (as exercising can increase circulation) and control stress (which may help avoid attacks).	2015-04-28 06:03:13Z	Kenshin	4

It may happen with any kind of direct trauma, including (perhaps the worst?) a broken toe. It is similar to any other injury causing bleeding; the major difference is you can actually see the dark blood because the nail is transparent. Yes, it will disappear by itself, but as already noted by @JohnP, it will take a long time, as the clotted, thickened blood residue will be pulled towards the tip of the toe at the same rate that your toenail grows.  This is a picture of a subungual hematoma (SUH) after six months of growth:   As you can see, there is a nice, normal nail growing out. I will hazard a guess that this particular injury was a lot like yours by the ridge formed across the top of the new nail. This indicates that the nail was lifted slightly off the nail plate. Also, this is a   slow growing nail. Your SUH needs no treatment this far out.  As @JohnP noted, if there was significant injury to the growth plate, your nail may be permanently changed: it may be thicker, ridged, shorter, etc. But often this grows out without any problem. Acute care includes ice and elevation. If very painful, most doctors are capable of trephining the SH under sterile conditions (burning a small hole in the nail through which the blood may escape.) This sounds much worse than it is; in actuality, it provides immediate relief.

When under the nail, it appears as a black shape, usually a crescent. If the amount of blood is significant, or if the pressure of it causes pain, you should have it checked out by a podiatrist. It is also possible that if the trauma was severe, that there can be a risk of infection. It will last quite a long time, as the nails (both fingers and toes) are relatively slow growing (average 3mm/month). It is possible that you will lose the nail, although after a month that is less likely. It is also possible that the nail will not grow back in a normal shape, as you may have caused trauma to the nail bed. The black shape (old, clotted blood, actually) will move out with the growth, and may possibly cause nail splitting and separation from the bed in the affected area. Eventually it will reach the end of the nail and can be removed. While not urgent after a month, there are possibilities of complications, so if you notice any pain, further discolorations or odors, have it checked by a professional.	2015-04-23 16:47:50Z	JohnP	5

633	638	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/638	Detoxification is one of the primary functions of the liver. When you ingest something, if it is absorbed, it enters the portal vein which delivers the blood directly to the liver. There, the liver metabolizes, "detoxifies", excretes, synthesizes, and stores. The liver stores excess glucose in the form of glycogen, fat-soluable vitamins A, D, K, iron used for the synthesis of red blood cells, copper (used as an integral part of enzymes), fat, B12, and some other substances. (This is why eating polar bear liver results in hypervitaminosis A.) It does not store toxins. The liver has a staggering number of metabolic pathways involving a series of enzymatic reactions that neutralize and solubilize toxins for excretion by the liver or kidney. It should be noted that some of the same enzymes are used to render "pro-drugs" into active drugs, and that delivery of absorbed molecules directly to the liver (where they may be converted or removed, called "first pass" metabolism) is the reason that some drugs simply are less effective or ineffective if taken by mouth. (The gut also is responsible for some metabolism.) This is so much a feature of the liver that first-pass metabolism of medications must be taken into consideration to determine the right dose of a drug. Generally lipid soluble toxins are first made water soluble by any of a group of enzymes called the CYPs, e.g. cytochrome P450. Each of these enzymes has the potential to alter very many different toxins. Liver enzymes then add another water soluble molecule (called conjugation) to the toxin which renders it less toxic and water-soluable enough to be transported for excretion by the liver (with bile, which is excreted into the intestines and carried out of the GI Tract) or the kidneys (in urine). Toxins can kill the host, injure a specific tissue (for example, an overdose of acetaminophen can cause enough liver damage to shut down detoxification leading to death), act as carcinogens altering DNA, be metabolized and excreted, sometimes be stored in adipose tissue (fat), or take other routes through the body. I personally know of no toxin (nor could I find one) that can bypass these things and be stored in the liver. There are toxins that damage the liver: alcohol for example. Yet that doesn't get stored in even a damaged liver. Clearly there are toxins everywhere that we don't even know about, but if drugs and toxins* studied are metabolized and excreted by the liver (or follow other routes), it stands to reason that the ones we don't know about are probably being handled similarly. *Disclaimer: Heavy metals are handled differently. Also, this answer doesn't deal with concentration of toxins in other tissues, e.g. fat. (Some toxins are stored in fat cells, and become mobilized again on weight loss.)

As you have said, the claims are vague, often saying that these "toxins" (not specified) are the cause of a catch-all list of symptoms. Unsurprisingly, they are usually associated with some sort of "detox" product or program. After all, the premise of "toxins accumulate" goes hand-in-hand with "therefore we need to detox." There is no medical standard for this type of "detox." There is no consistency in the ingredients of these products. There is no scientific evidence that these things help your health. There are "success stories." Some people may feel better after treatment. But those that feel worse are often told that this is part of the process, that they will feel worse before they feel better.

Cooking doesn't change the overall charge of molecules in food, you can't create or destroy charges out of thin air. To change the charges, essentially the pH of your solution, you need to either add acid or base. Of course you do that quite often in cooking, but the cooking process itself can't change any charges by itself. And even if it did, stomach acid has a very low pH and will change the charges of food anyway.  The Kirlian photography is pretty, but that's it.

Also, addiction has been studied in relation of people's habit of eating food that is prepared with a combination of ingredients, as donuts or french fries, not separated ingredients. There are many studies that  , similar to that caused by drugs such as cocaine, heroin, alcohol and tobacco (Blumenthal & Gold, 2010; Moreno & Tandon, 2011). Dr. Ifland identifies the  . Our body is programmed to recognize sugars and fatty substances as fundamental for life and health: they're energy reserves and address us toward the consumption of fruit, rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals. With the refining of foods we have an exaggerated concentration of sugars and fats, and this disrupts our evolutionary adaptation (Ifland et al., 2009). In the   of addiction, there are at least three factors that contribute to the excessive consumption of foods. In the case of sugar and refined flour, part of the explanation goes through the concept of glycemic index: foods with   - and load - cause a rise in blood sugar, which leads to an increase of insulinemia and subsequent hypoglycemia that is felt as hunger (Lennerz et al., 2013; Ludwig, 2002). Other explanations rely on the production of   caused by sugars that then would act as stimulants (Drewnowski, Krahn, Demitrack, Nairn, & Gosnell, 1992, 1995), and the lower efficiency of  , which would lead to increased consumption of food to achieve the same satisfaction (Wang et al., 2001; Wang, Volkow, Thanos, & Fowler, 2004).

I can only give you information in general (See above) but should not and cannot accurately say anything about you personally, obviously. In general, if your pain is well controlled, then it seems like surgery would not really be something you want (there are obvious risks of head surgery).  So the question is what else would the MRI reveal that would change the course of your illness.  If for pain you would not need it, then what else?  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is certainly on the differential for many many symptoms, but if you and your doctor think it is highly highly unlikely based on your history, then it might not be something you want to formally rule out with an MRI. If the concern is for a growing mass (such as cancer), the MRI can certainly be helpful.   There is no great evidence for a person in your situation.  It will have to be a decision that you and your provider make after considering the risks and benefits. To answer your secondary questions, your presentation is not consistent with MS diagnostically, as the McDonald criteria requires a person who has had more than 1 attack in just 1 clinically suggestive location, to have some kind of dissemination in SPACE.  You have only one location thus far.  Regardless, progression of MS can take years to decades.  Without further information, it would be hard to say in your case how unlikely it is that you have something that will progress to MS.  You can talk to your provider.	2016-03-12 21:53:53Z	Rakesh Patel	1

In short it is partially to meet the needs of a small but growing group of people who are allergic to gluten and also to catch people who are taking part in the gluten free fad. The main reason is that there are different conditions out there that cause a person to have issues dealing with gluten one of them is a condition called celiac diease ( / ) This is something that can be a very serious issue for people that have it Osteoporosis, a disease that weakens bones and leads to fractures. This occurs because the person has trouble absorbing enough calcium and vitamin D.
Miscarriage or infertility.
Birth defects, such as neural tube defects (improper formation of the spine) caused by poor absorption of such nutrients as folic acid.
Seizures.
Growth problems in children because they don't absorb enough nutrients.
Cancer of the intestine (very rare). People with one of these conditions need to avoid all foods with gluten in them in order to avoid the effects of the condition The second reason that food are made this way are because going gluten free has become a fad and food manufacturers are just cashing in on the latest trend. Now when it comes to gluten free food there are some things that you need to remember. First there are types of gluten free food. The reason that knowledge is important is that people who have a sensitivity to gluten can easily have issue from cross contamination. An example of this would be if a pizza place was making a gluten free pizza but they used the sauce and ladle that is used on normal pizza which will bring in contaminates to the gluten free food.	2015-04-20 22:50:40Z	Joe W	2

Generally the mnemonic for securing the straps is My Baby Looks Hot Tonight. It is to be noted, that recently in the US, the recommended order is My Baby Looks Totally Hot, recommending securing the Top before the Head. Some of the reasons behind the order are that if the top is secured first, it creates uneven pressures (Think of a teeter totter, securing one end pushes the other away), and that securing one end does not prevent the other from sliding around. This is why torso and body are secured first. According to the  , there is no peer reviewed support for preferred strap order: The most recent user manual that I could find is dated 2001, and it recommends the MBLHT order of strap securing. I did find a   dated 2009, which states that they will be following the manufacturers recommendation: However, these are all dating from up to 2009, and several forum postings from 2011 and later suggest that the order changed, and this is supported by the   by the National Registry for EMT's (NREMT) in the United States.  Further supporting this is   which also specifies the head being last (Step 4). In the absence of evidence to the contrary (Such as a current user manual), I would state that the current recommendation in the United States is the MBLTH order, with the head being last. (It is to note that this is different than when I was certified EMS, in that the Top was the last strap, not the Head). As far as the differences between different countries/districts, I would posit that they are following whatever protocol exists, and it either was not updated, or there was a feeling that no update needed to be made in this case.

Some researchers hypothesis that it is the resveratrol that leads to reduce atherosclerosis. This thought comes from the French paradox or the resveratrol paradox [ ]. The paradox is why do the French live so long with a diet high in saturated fats while they also consume a lot of red wine (since alcohol is a poison). However, correlation doesn't equal causation, i.e, there can be third a factor. Researchers from Harvard found that being stressed and unhappy can have lasting negative effects on the body [ ]: How does this relate to moderating drinking? It relates to moderate drinking through research on social circles and prolonged life spans. A team of Australian researchers found that individuals with stronger and bigger social circles have a longer life span [ ]. How do we parse this information? Many who drink moderately tend to go out for that glass of wine and when they go out there is a social aspect to the setting. Husband/wife, children, dinner with other couples, etc. That is, there is a continual social bound occurring. So is it alcohol that is benefit or social circle? Does a positive social circle have an effect on stress and longevity? Luckily   from the University of Pennsylvania has already done the research. His work as well as many other researchers on the subject are cited, quoted, and expanding on in   by Katie E. Cherry, Loren D. Marks, Tim Benedetto, Marisa C. Sullivan, and Alyse Barker: Hummer et al. noted that the key to longevity was the frequency of attending a social event in this case church, but if you read the entire pub med paper in [ ], you will see this extends to non-church social event frequency as well. So researchers have shown that social circles lower stress, keep people happy, and promote longevity. Many of the researchers who look at moderator drinkers don't look at the social aspect of the group just the fact that they (A) consume moderate amount of alcohol and (B) haven't died of a heart attack. Therefore, they conclude A causes B but A could be causing more social get togethers where the moderate consumption of alcohol occurs and these social settings will help reduce stress, promote community, and belonging which promotes longevity which leads to lower rates of atherosclerosis. From the American Red Cross circulation   [ ]: That is, alcohol has no formal recommendation and light consumption may be  , but again there is no mention of environment. Moreover, the Mayo Clinic makes the same statement but never analyzed the persons environment as well [ ].  Until more studies start to look at social environmental factors and not just the consumption point of view, I don't think ingesting a poison to maximize life expectancy is the way to go since there is no medical recommendation on doing so; hence, it is still called the Resveratrol paradox and not a theory or fact.	2015-04-20 17:05:00Z		6

As we know the pesticides needs to be toxic to kill pests, therefore potential long-term health effects of exposure to pesticides can include: cancer, neurotoxic effects and many more . Under the FQPA, EPA has the authority to ensure that all pesticides meet the safety standards. They estimates the exposure to a pesticide from different sources such as food, determine the health risks and set the limits of tolerance which is maximum amount of pesticides that is permitted in/on the food. This is systemically tested as part of the  . The recent meta-analysis of 343 studies from 2014 shown that organic food has 4 times less  , toxic/heavy metals (e.g. Cd and Pb) and other chemicals than in conventional crops which can bioaccumulate in the body over time  . According to EWG, buying certain organic food can significantly lower residue exposure , because organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical products and certain mineral fertilisers. The toxicology of natural and synthetic chemicals is similar, so it's probable that almost every fruit and vegetable contains natural pesticides . One scientific literature notes: Therefore it's not possible to determine health benefits of eating organic food by measuring how much pesticides remain on food as it really depends on agronomic practices/protocols and soil pollution which can affect crop composition. Therefore eating organic fruits in general is safe and you shouldn't worry about pesticides too much.	2015-04-20 17:55:05Z	kenorb	7

In adolescent scoliosis, it seems that presence of scoliosis is mostly associated to genetic factors  . 97% of patients presenting with adolescent scoliosis have a positive familial history  . A recent review article sums the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of scoliosis (Dayer et al.). The interactions in molecular level, brain, vestibular system and in structural biomechanics are extremely complex and authors conclude quite fairly: "Many factors are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of adolescent scoliosis, leading some authors to formulate a complex collective model from these different concepts." As so there is not currently any explicit evidence which would state the harms of any static risk factors (sleeping) affecting to development of scoliosis. Partly due to this vagueness I think the debate regarding risk of scoliosis is prone to bias and emotional "truths" and wisdoms. In a recent population level study, authors found that sleeping in hammock was inversely associated to scoliosis  . Still, it's possible that this study failed to take into account the possibility that children with scoliosis might be less likely to sleep in a hammock because of possible back pain in the morning. Correlation (or inverse correlation) does not imply causation.	2015-05-04 12:19:25Z	Dave Liu	6

As an example of this idea of risk-to-benefit ratio, lets take getting into a car. There is   a risk to getting into a car. After all, they move quickly, slide on slippery roads, and hurl towards (and potentially  ) each other at a frightening rate of speed. You probably know someone who died in a car accident. Yet, probably without giving it a single thought - except when you're buckling your seat belt - you get into a car several times per day/week. Because the benefit (distance transportation, convenience) is higher than the risk of injury in a motor vehicle accident (this example is actually flawed, but we'll ignore that for the moment.) Similarly, there is   a risk to getting an xray, but sometimes you just have to get them. The risk is low compared to the benefit. You wouldn't want anyone putting you in a cast without knowing what kind of bone fracture you had, because some kinds need to be casted differently, some need to be casted longer, some need operative repair, and some only need a splint. The benefit outweighs the risk. There is no completely safe lower limit of radiation. Radiation (especially in fetuses and children) increases the likelihood of cancer. Our information comes mostly from atomic bomb survivors, people exposed at Chernobyl (nuclear reactor accidents), people treated with high doses of radiation for cancer and other conditions, and people exposed to high levels of background radiation, e.g. uranium miners. Radiation doses are measured in   (mSv). For comparison's sake, you should know that, depending on where you live,  Is that safe? What is your chance of getting a lethal cancer from that? The answer is: no one knows. It depends on a lot of unmeasurable things: genetics, your age, your ability to repair the damage, which area of the body is being dosed, whether there are other carcinogens at work (e.g. viruses or co-carcinogens), etc. The following all give you a (estimated)   chance of dying from that event: So, you can estimate that (maybe) the risk of dying from a 7 mSv CT scan is about equivalent to driving 2800 miles. Taken individually:  As often as necessary. As long as the benefit outweighs the risk. No, there's no maximum limit. The risk is cancer. The risk is low, but not negligible. It doesn't go up linearly with every Xray study you have. Yes; cancers are often life threatening. What can you do about it?

 , but I will also address this in a general context of what experts recommend and nutrient content. When people talk about eggs, they usually want to talk about cholesterol. The problem is that the body doesn't fully absorb all of the cholesterol, so there's no hard rule. What we do know is: Registered dietitian Leslie Beck recommends: However, for healthy people with no medical condition, regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are better strategies to guard against heart disease and stroke, not cutting down on eggs (for   -   of the population). The two studies cited indicate that consumption of eggs does not raise cholesterol levels significantly for about 3/4ths of the population. Each egg yolk contains 6 g of fat and 54 kcal. Even though they're full of nutrients, they still do contain calories, so factor that into your daily intake. Someone who does an average amount of physical activity would probably require an average amount of eggs. Definitely not something on the level of dozens, but even so, giving any numbers would be hard since there are so many factors in play. Eggs are naturally rich in vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12, vitamin D, selenium and iodine. They also contain vitamin A and a number of other B vitamins including folate, biotin, pantothenic acid and choline, and essential minerals and trace elements, including phosphorus.  Before reaching a daily recommended value of any of these nutrients though, you would probably far exceed the daily recommended values for fat and calories first, but it's possible to overdose on anything, so be sure to keep track of how much of these nutrients are in each egg that you consume in the event that you're burning off all the fat and calories. To know your "maximum" number of eggs, you should probably talk to a dietitian.	2015-04-25 00:34:15Z	Dave Liu	20

521	535	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/535	The basic idea is that  To understand this, consider a basic homeostatic feedback loop that controls respiratory drive. During a breath hold, carbon dioxide levels rise and oxygen levels fall. Carbon dioxide diffuses across the blood-brain barrier and causes a decrease in CSF pH sensed at central chemoreceptors in the brainstem. The peripheral serum pH may also be depressed, stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. In normally ventilating people, these "hypercarbic indicators" are the primary mediators of the drive to breath. In patients with chronic hypoventilation, PaCO  is chronically elevated. Common hypo-ventilatory diseases include: The old theory goes that because these folks have chronically elevated PaCO *, the hypercarbic respiratory feedback loop described above “acclimates” and is no longer the primary driver of breathing. Instead, they rely on the  , which is secondary in normal people. These individuals may have a usual SpO  ~88-90%. When a non-rebreather mask is applied and suddenly drives their SpO  up to 100%, their respiratory drive decreases because their blunted hypercarbic response mechanisms do not respond normally to the progressive rise in PaCO .  There are data in support of this theory.   administered 100% oxygen to patients with COPD and observed a 18% decrease in ventilation after 15 minutes that returned to baseline when oxygen was removed (Aubier). However, these authors also showed that two other factors were at play explaining the observed rise in PaCO :  (Wijesinghe). In light of this,   investigated the best strategy for oxygen administration in patients with chronic hypoventilation (Kim). They found that a strategy titrating oxygen administration to achieve SpO  88% to 92% minimized the risk of worsening hypoventilation while achieving adequate relief of shortness of breath and adequate oxygenation.  provides a bit more detail for those interested (Abdo).        	2015-04-16 12:24:26Z	Susan	7

However honing in on the question of randomized clinical trials on the effects of blood donation,   (FeAST) was conducted by Dr. Zacharski et al. in 2007, examining the effects of phlebotomy on the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  The study found that a reduction in body iron stores did not significantly decrease all-cause mortality or death plus nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. This FeAST trial has several limitations one primarily being that the trial focused on secondary prevention in patients who had existing PAD, rather than focusing on primary prevention as postulated by the iron hypothesis.

The question boils down to:  This is a question relevant for Eastward travel. It also comes into play during the spring time change for those who live where DST is observed as well as in the shift from weekend/holiday to weekday sleep patterns for many. Begin by thinking of your body’s circadian pattern on an X,Y graph  where: = time

 Your goal (“phase advance”) is to shift this curve leftward by three hours along the   axis.  When attempting to manipulate circadian phase, the key is to understand your body’s  .Your body intrinsically has circadian oscillators that confer the cycle and determine the period; Zeitgebers are external agents that   this oscillation by maintaining or shifting it along the   axis.

The optimal stimulus is going to be bright light in the blue frequency range, and the optimal timing is going to be about 2 hours before your habitual wake time. (About 45 min duration is probably just as good as a longer duration.)  Practically, a good tip is: for two days prior to leaving, set your alarm an hour early and expose yourself to bright light (either broad-spectrum sunlight or blue light from a lightbox) for 30-45 min immediately upon waking. Each day’s exposure can be expected to achieve a 1-1.5 hour phase advance, and this protocol can be remarkably effective for mitigating the jet lag on the following day when you need to get up 3 hours prior to your habitual wake time.  mentioned melatonin. Administered exogenously, this is indeed another Zeitgeber, although much less powerful than light. Melatonin also has a phase response curve that turns out to be basically 180º shifted relative to the light PRC. That is, if the optimal timing for light to phase advance is around 2 hours prior to the habitual wake time, the optimal timing for melatonin administration will be 12 hours prior to that. For most people that corresponds to  4-6 hours prior to their habitual bedtime. Eating and exercise are both fairly weak Zeitgebers, and I wouldn’t worry about them too much.

The benefits of napping could be best obtained by training the body and mind to awaken after a short nap. Naps of fewer than 30 minutes restore wakefulness and promotes performance and learning . Before going sleep, it's important to create an environment which can help you to sleep by relaxing your mind and body, and everyone have their own way, so here are some suggestions: Read more:	2015-04-14 20:26:21Z	kenorb	6
502	513	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/513	To turn this question on its head, I'd like to propose a different question that the AIDS deniers haven't answered. If HIV were not the cause of AIDS, why would   be so successful in preventing the disease? Each of the meds in the cocktails that stave off AIDS limit the ability of the virus - the HIV virus - to reproduce. It can be argued that AZT is effective against more viruses than HIV alone. Reverse Transcriptase (necessary for viral replication) is an enzyme necessary to the replication of many viruses. However, the AIDS denialists claim: AZT is not an antibactial. Antibiotics (as well as things not to be taken internally, e.g. bleach) are antibacterials. Antibiotics treat   (formerly known as  ) and other microbial infections; they are useless against the common cold and other viruses.  Pneumocystis first came to attention as a cause of interstitial pneumonia in severely malnourished and premature infants during World War II in Central and Eastern Europe. Today, it is more common in immunosuppressed patients:  An antibiotic can treat P. pneumonia in HIV-infected patients, but cannot restore immunocompetency; only anti-retrovirals can. On the near-miraculous effect of combined antiretroviral in the treatment of HIV, your paper observes: But they offer no evidence of such a claim. No drug is without potential side effects. Some antibiotics can cause aplastic anemia, a condition certain to result in an immunocompromised status. However combined antiretrovirals save lives, they do not   AIDS. The paper is full of similar holes. Deniers gain footholds by building straw men and knocking them down, not by advancing credible science. Untreated, HIV causes AIDS. Anti-retrovirals prevent it's development.

501	512	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/512	The OP observes: Although   smoking often does lead to changes in the lungs that cause hypoxemia (low peripheral O  Saturation, a.k.a. SpO ), these effects are not immediate. In fact, in the short term, SpO  may even be spuriously  , consistent with your observation. We should distinguish between the factors that drive changes in O  saturation in long-term when compared to short-term smoking.*  discussed the increased carbon monoxide (CO) levels in smokers, which     (i.e. heavy smokers will inhale more CO than light smokers).   measures the percentage of circulating hemoglobin to which oxygen is bound. By standard pulse oximetry,  . Also, carbon monoxide causes a left-shift of the  . This means the hemoglobin is holding onto the oxygen more tightly, resulting in a higher saturation of hemoglobin. It is for both of these reasons that students are often taught about the   and mucous membranes in carbon monoxide poisoning.** In contrast to hypoxemia (low SpO ) when mucous membranes tend to turn blue due to low oxygen saturation, the hemoglobin saturation in carbon monoxide poisoning will be seen (both by our eyes and by pulse oximetry) as high.    In most young, healthy people, oxygen saturation is 98-100% anyway, so this difference is usually negligible. However, the point remains that the OP’s observation is fully consistent with the effects of short-term smoking. Long-term smokers frequently do have low oxygen saturation   the spurious elevation due to carbon monoxide. A full explanation of the mechanism would require a textbook of respiratory physiology. The basic idea is that the toxins in cigarette smoke lead to inflammation and remodeling in the lung that cause both   and  .  It has been shown that  . These microscopic changes in the lung do not cause measurable changes in oxygen saturation or pulmonary function tests.

501	505	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/505	Yes, SpO2 levels can be depressed in smokers, but the body will compensate for some of the effects which can explain why you may have had normal saturation levels. There are also age considerations, as well as how much a person smokes. One of the culprits in cigarette smoke is CO, or Carbon Monoxide. CO shares the same binding sites as O2 in blood hemoglobin (Hg), and actually has 200 times greater affinity than O2. So when you smoke, the CO travels across and prevents some Hg from picking up oxygen. The net result is that your heart starts working harder to get more blood around, which can keep up your sat levels. There is a decent  . In addition to this, there are other changes that can occur in longtime smokers.   from 1983 found that in females and smokers over 50 have associated increases in red cell volume and reduced plasma volume. This suggests that the body adapts to the decreased O2 count by producing more RBC's. While this sounds like a great adaptation, it also means that with the reduced plasma volume, the blood is "thicker", which means that the heart has to work harder to push it around.  also notes decreased plasma volume and greater RBC counts in long time CO exposure subjects as well as other significant blood composition changes. TL;DR: Yes, O2 saturation is impaired by continued exposure to CO as a long term effect. However, the good news is that the body is remarkably resilient, and depending on length of time a person smokes, the body will start reversing the effects of smoking within a week or two.

501	15087	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/15087	It would be great if high O2 saturdation did not constitute a false reading for heavy smokers like myself.  The CO binds with the RBCs.  Our RBCs are, essentially, too "thick," hence all the applicable vascular disasters.  Being told that a 100% O2 reading is "wonderful" by a medical provider who is fully aware of a patient's heavy smoking, on the one hand, and, by that provider to stop smoking, is an 'interesting' paradox.  It doesn't state here, but I suspect that there could be a sudden drop in O2 - each 1% decrease, if not attributable to other causes, is a substantial decrease.  96% O2 might be less than 90%, in reality, right?	2018-01-24 03:42:15Z	Jane	0
501	14927	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14927	My comments are strictly for the open minded! I am a 50 year old chronic cigarette smoker and my readings are usually in the range of 97 - 100 when my hands are warm. I have had readings of 100+ on a few occasions which I assume to be a fault of the machine! I think it is highly plausible that smokers have less oxygen running around the blood stream and as JohnP points out CO has very pointy elbows
in a queue to get on the bus! But where I differ is that this is not neccessarily a bad thing! It could actually be theraputic for certain conditions where a there is less oxygen in the blood stream than is desirable. Take for example emphysema. In  , where the study subjects were   and asked to self report on their health and smoking status.It showed that never smokers have a higher percentage of pretty much all diseases (including cancers and hypertension etc) with the exception of bronchitis and emphysema which is consistent with a causal hypothesis for smoking.  For persons over the age of 45 the percentages are for bronchitis and emphysema: So smokers have double the risk for bronchitis and emphysema compared to never smokers and although this risk is not as great as many figures that the anti-smoking industry alludes to , it is however a significantly larger risk. And as this study is   it is likely to be a fair
reflection of reality.  See above figures in table below. Both smokers and former smokers have roughly double the rate of bronchitis and emphysema which is consistent with the hypothosis that
smoking caused these conditions through some unknown mechanism. But it could also be that smokers are choosing to smoke because they feel an immediate therapeutic effect from smoking. And stopping smoking did not significantly reduce the number of former smokers that got the disease (7.8% vs 7.6%) which suggests that smoking may not be causal and could be merely therapeutic.  Paracetamol has an immediate therapeutic effect for people but we don't just assume that it causes every disease known to human kind just because 
people that use it have diseases. We know that it is an analgesic and people use it for pain relief. If tobacco were paracetamol, the anti-smoking industry could plausibly claim that it causes all known diseases but without supporting evidence it would be foolish to believe it. If it is true that healthy smokers go about their day to day business with significantly less oxygen than their never smoking friends then this is another way of saying  . It is as if smokers are just permanently altitude training. When never smokers do their daily business at sea level smokers are doing the same but a few thousand feet further up. This is all quite rational I think. But is there evidence that smoking has an immediate therapeutic effect for oxygen starved people? I can find anecdotal evidence from mountain climbers here is a quote from a Mount Everest expedition in 1922.  Take this study of coal miners   it could be that smoking contributed towards their condition but it is also equally rational that many smokers just felt an immediate therapeutic effect as our mountaineering friends said. The important point here is not whether smoking helped them, our mountaineering friends, to cope with less oxygen, although it may well have done as they clearly thought it did, the point is that they felt it did, hence possibly explaining the roughly double risk for bronchitis and emphysema for smokers in the above study.	2018-01-10 15:44:46Z	Fredrik Eich	-2

Most patients (both tinnitus and hearing loss) reports that the frequency of the tinnitus correlates with the severity and frequency characteristics of their hearing loss and that intensity of the tinnitus is usually less than 10dB above the patient's hearing threshold at that frequency However the risk of hearing loss is not related to specific sound frequency, but rather to sound pressure (loudness) as it's stated in the article which you linked: Tinnitus is one of the most important symptoms that can signal the onset of acoustic trauma. Those exposed to over 85 decibels of sound continually are at a higher risk for acoustic trauma.

There is major epidemiological evidence stating the association between moderate or traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimers (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) (Gardner and Yaffe 2015).  There are several studies investigating association between one time MTBI and dementia. Schofield and co-coworkers stated "Incident Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with head injury which occurred within the preceding 30 years"  . There have been many recent studies in this topic. Lee et al. stated "TBI is an independent significant risk factor of developing dementia even in the mild type"  . Nordströn et al. stated "In the present study, we found strong associations between YOD (young onset dementia) of non-AD forms and TBIs of different severity"  . All these studies are cited in recent literature review in which authors state "Taken together, these studies suggest that there is likely a small, but significant, risk of dementia following a single MTBI that is not solely due to reverse-causation or confounding. It is likely, however, that younger adults may be more resilient or may take longer to develop dementia than older adults who sustain a MTBI" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015).   CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) is a neurogenerative disease linked to exposure to repetitive MTBI  . CTE has been associated with mood, behavior, cognitive, and/or motor symptoms (including parkinsonism and/or motor neuron disease). CTE is officially   diagnosis. Prevalance of CTE among former professional American football players have ranged from 50% to 97%. In one study stage of CTE was associated to years of football exposure, "lending weight to a true causal association" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015).  As so there is mounting evidence of the association between (repetitive) MTBI and neurogenerative diseases but there are many epidemiological ("secular trends","reverse-causation") and study protocol related (clinical criteria for CTE, quantification of MTBI) issues which warrant further research in this topic. Authors of the recent review state "Recently, large epidemiological studies have reported that MTBI and repetitive MTBI are also significant risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, but these associations are not yet aswell established and require further replication" (Gardner and Yaffe 2015).  	2015-05-02 07:17:50Z	arkiaamu	3

So shampooing in the modern sense (water to produce a soapy lather) is only about 100 years old. Our modern shampoos are a combination of   (such as  ) which dissolve natural oils ( ) and remove dirt particles. As result, it reduces the natural oils in your hair and scalp making it drier than usual, causing the scalp to produce more oil to compensate. According to some dermatologists, a gradual reduction in shampoo causes   to produce sebum at a slower rate resulting in less oil on the scalp and in the hair . Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University explains: She recommends that patients wash their hair no more than two or three times a week. In the 2010 book Packing for Mars, Soviet research said : However this could vary greatly from person to person, as some people could respond better to some products with different concentrations of surfactants. For example if you have "oily hair" you need a higher concentration of SLS to help dissolve the oils, when you have "dry and frizzy hair", it would exacerbate the problem.

482	485	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/485	This a vast topic, and sorry for the superficial nature of my answer.  Iron is an essential component of  . Hemoglobin is a coloured pigment which binds to oxygen and carries it across the body. It binds to oxygen at a place where there is high oxygen tension (for example, lungs) and release it at a place where there is low oxygen tension (such as the tissues). Iron atoms exist as Fe2+ within the hemoglobin molecules. When oxygen is added to those atoms, they bind to the iron and this prevents the oxygen from leaving it. Oxygen only leaves the iron when it reaches the tissues. So basically you need iron to carry oxygen across the body, because iron (in hemogloobin) is the oxygen carrier. If a person have a high oxygen requirement at the tissues (such as an athlete), then the body looks to produce more red blood cells (within which the hemoglobin recides) so that it can increase the overall oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. So in order to do that, the body needs needs more iron. So atheletes needs to take more iron because RBCs die after their life span of 120 days. So there is a constant rate of RBC production and killing of them. And then there is iron loss from body in various forms. The body has a store of iron (in liver). So if there is not enough supply of iron (as in pure vegetarians who does not take proper amount of green leafy vegetables), then the body will start utilising those iron stores. When the stores are over, then the body will start exhibiting symptoms of  . In order to solve that deficiency, various iron preparations can be prescribed, and Iron tablets are only one of them.  So as I had described, athletes may need a higher iron supply than normal people. In addition to that, there are other people too, who need higher iron input in their diet: If there is a need to supplement, that can be done using the iron preparations I was talking about. Out of all ingested iron, at most 10-20% is only absorbed. However, the beauty of the human   is that it is strongly regulated. Body will only absorb iron if it is needed. If there is adequate iron in the body already, then the absorption mechanisms are downregulated. However, in overdose, these   and hence there will be over absorption. This occurs more commonly in pediatric age groups who accidentally consumes excess of iron tablets. In those patients the iron gets accumulated in blood (and not in the RBCs are hemoglobin) and harms the cells by various ways. The only way for body to get rid of excess iron is by loss of red blood cells. Hence iron supplementation has to be a carefully monitored procedure.   Hence iron is an absolute necessity in carrying oxygen around in the body. 	2015-04-13 09:21:00Z	Rana Prathap	11

There is a medical doctor, Mark Crislip, who wrote a post about this on  , and I'll cite here the most pertinent lines. Even though he takes a very one-sided position, I personally find his writing convincing, and the whole article is worth reading. It makes many more points I'm leaving out here.  The article then goes on to cite several studies which found that being constantly subject to inflammatory response has several ill effects on health.  He does admit that you need to be otherwise healthy (by following what he calls "kindergarten advice" of eating healthy, getting enough sleep and exercise) to have an immune system working at its baseline. So maybe you could say that, if your immune system is running at reduced "strength" due to increased stress, you could "boost" it by reducing your stressors. But this does not mean that, if you are stressed and consume probiotics or other presumably boosting products, you'll somehow get to the baseline. Also, I share Crislip's view here: it would be misleading to call it boosting when it's simply being returned to its standard state.  There is another possible meaning of "boost the immune system" which does have a basis in fact. If you get a vaccine against a certain disease, you are not exposed to a constant inflammatory response, but you will be able to fight off this one disease better. I was not going to post it here, as this is not the sense usually meant in marketing materials. But the first tip in the first link you gave said "get a flu vaccine", so I thought it's worth mentioning.

474	524	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/524	Sleep is very important for our health and lack of sleep can affect our whole immune system. That's because our body's biological clock is set for 24-hour rhythm and certain periods of light and darkness ( ), and when it's thrown off, so is the immune system.  Regular poor sleep or prolonged lack of sleep can disrupt your body's natural immune system and can lead to many illnesses such as infections (such as cold/flu ) and increasing risk of serious medical conditions such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes as well as it can shortens your life expectancy. So every time when you catch cold and flu, you could blame your bedtime. Therefore when planning your activities and rest, you should consider around 8 hours of good quality sleep a night to function properly (some of us need more or less time). If you have a disturbed sleep patterns you can have [a power nap] during the day when you get tired, it helps a lot. The benefits of napping could be best obtained by training the body and mind to awaken after a short nap. Naps of fewer than 30 minutes restore wakefulness and promotes performance and learning . See also: Stress uses a lot of energy and introducing relaxing activities into your day can improve your energy. This can include deep muscle relaxation, physical exercises (yoga, tai chi or vigorous physical activity at gym), relaxed breathing (yoga, medication), spa, listen to music or sound effects, spending some time with friends and anything else that relaxes you. Relaxation can help you to relieve symptoms of stress and calm you down See:   at NHS Our immune system requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals, and food energy in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.  Foods rich in certain fatty acids (such as  , catalpic acid, eleostearic acid and  ) may boost your healthy immune system by providing additional energy. The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed is also important so intake isn't too much ( ) or too less ( ). Regular drinking can affect your immune system and heavy drinkers tend to catch more infectious diseases. If you cut down on alcohol before bedtime, you'll get a better night's rest and have more energy next day. See: If you find that not consuming caffeine gives you headaches, you should cut down on the amount of caffeine. The Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends that anyone feeling tired should cut out caffeine.

The most notorious is the leaf of the E. coca tree, which contains cocaine. Another stimulating herb more recently banned is Catha edulis (Khat) which contains cathinone. The chemically similar stimulant ephedrine is the active constituent of Ephedra sinica (Mormon Tea), which has had sales restricted in recent years. Ephedra is used instead of black tea (Camellia sinensis) by Mormons because of their restriction against consuming caffeine. Psychedelics like mecsaline found in the common San Pedro cactus (Trichocereus pachanoi), or ibogaine in Tabernanthe iboga, tend to be stimulating at doses below the psychedelic dose but are technically illegal to make tea from. Stimulating herbs which have been legally ignored tend to have unwanted side effects, at least in comparison with caffeine. The bark of Pausinystalia yohimbe contains the adrenergic stimulant yohimbine, commonly marketed as a sex enhancer. Herbs like Nux vomica, which contains the convulsive stimulant strychnine, is certainly available, especially as rat poison. Species containing ketones like camphor (Cinnamomum camphora) and thujone (Artemisia absinthium - the key ingredient wormwood used in absinthe) are said to be toxic but stimulating.

What is basically happening is the motion you sense with your inner ear is different from the motion you are visualizing. This is easily caused by motions that you sense with your body that you can't see with your eyes or that you can't anticipate. This is most common in cars when people are doing other activity while riding in them such as readying a book or playing on an electronic device. It is generally not an issue for the driver since they are in control and able to anticipate everything. As to your question the there really isn't any difference in the motion of an automatic car and a manual car as when driven properly there will be no noticeable changes in motion when shifting gears. I would chalk that site up to an advertisement for selling cars with an automatic transmission as it just seems to talk about how an automatic transmission is better then a manual.  If you look around online you will find claims that both an automatic and a manual are better for preventing carsickness.

The   was conducted in 1973, where they fed sugar in 100g doses to people and measured the effect on phagocytosis (where immune cells engulf invader bacteria to destroy it). The end result was that sugar intake did appear to suppress the ability of the immune system to destroy invading bacteria. This function was suppressed for up to 5 hours in control subjects, while fasting comparisons did not have the same effect. Additionally, they counted the number of neutrophils (type of white blood cells), and they were not diminished, which suggests it was a function blocking mechanism, not that it suppressed the number. So it does limit the effectiveness, but this is not really a suppression of the system. Part of this may be due to the sugar molecule being structurally similar to Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid), and that it competes for the space and prevents the cells from effectively using Vitamin C to destroy bacteria. (Based off studies Linus Pauling did, but I could not find the study, merely references to it). There are suggestions that sugar also  , and that it may  , but these either state more study is needed or are in the incidence of specific other deficiencies (Such as magnesium).	2015-04-12 14:30:12Z	JohnP	7

This would cause significant pain and swelling at the base of the thumb in the "web space" between thumb and index finger.   As you can see in the picture on the right, the UCL appears partially torn. If it does not heal completely, it can result in an insufficiency of that ligament. In this case, the condition not uncommonly becomes chronic because of repeated injury to the already weakened UCL. It causes varying degrees of instability of that joint with pain and weakness of the pincer grasp (imagine squeezing an m&m between your thumb and your index finger.) Initial treatment to optimize ligament healing is immobilization. What can you do now? If you think you re-injured it, you can apply a cold pack (e.g. a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a dry washcloth) to the thumb as tolerated for ~20 minutes, up to four times per day.  Immobilizing the thumb with a bulky, loose ACE wrap or a commercially available thumb brace in the neutral position will help lessen the pain.
You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief if you have no contraindications*. The best thing you can do is see a doctor (perhaps an orthopedist or a hand specialist would be wise), since chronic pain and instability of the thumb is not insignificant. They can do a thorough evaluation of your thumb
and either splint/cast your thumb, give you rehabilitative exercises to help you strengthen your thumb, or recommend surgery if necessary. *

For me as a medical professional   means something like you tripped and your thumb overextended agains ground or you got your thumb crushed in someting. Acute or chronic tendinitis or tendinopathy is usullay assocciated to something repetitive and long lasting movements.  Therefore if you really   your thenar area I would make sure there is not any ligament tears present in your thumb. For example a rupture of ulnar collateral ligamenti of thumb, ie. gamekeeper's thumb or skiier's thumb is quite common injury which, if unsuccesfully treated initially, requires surgical repair later to "re-heal". Base of thumb is quite vague term, if your pain and clicking is near first metacarpophalangeal joint, I would be conserned about this injury. If your symptoms are present more proximally injury of carpar ligaments may be present still and those should be ruled out. Clicking is a symptom which usually originates from anatomical reasons, for example a torn supportive ligaments which predisposes to tendon subluxations.  However if you meant that   is something repetitive and long standing you may indeed have chronic tenditis in some tendon responsible for thumb extension or adduction.  Chronic tenditinis can be really disturbing condition. Curative treatment is hard to obtain and really the only help is immobilisation, avoidance of aggrevating movements and repeated courses of NSAIDs. Bascially I would recommend ANYTHING which even one person have found helpful for chronic wrist or thumb tendinitis.  Chronic tendinitis is also really unsatisfactory for medical professionals since there is so little one can do for the patient, especially if he/she can´t change the working enviroment. In some cases if the condition really persists for a long some kind of tendon surgery may be helpful but results are very controversial.	2015-04-12 14:39:18Z	arkiaamu	-1
456	477	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/477	: No, food cooked via a microwave oven is generally not less healthy than food cooked by other methods.  In general, cooking by any method destroys or reduces nutrient value . This is due to a number of factors: (It's not even always a loss: some nutrients are   available after cooking, because heat breaks down thick cell walls that our digestive system has trouble with, which means that the nutrients are easier for our bodies to uptake .) Each cooking method has a   of the above factors, and so has different effects on nutrients in food. Microwave cooking has the advantage of not cooking in water, and being able to reach a higher heat in a shorter time. Depending on the food, this means that microwaving is sometimes   at preserving nutrients. For example, boiling spinach causes a much higher loss (77% vs. almost none) of   compared to microwaving . Of course, when people make claims about microwaved food being less healthy, they are   referring to a fear that the act of microwave heating ( ) is 'unnatural' in some way, or is subjecting the food to dangerous radiation (which may then be ingested). This is simply not supported  by scientific literature, which indicates that microwave ovens, when used properly, are safe and effective -- with  : In conclusion, microwaving food is a safe alternative to cooking via other methods . Any cooking method will decrease the nutritional value of food, but this is usually an acceptable tradeoff because of the benefits gained from cooking . Microwaves do not cause food to be radioactive or acutely dangerous in any way. : 1:   - SFGate 2:   - HowStuffWorks 3:   - Scientific American 4:   - New York Times 5:   - European Food Information Council 6:   - Centers for Disease Control 7:   - Quan R, Yang C, Rubinstein S, Lewiston NJ, Sunshine P, Stevenson DK, Kerner JA Jr. Pediatrics. 1992 Apr;89(4 Pt 1):667-9. 8:   - Wikipedia 9:   - U.S. Food and Drug Administration	2015-04-12 21:06:41Z	Nate Barbettini	23
456	460	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/460	Heat in a microwave oven is generated by the rotation of water molecules by bombarding them with electromagnetic radiation in the microwave spectrum (non-ionizing electromagnetic waves between common radio waves and infrared frequencies) causing polarized molecules in the food to rotate or collide and subsequently thermal energy is built up ( ). One 1998 study shown that microwaving food can lead to faster breakdown of vitamin B . This is because microwaved food can get locally hotter than the boiling point of water (100°C/212°F). Another   show a general decrease in the levels of all the studied compounds except for mineral nutrients which were stable under all cooking conditions: So it seems that the most heat-sensitive nutrients such as folic acid, vitamins B and C (mainly water-soluble vitamins)are the most affected when microwaving food. One study published in The Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture in 2003 found that microwave cooking destroyed more flavonoids than other methods. When steamed or cooked without water, the broccoli retained most of its nutrients and antioxidants. Loss of flavonoids in Broccoli Study: According to Dr Cristina García-Viguera, leader of the study: However other studies didn't show a high loss of nutrients with microwave cooking, in fact two studies indicate that microwave cooking helps retain flavonoids better than other methods. Loss of flavonoids from Tomatoes: Loss of flavonoids from Potatoes: To minimize phenolic losses in potatoes, microwaving should be done at 500W . Study at Cornell University showed that spinach retains nearly all its folate when cooked in a microwave . Study at Cornell University found that bacon cooked by microwave has significantly lower levels of cancer-causing nitrosamines than conventionally cooked bacon . Acrylamide is considered a potential occupational carcinogen by U.S. government agencies  and it can be found in starchy foods, such as potato chips/crisps, French fries and bread that had been heated higher than 120°C (248°F) . Acrylamide levels appear to rise as food is heated for longer periods of time. Unlike frying and baking, based on FDA studies , microwaving whole potatoes with skin on to make “microwaved baked potatoes” does not produce acrylamide, although unlike deep-frying, it has limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels . However acrylamide can been found in other microwaved products such as popcorn. Microwave ovens are frequently used for reheating leftover food, and bacterial contamination may not be repressed if the safe temperature is not reached, resulting in  . The radiation produced by a microwave oven is non-ionizing (in comparison to X-rays and high-energy particles which are associated with the cancer risks). Long-term studies to assess cancer risk have so far failed to identify any carcinogenicity microwave radiation (2.45GHz) even with chronic exposure levels . However, with the oven door open, the radiation may cause damage by heating, although the modern design of microwave ovens is equipped with safety switches that turn off the radiation when the door is open and ovens are sufficiently insulated to allow only "minimal leakage" when the oven is working. Any form of cooking will destroy vitamins and other nutrients in food, but it depends how much water is used in the cooking, how long the food is cooked and at what temperature . However comparative cooking method studies generally find that, if properly used, microwave cooking does not affect the nutrient content of foods to a larger extent than conventional heating .

The condition you’re referring to is known as Congenital   (BAV). It is the most common congenital heart valve abnormality, present in 1-2% of live births. Normally there are three leaflets (a.k.a. cusps) comprising the aortic valve. BAV refers to the situation when there are only two cusps, a hemodynamically less favorable scenario.  Although generally benign in itself, BAV has been associated with an increased risk of several serious complications. In particular,  , a condition in which the blood flow exiting the heart is limited by a narrowed valve, is more common in individuals with BAV and often occurs at a younger age. Aortic stenosis in BAV patients is also frequently accompanied by  , back flow through the valve. Both properties reflect the anatomic descriptor you give:  . 
Yes. This can be demonstrated by looking at familial clustering of the condition.  , the researchers started with thirty patients diagnosed by echocardiography with congenital BAV.* All first-degree relatives were contacted, and 90% of them agreed to undergo echocardiography. Of those, 9% were found to have BAV. This is significantly higher than the baseline population risk (~1%).

There are 3 important causes of aortic valve stenosis: congenitally bicuspid aortic valve, senile calcific aortic stenosis and rheumatic heart disease. In advanced stages of all 3 conditions, the morphology of aortic valve looks equally bad and it may difficult to ascertain the original pathology. Fusion of leaflets may occur in all 3 conditions. Senile degenerative aortic stenosis occurs mostly in the elderly, hence if the age of this patient is advanced, that is a very likely possibility and that condition is not familial or hereditary. Rheumatic heart disease is common in developing parts of the world and is most commonly associated with involvement of mitral valve also. Isolated aortic involvement is much less common in rheumatic heart disease.  Not all patients with bicuspid aortic valve will progress to narrowing or regurgitation. Stenosis/regurgiation may occur after many years or may not occur at all. Also, milder degrees of valve dysfunction do not cause any symptoms and do not need surgery.  Hope this helps.

418	422	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/422	Mostly it depends on the cause of the pneumonia.  Pneumonia is the name for infection or inflammation of the lungs. It can be primary or secondary. A good example of the difference is pneumonia caused by the influenza virus. Influenza affects the lungs directly. That's a primary pneumonia, and yes, this is contagious, as the air one coughs out contains droplets carrying the virus. Pneumonia caused by viruses is more common in children and young adults (except for influenza, which affects all age groups), and is therefore contagious to people who have never been exposed to the virus - usually other children/young adults. In general, primary pneumonia tends to be more contagious, and besides viruses, it can be caused by mycoplasma and tuberculosis. These are contagious. The damage done by the influenza virus in the lungs leaves the person susceptible to attack by bacteria that would not normally gain a foothold in the lung. This is secondary pneumonia, and because   lungs are not damaged - and you already have the same bacteria in your mouth and throat as someone with secondary pneumonia but are not ill - you are much less likely to get sick from being exposed to bacterial pneumonia than from someone with viral pneumonia. Similarly, pneumonia is more common in smokers with damaged lungs, or in people with some degree of decreased immunocompetence. Alcohol, other drugs, and people with swallowing disorders can aspirate leading to pneumonia; surgery or chest injuries where deep breathing hurts can also lead to pneumonia. These pneumonias aren't likely to be contagious. Finally, some pneumonias are caused by exposure to chemicals. Since there's no infectious agent involved, you can't be affected. There are now vaccines against some of the bacterial pneumonias, so vaccines against influenza and others help. Since you might not know what kind of pneumonia someone has, practicing good hygiene is always a good idea.

But if pneumonia is caused by chemical fumes or other poisons, then it is not contagious. If treatment for pneumonia is administered early on, then the time pneumonia is contagious for is shorter. For example, a person with bacterial pneumonia will stop being contagious within two days of taking antibiotics. For other types of pneumonia – like the one that can cause tuberculosis – the treatment may have to be administered for at least two weeks before a person is no longer contagious. On the other hand, individuals with viral pneumonia are less contagious after symptoms have subsided. The key is to reduce your ability to contaminate others by utilizing proper hygiene and avoiding others as best as possible.  can be caused by different types of bacteria, including streptococcal pneumonia (most common in adults), chlamydophila pneumonia, and H. influenza type B pneumonia (most common in children). The common signs and symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include high fever, cough with phlegm, chills, chest pain when breathing or coughing, rapid breathing, shortness of breath, and loss of appetite. Bacterial pneumonia is very contagious, so beginning antibiotic treatment right away can reduce your contagiousness.  is caused by a virus and commonly affects children. Viral pneumonia may clear up within three weeks, but does increase the risk of bacterial pneumonia. Symptoms of viral pneumonia are similar to the flu with fever, aches, and cough. Symptoms may worsen within the first two days, then proceed to improve. Viral pneumonia is highly contagious and can actually spread quicker than bacterial or fungal pneumonia. There are three subtypes of  : coccidioides, histoplasma, and cryptococcus. If a person with a weakened immune system inhales a fungus that’s how they can become sick. Symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Unlike other types, fungal pneumonia is not contagious, but symptoms may appear worse in those with weaker immune systems. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when a person inhales food or other objects into their lungs. Although not contagious, aspiration pneumonia can be life-threatening, so immediate medical attention is required.  is a milder form of pneumonia that presents symptoms similar to a cold. Those symptoms include low-grade fever, persistent dry cough, fatigue and tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pain, and loss of appetite. Walking pneumonia is less severe than full-blown pneumonia, yet it can still be transmitted through droplet infection. Steering clear of others can help reduce transmission, along with covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. Source: 	2016-07-06 15:34:32Z	Anita Cote	1
417	419	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/419	 - More contagious at the beginning, much less at the end. The "common cold" (or upper respiratory infection) is associated with over 200 different viral types , and many times more than one virus is present. Because of this, there's probably no   specific answer to this question, but it can be answered generally. Rhinovirus-caused colds (which are a large majority of "common" colds) are typically contagious at the beginning, and are much less contagious after a few days . You are most at risk of transmitting the virus to someone else for the 4-5 days after being   yourself  - not necessarily when symptoms appear. In other words, you can definitely be asymptomatic and still contagious. On the other hand, if you still feel symptoms after a week, the chances are much lower that you're actually still contagious.

417	458	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/458	In general, a person first becomes contagious two to three days before their symptoms begin, and they remain contagious until all their symptoms have gone. So most people will be contagious for around two weeks. Symptoms include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, and fever which usually resolve in seven to ten days, with some symptoms lasting up to three weeks as the body fights off the infection. Colds in younger children can last up to two weeks. You should see your GP if your symptoms persist for more than three weeks. Most colds get better on their own without treatment.

However, some countries are still uncertain about this, and have requested companies move their towers away from people by at least 100 meters. An Italian court even acknowledged a "causal" link:
 
but this has been deeply criticized by public health leaders in places like the US. For the most part, there hasn't been substantial evidence to say that the towers cause harm to humans more than 100 meters away. Particularly in the case of short-distance exposure, there hasn't been much data because many times base stations are not turned off during maintenance, but the power being sent through to the antennas is cut off, so that the workers do not have to work near live antennas, but a study over around 50 years of people exposed to Radio Frequency (RF) waves indicates no significant negative consequences. In the conclusion the author notes a well-worded disclaimer: Comes from the following article (same one, two different links):
 
 There have been studies done on animals with respect to RF exposure with possible consequences that you can read about on wikipedia:

410	413	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/413	Overall, there has been inconsistent data on the effects of using zinc lozenges to treat the common cold. Most studies have also been done on children, which may lead to more uncertainty about its effects on adults, but some of the studies I will mention have been tested on adults.  One study showed the effects of using zinc to prevent the common cold in schoolchildren. They found that between the two groups they studied (one took zine sulfate tablets, the other placebos) that the zinc-supplemented group had less of a chance of getting the cold. They concluded that zinc supplements have a beneficial effect on children. Another study (done by the same researchers as the second study I linked to) tested the effects of zinc lozenges on treating cold symptoms. They found that taking zinc lozenges within 24 hours of first getting cold symptoms may reduce the length of the cold. They do not give any firm recommendation though, because of insufficient data. They also mention the same side-effects as above.  This study is also backed up by other similar study which found that zinc lozenges reduced the duration of colds by about 7 days, again with only minor side effects such as bad taste and mouth irritation.  Other similar reports' results showed that zinc lozenges not only reduce the duration of colds, but also the severity. Some studies say that zinc lozenges do not have any noteworthy therapeutic effect in treating the common cold. No studies have provided sufficient information to prove or disprove beneficial effects of taking zinc lozenges to prevent and treat the common cold. The consumption of zinc lozenges doesn't present any dangerous or deadly effects, unless you consider bad taste and nausea deadly. As of now, experts recommend talking to your doctor to decide if taking zinc 
lozenges is right for you. Well first, as I said above, there is no conclusive evidence. There is also no definite best type of zinc lozenge to take. Of the studies that showed positive results, zinc gluconate was used the most, but zinc sulfate and zinc acetate were also shown to be effective. Of the trials that showed no noteworthy effect, zinc gluconate was also the most tested type, but zinc acetate also showed no effect. According to  , researchers are still trying to figure out which type of zinc lozenge is the best. Taking zinc lozenges hasn't been shown to produce any major side-effects. Sometimes, people taking them may experience bad taste in their mouth and possibly nausea. Nasal spray, as you mentioned is also not good.

406	409	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/409	The quoted "1-2" pounds per week (or approximately 0.5 - 1 kilo) is based on the traditional 3500 calories burned = 1 pound of fat. Now, while the exact figure of 3500 calories is somewhat open to debate, that is the rationale. 500 calories a day = 1 pound of loss per week. The problem with crash dieting is twofold. One, the majority of the weight lost is water weight, and will rapidly return once the person hydrates themselves. The second problem is that in an effort to lose large amounts of weight in a short time is that people will essentially starve themselves, and possibly do so while adding in exercise. In the very short term, this may not pose any problems for a healthy person, but if the dieter is compromised in any way health wise, or the practice is continued for a longer period then nutrient deficiencies can start arising, which can introduce a long litany of health problems. Another problem is that people that lose large amounts of weight in a short time tend to binge eat once the diet period is over, and regain most if not all the weight. Many even end up weighing more than they did before they did the extreme dieting. There have been studies comparing many of the popular diets such as Atkins, South Beach, China Study, Paleo, and on and on. They have all shown that weight loss is a simple factor of calorie reduction. Eat less calories than you expend, and you will lose weight. Period. (And "starvation mode" is a myth.) When you first start dieting, you may lose more than the 1-2 pounds a week, which is normal. After a bit, your body will readjust and the weight loss will slow down, however if you maintain the calorie deficit, you will eventually lose the weight.

That isn't to say it isn't real or valid, but it covers outcomes from a great many different studies. In drug trials, the effects of a drug are often compared to a placebo - a sugar pill/saline injection - even placebo  .

The key points here are:	2015-04-08 08:08:09Z	Tom Medley	5
384	494	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/494	The placebo effect is a very interesting thing to study. To keep this scientific, though, let's divide your question into three addressable points: If each of these points can be resolved as true, then it would be fair to call the question answered. Also, at the bottom you'll find some suggestions for a placebo self-test. A placebo is a treatment that looks like a regular treatment, but is actually an inactive look-alike, and not a medicine. Placebos are used in medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, as often some of the benefit from a treatment will actually be due to the placebo effect. In a controlled trial, some trial subjects are given the treatment being tested, and some are given placebos. Ideally, the subjects can't tell the difference, and at the end of the study, the effectiveness of the drug can be compared to that of the placebo. In practice, this often means sugar or cornstarch pills, but can extend to other treatments as well. In fact, even surgical procedures can be placebos. Known as sham surgeries, surgical placebos often involve the administration of anesthesia followed by several incisions similar to those that would be made during typical surgery. What is the placebo effect that makes all of this necessary? The placebo effect is the improvement in a medical condition resulting from the   that one is being treated, rather than the effectiveness of the treatment itself.  Because patients tend to believe they are being given an effective treatment, this belief itself contributes to improvement in condition. A number of examples can be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the placebo effect. Several of them conclude that not only is the placebo effect powerful, it is sometimes more powerful than the medication alternatives. A migraine study conducted in 2014 compared the effect of the migraine treatment rizatriptan (sold by Merck Pharmaceuticals as Maxalt) to a placebo, by administering envelopes with drugs in them to migraine sufferers. The subjects were instructed to take the medication in case of migraine. The envelopes came in pairs labeled 'Placebo', 'Maxalt' or 'Placebo or Maxalt', however, each pair actually had one placebo envelope and one Maxalt envelope. Yet, subjects reported the same level of pain relief from placebo labeled Maxalt as from Maxalt labeled placebo, suggesting that placebos are sometimes as effective as actual medication. Patients also reported pain relief from the placebo labeled placebo, suggesting that even one who knowingly takes a placebo can still be subject to the effect. A study specifically designed to evaluate the placebo effect compared fake acupuncture to fake pills, a comparison of two placebos. Subjects suffering from arm pain were either prescribed acupuncture or pain medication, but the pain medication was cornstarch pills, and the acupuncture used needles with tips that retract into themselves upon touching skin, like stage knives. The subjects were warned about possible side effects of the treatment, with the side effects mentioned taken from actual side effects of either real treatment. Interestingly, one third of patients reported the exact side effects they were warned about, including excessive drowsiness in the pill group, and redness and inflammation in the acupuncture group, even though the skin wasn't actually pierced. Some patients in both groups reported extreme pain, but more interestingly, most of the subjects reported extreme pain relief. An effective method of proving widespread viability of the placebo effect is showcasing its virality, quite literally. When one believes he is sick, and starts developing actual symptoms as a result, the medical community refers to this condition as 'psychogenic illness,' or actual illness spawned from the belief of illness. When this believed illness is believed to be contagious, anyone who hears about it can himself become ill, experiencing the full range of purported symptoms. This is known as 'sociogenic illness', and it is potentially the most infectious category of illness in existence. This is because it "infects" through information, making mass media often the single greatest transmission vector. Most worryingly, the current medical opinion is that there is no particular predisposition to mass sociogenic illness and it is a behavioral condition that anyone can show in the right circumstances. A 2006 study testing individual sensitivity to GSM cellphone signals found no evidence that people with self-reported sensitivity to mobile phone signals are able to detect such signals or that they react to them with increased symptom severity. As sham exposure was sufficient to trigger severe symptoms in some participants, this condition was most likely sociogenic illness. A 2012 study testing whether media coverage of people sensitive to WiFi signal contributed to reports of WiFi sensitivity concluded that media reports about the adverse effects of supposedly hazardous substances can increase the likelihood of experiencing symptoms following sham exposure and developing an apparent sensitivity to it. A case study about mass illness attributed to toxic exposure at a high school had features of mass psychogenic illness. Notably, widespread subjective symptoms thought to be associated with environmental exposure to a toxic substance persisted in the absence of objective evidence of an environmental cause. In other words, sociogenic and psychogenic illness exist, there is no particular predisposition to mass sociogenic illness and it is a behavioral condition that anyone can show in the right circumstances. All of the previous studies seem to indicate that yes, the placebo effect can be scientifically tested, but as a final confirmation, a study conducted on subjects with Alzheimer's disease showed that these subjects got less pain relief from pain medications. They required higher doses, possibly because they had forgotten that they were getting the drugs, or they forgot that the pain medicines had worked for them before. In other words, Alzheimer's disease seems to allow the comparison of placebo effect and the lack thereof. Because Alzheimer's disease patients do not remember taking their medication, they receive far less benefit from it due to the lost contributions from the placebo effect. Now that we've scientifically proven that the placebo effect works, it is powerful, and it by all means should work for you, even if you know you are or may be taking a placebo, we may devise some methods. You will likely need an external source of entropy, and should most likely not use a placebo in place of actual necessary treatment. This would mean that you will want a medication that does not cure any particular disease, though maybe alleviating symptoms is a better bet. I assume that this is why the studies above tend to stick with pain relief for evaluating placebos. Pain relief is easy to judge and quantify on a personal level, and the lack thereof does not threaten anyone's life. If you are injured and in pain, there is your test. If you are not injured, however, and have no desire to be,  you may want to try medication that causes noticeable benefit rather than treatment. For example, caffeine. Find two coffees, one caffeinated, one decaffeinated, that you can't tell tell apart with taste alone. Ideally, add something with a strong taste masking ability to each to help prevent differentiation. Have a friend divide up the two coffees into numbered plastic bags, one bag for each day of the experiment, without you knowing which bags are which. Also, it is important to prevent bias that you not be able to connect different days of the experiment, so no evens and odds. Your friend's numbering system should be sufficiently random that you can't figure out which bags are which. When you are ready, begin the experiment, using a bag of your choice for each day of the experiment. Chart, on an hourly basis, the amount of "buzz" you experience from that coffee number, and after maybe a month try to take a guess using the chart at which bag numbers were caffeinated and which were decaffeinated. Then, ask for your friend's table of which were which, and evaluate. This was just a suggestion, but this and similar study designs should by all means allow you to test the placebo effect on yourself. Feel free to experiment, that's how science progresses.	2015-04-13 17:09:53Z	TheEnvironmentalist	4

These are: Each of these takes various factors such as age, lean body mass, sex into account in varying emphases to come up with a basal, or resting metabolic rate. This rate is basically how many calories you would need on a daily basis to simply breathe in and out all day long. If you run through all of them and then average, you should come pretty close to your basic needs. There are many calculators already programmed on the internet with these formulas, or you can get them  . Once you have that, then you can take a look at the various sites on the internet that have calorie expenditures for various activities such as housework, office work, weightlifting, running, really just about any activity. Most of these are again approximations, the best charts will account for height/weight/age/sex. Add those to your BMR, and you should be pretty close to a daily intake need. Really, though, all you need to do is track your weight. Take note of any long term trends on the scale, and if you are gaining weight, cut back on calorie intake or food makeup (healthier vs. unhealthy). If you are losing too much weight, eat more. Don't be alarmed by daily fluctuations, you can vary quite a bit during a day. Best bet is to weigh yourself under the same conditions daily. If you are lucky enough to have a college lab or similar that supports general testing for the public (You can occasionally get in on a kinesiology class testing phase where they need subjects), you can get exhaled gas analysis, and this can give you a very close estimate of calories burned during a specific activity.

380	94	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/94	There are a few considerations when looking at a healthy lacto-ovo vegetarian diet. This is fairly easy in this type of diet, as eggs contain complete proteins. There are also a few plant sources (such as quinoa, buckwheat and hempseed) that contain either a complete protein profile or the 9 essential amino acids in good amounts. Hempseed also contains Omega-3 fatty acids which can be difficult to get without seafood. One of the main reasons for healthy fats in the diet is for the proper transport of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) into the body. Nuts and avocados are examples of healthy fats, as are olives and olive oils. If possible, for olive oils get extra virgin and as fresh as possible, as this will ensure the highest levels of polyphenols. Along with the basic considerations, you need to be aware of possible deficiencies due to age, sex, things of this nature. For example,   suggests that B-12 deficiency can be a problem in pregnant lacto-ovo vegetarians.

The   is why people are  . So from a social perspective, DaveL's recommendations are also helpful if you want others to   you're   not to get them infected, but in reality some people will know you should have stayed home because many people around you   get infected  (but most importantly, you should stay home to get better).   You need to know why you have this "common cold" symptoms, so your treatment is adequate for just having a common cold or something a bit more serious or a lot more dangerous, many illnesses display symptoms of the common cold (e.g. the flu, but the list is big). In the mean time and while you get properly diagnosed, IMHO any disease that has the potential to be airborne infectious can be somewhat mitigated and contained following the procedures, precautions and advice given by CDC to contain and deal with the flu. So I will elaborate on that particular case (again, I can't stress this enough,  , this answer should only broaden your general sense of how to avoid contagion for you and for others to some degree). You don't   attend anything that's not critical, attend your health and well being, that is critical. Staying home will dramatically reduce the amount of possible subjects to be infected, in this case your family, so stay home and follow all hygienic recommendations.

Firstly, smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriages. It can also cause premature birth, which can lead to many health complications, such as low weight, feeding difficulties, and breathing problems. A mother who smokes while pregnant is also twice as likely to have abnormal bleeding during both pregnancy and delivery. This is dangerous for both the birth mother and the baby. Smoking can also cause some birth defects and puts the baby at a higher risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The child also has a higher chance of having Cerebral Palsy (CP). When a child of a mother who smoked during pregnancy grows older, they might have lung and brain damage as they grow older. If a mother is exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy, there is still a risk of many of the complications stated above. So, whether you are a pregnant mother or the husband of one or anyone else living or spending a lot of time with a pregnant mother, don't smoke.  Also see 	2015-04-06 14:24:45Z	Community	9

When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through   to a baby and can stunt fetal growth, facial deformities, damage neurons and brain structures which can result in intellectual disability and also cause other physical damage. A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop fully and doesn't mature until the latter stages of pregnancy, so cannot process alcohol. So if you drink at any time during your pregnancy, the alcohol can affect your baby.

357	361	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/361	This has been a controversial dispute for a long time and it can involve a lot of personal opinion, but I will try to answer this as scientifically as possible. There hasn't been any viable evidence that vaccines do cause autism. Several different theories have been proposed on why vaccines could cause autism, such as the ingredient in some vaccines thimerosal being harmful, but these have all been disproved by many different experiments. Many reliable sources such as the   says that there is no link between autism an vaccines. A   from the Institute of Medicine that tested 8 different vaccines on both adults and children showed that the vaccines are very safe. The CDC has also funded many other studies on vaccine ingredients and their links to autism, especially  , a mercury-based ingredient used in some vaccines. These studies have shown "no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and ASD in children."  These are pretty convincing, but you can't just rely on one source, right?   also shows how even though there have been many claims that vaccines do cause autism, there aren't any studies that help support this claim.   found that even though there was an increase in cases of autism, there was no jump in the amount of cases when the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, another controversial vaccine, was introduced in 1988. , Georgia compared the ages that the MMR vaccine was given in children with autism against the age that children without autism received it. The results were that the proportion of time that children were vaccinated in both control groups was similar.  The Oxford Journal entry mentioned many other studies that tested the link between MMR vaccines and autism and there has been no plausible evidence. The other vaccine ingredient that is also said to cause autism is thimerosal, which I mentioned before. The Oxford Journal issue also shows studies about this link.  helped show that there wasn't a link between thimerosal and autism. In fact, cases of autism increased in 1992 after thimerosal-containing vaccines were discontinued.   also disproved the theory that thimerosal causes autism. They actually found that thimerosal-containing vaccines might even have a beneficial effect in children. There have also been many other studies that invalidate the link between thimerosal and autism.  One last theory that has been proposed is that multiple vaccines being administered to a child simultaneously can weaken their immune system and cause autism. This theory is flawed for several reasons.  used data from many studies and found that vaccines do not overwhelm and weaken an infant's immune system. Infants are able to respond well to the many vaccines that are given to them.  found that vaccines did not weaken the immune system to any diseases. They were unable to find consistent relationship between infectious diseases and immunization. All of this scientific evidence leaves one question left to be answered.   (this part will get some more opinion then you may like, but it is necessary)  was one of the main reasons that this controversy over vaccines and autism began. It claimed that the MMR vaccine caused developmental problems and other autism symptoms. This study has now been retracted as it was shown to be incorrect.  also talks about why there are still some people that believe that vaccines are the cause of autism. It seems most people who claim that vaccines cause autism are just looking for something to blame for what is happening to children. Many parents may become angry when they find out their child has autism, and they put that anger against vaccines.  There are some logical arguments that people may present, such as changing of their child's behavior after receiving vaccines. This is mostly coincidence, as most children are vaccinated around the same time autism symptoms begin to appear (usually 12-18 months) . Other than this and some of the arguments mentioned earlier, there is almost no reason to believe that vaccines cause autism.	2015-04-06 06:45:51Z	michaelpri	47
357	565	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/565	You have already gotten an excellent answer on the scientific evidence for the autism-vaccination link (namely, that there isn't one). I would however like to address this part of your question directly, as an academic epidemiologist: No. It is a relatively common tactic in the various denial communities (vaccines, HIV, climate change, etc.) to posit that a major conspiracy exists to hide the truth, and thus explain away the utter lack of evidence for their position. But one should consider what that kind of conspiracy would actually entail. First, a number of researchers into vaccine safety are   paid by pharmaceutical companies. Which means they don't particularly have any financial incentive to play along. Second, some of the scientific evidence for the lack of a link between autism and vaccines emerges from birth cohorts in countries with a national health registry,  . The authors report no pharmaceutical funding (nor would they need it for a registry study), so for this study a conspiracy would not only have to involve researchers who are not compensated, but the suborning of an entire national health registry. Finally, even absent financial incentives, a conspiracy to hide the truth is actively counter to the incentives that researchers   have. Null results, like "nope, vaccines still not associated with autism..." are not exactly amazing results. Controversial ideas that turn out to be true, like the link between HPV and cancer, even if they're an uphill battle, win people  . Actually figuring out the causal mechanism of autism? That's a potentially career changing result. Getting an entire   and the healthcare systems of entire countries to take a pass in favor of pharmaceutical profits that those researchers don't get a share in? That's well outside the realm of possibility.	2015-04-18 21:33:58Z	Fomite	22

With your skin, it's actually better if you use it every day, at least on areas where you get eczema. Eczema (or Atopic Dermatitis) is an incompletely understood skin disorder, in which the normal skin barrier function (permeability) is compromised, allowing the skin to dry out more than normal skin. The cause of the dryness in AD is thought by some to be a deficiency of a naturally occurring fatty substance in the skin called  . Others believe it's an abnormal or missing protein which causes the skin barrier to be compromised, allowing allergens and irritants to cause immune responses more easily, triggering the itch/chronic inflammation (this might explain the response seen with topical steroids).  Whatever the case may be, moisturizers do provide a barrier of some type to the skin and help to decrease transepidermal water loss; therefore they are highly recommended for AD. Not using moisturizer will leave you open to more problematic eczema. Your skin will not make enough protective lipids regardless of whether you use moisturizer or not. You should use it every day, at least on areas where you get eczema. Other things which help Atopic Dermatitis involve water temperature when bathing (the cooler, the better), patting your skin dry instead of vigorous rubbing, applying the moisturizer immediately after bathing when your skin has already been moistened by the water, getting a reasonable amount of sun on affected areas, avoiding wool and heavy clothing that might make you sweat, using "gentle" soaps (only soaping up areas that need cleaning), showering briefly twice a day instead of once (applying moisturizer afterwards!) etc. There are some new ceramide-based moisturizers that have been shown to be helpful in AD. Some are very expensive while others are more reasonably priced. Some dermatologists have recommended  . You can spot test it (one arm or one affected area) to save money while evaluating how well it works for you. Determining what kinds of moisturizers work best for you involves trial and error, but whatever works, from petrolatum or Aquaphor, coconut oil (frectionated coconut oil and Johoba oil absorb into the skin a bit better so are less greasy), or another type, don't be hesitant to use it.

There are many physiological factors having influence to sleeping of which circadian rhytm is one of the most important. Messing with your circadian rhytm would take guru's strength of mind. In a population level I would say it is not possible. I have two aspects for this. 1) In year 2015 we are able to teleport photons and each person on Earth carries thousands times more sophisticated computer chips in their pockets than it took to land on Moon. However we still dont know exactly WHY we have to sleep. Of course there is increasing knowledge regarding those physiological activies which happen during sleep but the very basic reason for sleep is unknown. As so, in my opinion we should thoroughly establish the very basic ideology in sleep in order to reduce itś duration from the average 7-8 hours a day 2) Millions of years of evolution has brought us here. Some few ten thousands of years ago it was dangerous to sleep. You had to minimize your sleep time since all that time you were vulnerable to your fellow primitive humans and wild animals. Whether humans slept less in those days or not, I can´t say. However is not influecing today's humans when obviously we are living quite different times. But I think that if it was possible to reduce sleep hours from 7-8 to, say, 4-5 hours a day this ability would have developed during evolution. This ability may also have diminished during evolution, but again that would have happened due to changing enviroment we are living and reduced sleep for modern human would be nearly impossible in population level. Of course if we are looking from individual level, sure it could be possible to sleep less. You can start reducing your sleeping time and see the effects. Some of us can run 100m in less than 9.80 seconds, someone can run a marathon in less than 2:10 and someone can benchpress over 300kgs.

344	349	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/349	I am sensing some mix up here.  Your are asking about artificial tendons but your quote is stating about joint replacements. Basically your equating apples and oranges. Joint replacements or joint arthroplasties are used to treat severely destructed joints. In four cases of five the reason for joint destruction is osteoarthrosis in which the joint cartilage has worn off resulting to pure bone to bone contact which is very painful and disabling.  During joint replacement surgery the severely damages joint surfaces are sawed off and they are replaced with identically shaped components. These component usually have two options for fixation. They can be cemented, in which polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is put in both components. Then components is compressed to molded end of the bone and cement penetrates to porous bone tissue. The better and deeper the cement penetration, the firmer is the fixation. Another option is to use hydroxyaphatite (HA) coated components. Component is again compressed against bone, but the fixation is achieved by bone ingrowth to to HA coating. Bearing material is also important aspect in joint replacements. Knee and hip are by far the most commonly replaced joint. In hips there is usuallu metallic head bearing agains cup made from polyethylene (PE). In knee both komponents are usually metallic but there is an   made from PE between components to reduce friction. Fixation and bearing materials are the weak links in joint replacements. Weight lifting or heavy exercises are not recommended in patients with replaced joint. Most importantly wear is always present in each and every joint replacement, current medicine does not know a bearing material which does not wear. Wear of PE correlates with use. The more you put weight or strain to your hip/knee replacement the more it wears and more likely it will result to complications associated to increased release of PE particle.  Intense repetitive movement in the joint can also cause cement debonding or breakage in the bone-HA interface and to loosening of the components.  Hip or knee are so complex mechanical systems that each and every movement or momentum can not be handled with current knowledge regarding mechanical aspects joint replacements. At this time joint replacements tolerate very well walking, daily activities and light weight training.  Of course nowadays we can use all ceramic or all metallic bearings but I won´t dig in to those. Use of PE is so common and traditional in joint replacements that these restriction quoted by OP are important to >90% of patients. Tour de France winner   for example has all metallic hip replacement. Artificial tendons are another thing. Treatment of ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is very common procedure these days. Most commonly ACL is replaced with autograft. That means a tissue retrieved from another site in the SAME patient.  In ACL reconstruction common site for tendon autograft is hamstring or gracilis tendon graft. This graft is retrieved with special instruments, cut to required length ja then fixed with bioabsorbable screws to femur and tibia. With time the tendon provides perfect ingrowth to the bone since the tendon is retrieved from same patient and there is no issue regarding tissue rejection.  Usually young patient with ACL rupture can return to heavy exercise without any restrictions after successful ACL reconstruction.	2015-04-05 10:42:13Z	Franck Dernoncourt	4

The artificial surfaces of the joint replacement are shaped in such a way as to allow joint movement similar to that of a healthy and natural joint. Sports or occupations requiring repetitive overhead motion or heavy lifting can place a significant strain on rotator cuff muscles and tendons.

343	385	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/385	 - Organic foods don't seem to have a significant difference as of what studies can prove, which is why conventional or organic, people should make sure they're getting the proper nutrients that their bodies need. The first recorded use of insecticides is about 4500 years ago by Sumerians who used sulphur compounds to control insects and mites, whilst about 3200 years ago the Chinese were using mercury and arsenical compounds for controlling body lice. In the 1920s there were even cases of using arsenic, which was replaced by DDT usage until the new chemical was discovered to have severe consequences (harm to   as well as problems with  ). DDT is linked with cancer, endocrine disruption, and reproductive and developmental effects. Over time, people began to switch to organic pesticides to get away from the health scares (or threats) of these synthetic chemicals. To address the question, we should first be clear about what organic means. Organic food covers a wide variety of techniques and different types of foods that all have their own types of legal loop-holes, or possible work-around strategies. There are many pesticides that are naturally produced by plants which farmers use, but that doesn't mean they aren't dangerous. In contrast, just because a pesticide is synthetic doesn't immediately indicate that it's more dangerous than natural products. Some pesticides that are approved by the government may be harmless in small quantities, but when organic producers attempt to refuse these, they may turn to alternatives that are even more dangerous, just to keep the label "organic". In another case, farmers could claim "natural methods are insufficient to address critical issues of production", and then treat their animals with antibiotics while still calling the meat organic. On the other side of this issue, some people argue that the less chemicals we consume in general, the better. Even if they might be government approved, that doesn't prove they're completely non-toxic. The Stanford paper claim that there just isn't enough evidence to prove a significant difference in health benefits/risks. They don't necessarily have more nutrients, decrease the risk of any diseases, or have higher nutritional content except for phosphorus, which most people get enough of anyways. However, the study   suggest organic foods contain less pesticides. The health risks of consuming less pesticides though,  . "Additionally, organic chicken and pork appeared to reduce exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria,  ." It's nearly impossible to give a definitive answer of which tastes better. To pile onto the confusion, it's possible that the taste differences touted by some may simply derive from a  . In response to the scares involved with pesticides in general, people began to research methods to minimize the amount of pesticide used. Basically, DNA from an external source is inserted into a plant so that the plant inherits some desirable traits. This allowed plants to develop natural immunities to certain bacteria and produce more or bigger produce. Over time, people became scared of GMOs as too good to be true. For the most part, scientists agree that GMOs pose no greater risk than conventional food ( ). There are still legitimate concerns about using GMOs, such as allergy development in humans, toxicity levels of naturally produced pesticides in the plant, and   of bacteria, but for the most part these are tested before distribution. Public wariness may be influenced by  Organic farming is good for the environment in the sense that it often leads to less pollution. Pesticides on crops often run-off into streams and rivers, interfering and even hurting local wildlife, but with organic pesticides, the chemicals decompose faster before they can cause massive change to their environment. There may be other potential benefits, but to feed the immense population that exists on earth, many debate whether organic farming is truly sustainable.    How much pesticide is being used? How much exposure becomes a detriment? Does it have long-term consequences? What are the loopholes that producers are using?

Getting your tendon (or any body part for that matter) replaced by an artificial tendon usually takes longer to recover than a tendon repair surgery, and also leaves you with some lifetime limitations, such as not be able to lift weight and you will not be able to compete in sports that involve the tendon that got replaced as actively. Tendon repair surgeries tend to take less time to recover from, and they also have a high success rate (if you do proper therapy).	2015-04-05 03:10:29Z	michaelpri	3

You're young, and have less bone and more cartilage in your nose relative to it's size than adults have. If you find and press the noses of other kids your age, then do so with adults, you'll notice a significant difference between the adults and the kids, though not all of the kids' noses will flatten as much as yours. Though noses are different, in this picture you can see a woman and a young child. Their noses are quite different in length. The baby's would be very compressible. The woman, not so much.  This is a young woman's nose with the underlying structures labeled. The septal cartilage, from the top almost to the bottom between the nostrils and the two upper lateral nasal cartilages fuse together and to the nasal bone. (The lower nasal cartilages don't fuse, so the tip of the nose always stays very flexible. Your lower nasal cartilages make up more of your nose than hers, so more of your nose is flexible.)  Your nose will be bendable depending on how long your nasal bone is - it's longer in some than in others, and it's longer in adults than kids. Your nasal bone - the really hard part that projects down from between your eyebrows - may be short, making your nose more compressible. I said in the beginning "if you don't have any other problems". Place your index finger on your upper lip and press hard enough that you can feel your teeth and gums. Now move your whole finger up toward the columulla (it separates the two nostrils on the outside.) Did you feel a hard bone above your lip (it's kind of triangle shaped with the base - against your lip - wider than the tip (which fuses with the septal cartilage.) If you don't have a bone there, you should ask your doctor to check your nose just in case. Congenital anomalies of the nose are very rare and occur in 1/20,000
to 1/40,000 newborns, so it's highly unlikely you have one. Most of the time they are associated with other facial problems, for example a small chin (I can see yours, and it's fine). If you can breathe normally through your nose, and the only trick you can do with your body is to flatten your nose (great party trick!) you are just fine.

Note that this does not have to do with caffeine, but rather polyphenols, phytates found in them. So, my answer would be that both regular coffee and decaf coffee inhibit iron, but I don't know whether one does so more than the other. Also, if you add milk to your coffee, that may also have some effect, because calcium inhibits iron absorption.  It also depends on whether it's heme iron (mostly from animals) or non-heme iron (from plant sources, iron fortified foods). This matters if you eat primarily a vegetarian diet, because the recommended intake for non-heme iron is 1.8 times, compared to those who eat meat .   compiled a great literature review on iron intake.

315	563	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/563	Note: The following is excerpted from an article written in 2005. For lay (Non trained) people, there are more updated recommendations. The following is an example of the process, not the current recommendations. That is one of the opening paragraphs   published on the American Heart Association (AHA) website from 2005, regarding CPR evaluation and recommended changes. (VF SCA = Ventricular Fibrillation Sudden Cardiac Arrest) As a summation, a group of scientists and heart experts (281 experts over 36 months) gathered to review all the study and epidemiological data regarding survival rate in witnessed SCA. They reviewed the (then) current survival rates, sequence and priorities in CPR to see how differences affected the survival rate. There are 57 articles cited throughout the article that are all listed with links. One of the biggest factors was that few people received early CPR, and those that did, it wasn't always effective CPR. Some of the factors that they found were that chest compressions were inadequately performed, slow, and often interrupted for too long for rescue breaths, especially among lay CPR performers (Non EMS trained). This resulted in inadequate cerebral blood flow and cardiac output. Once they determined that, the following excerpt explains how they evaluated the recommended changes (at that time, this is a 2005 publication.) So basically, a panel of experts gets together and reviews current literature and reports on survival from both field and hospital based sources. Along with that they review changes and practices that have been implemented (There is reference to early Automatic External Defibrillator {AED} devices being a key factor in survival rates) since the last recommendation. They pair this with animal and computer modeling to determine what should used for compression rates and compression/breath ratios. As far as the differences, I do not know how to account for those other than people using outdated information, or not following guidelines. Here in the United States, (as far as I know), all CPR certification falls under the guidelines of the AHA.	2015-04-18 14:44:51Z	JohnP	9

There is a lot of research going on and as a result of the research, the guidelines are changed, each 5 years. (Last time the dept of the compression increased and the frequency went up.) We hope to receive the new guidelines in 2016. All ERC (European Resuscitation Council) trained instructors should use the same guidelines in their courses. The actual survival chance has increased a lot the last 20 years (if CPR is started with 6 minutes). Two pieces of equipment have helped.

The risk is higher especially in loud places as volume often needs to compete with the background noise. For example, the average sound level on a busy street is about 80dB. In the Airo study, when the outdoor noise was a mere 65dB, listeners raised headphone volume levels to over 80dB . This figure shows the average chosen listening levels for our subjects across the different background noise levels : When we experience sound in our environment (TV, radio, traffic), normally these sounds are at safe levels, however long period of exposure to high sound pressure levels at high volume can be damaging to sensitive structures in the inner ear and cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The anatomy of hearing loss (simplified view): Image credits:  Hearing damage from headphones is probably more common than from loudspeakers, even at comparable volumes, due to the close coupling of the transducers to the ears. Symptoms of hearing damage: The WHO recommends that young people limit the use of personal audio player to one hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise. NIOSH recommends a safe headphone listening volume of 85dB. Although headphones are not sold with SPL meters, they can be purchased separately.

It's effective against a wide variety of microorganisms.  Remember, though, that hand sanitizers don't remove dirt and chemicals from your skin, and all of the ingredients in hand sanitizers are left to fully absorb into your skin. Alcohol makes the skin a bit more permeable to chemicals, so the current recommendation in hospital workers is to wash with soap and water after a few uses of hand sanitizer. (See the first reference for the rest of us.) Hand sanitizers should primarily be used only as an optional follow-up to traditional hand washing with soap and water, except in situations where soap and water are not available. In those instances, use of an alcohol-based sanitizer is better than nothing at all. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer are about equal in their ability to remove or kill germs on hands, shown in many studies including one small one involving influenza: Soap and water eliminated more virus than the three alcohol-based hand rubs, although the difference between these strategies was not great. While in theory this remains possible, research so far has not found evidence that use of triclosan leads to bacterial resistance.

283	288	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/288	You're going to want to read the label from top to bottom. The first thing you will see at the top tells you the serving size and the amount of calories. It will say "Serving Size {x} " where x is the amount of whatever measurement is used. It may also give the amount of another measurement (usually grams) and sometimes even amount of how many of the product is one serving size (chip bags usually do this). Using the amount of servings that you eat, you can use simple math to determine how much of each nutrient/vitamin you have, this also includes the daily value percentage.  Under the serving size, there will be the amount of calories and the amount of calories from fat. The calories shown are the calories per serving, so if you eat two servings, then you can double the amount of calories. You can compare the calories that you eat to the daily amount you are supposed to have.  General rules for calories (based on a 2000 calorie diet) Calories from fat are just the amount of calories that come from fat in the product. Calories are important because eating too many calories is linked to obesity. The next section (under calories) on the food label is about the nutrients in the food. There are two subsections in this section, nutrients to limit and nutrients to get enough of. These nutrients have been shown to increased risks some cancers, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Getting more of these has been shown to reduce the risk of many of the diseases and problems mentioned, but you shouldn't have too many of these. These foods are neutral-ish, but there are some risks in having too much (over the limit) of these. In fact, too much sugar has been shown to increase the risk of diabetes. The nutrients to limit usually have both an actual amount and a daily value percentage (%DV) based on a 2000 calories diet. The nutrient to get enough of usually don't. Guide to %DV If you have something that has 20%DV of vitamin A, then there will 80%DV of vitamin A left. You could eat 4 more products with 20%DV of vitamin A or some other combination that equals 80%DV. There will three columns, one with the daily recommended amount for a 2000 calories diet and one for a 2500 calorie diet. All of the %DV are based on the 2000 calorie diet, but you can easily convert the percentages to the 2500 calorie diet if you have a calculator (or you can do them by hand). The one column I didn't mention is the calories column. If it says "Less than" then you should have less than the amount said in the column of the diet you are on. Usually "Total Fat", "Sat Fat", "Cholesterol", and "Sodium" will have a "Less than" next to them, so you should have less of these than the amount to the right says. "Total Carbohydrates" and under it "Dietary Fiber" will usually have nothing next to them, so you should get the recommended value to the right. This is a bit trickier than reading the actual label, but the ingredients should be put in order of quantity. There isn't any definite way to see the exact amount of each ingredient in the product, though. It is better to rely on the amount of each nutrient instead of trying to guess how much of each ingredient there is.

276	278	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/278	There is no cure for vitiligo, but there are treatments that may reduce the discoloring in your skin and possibly  even restore skin color. The main treatments used by doctors are either restoring the skin to normal color, or bleaching the skin, so that all of the skin is an even color. They do these things in a number of ways, including topical treatments and some surgical treatments. There still might be some side-effects, though. Some people might suffer from psychological distress, but as you said, that doesn't affect you. There is also an increased risk for sunburn and even skin cancer when exposed to the sun. Vitiligo can also cause inflammation of the iris, causing you to have eye problems. There is also a chance of hearing problems. Lastly, as a side-effect of any treatments you might be receiving, you may get dry skin and feel itchy. To help prevent these side-effects (besides the last one) there are many things you can do other than getting treatments. The most important thing is to protect yourself from UV light. It is recommended that you use sunscreen with at least 30 SPF(Sun Protection Factor). Try to be in the shade whenever possible and wear clothing that will protect your skin from the sun (ie: long sleeve shirts, pants, hats, etc.). Covering up will help with most side-effects, especially the sunburn and the skin cancer, which you are a higher risk for than eye or hearing problems. Also,   get a tattoo. Getting a tattoo will cause more damage to your skin, which can make more patches of vitiligo to appear on your skin.	2015-04-03 14:37:46Z	michaelpri	4

It assists with the mother's pain relief, initial bonding with her child, and forces the body to perform contractions. It has difficulty crossing the blood/brain barrier when administered intravenously, therefore the pain relief and other mental effects are significantly less pronounced. (When produced naturally during childbirth it is secreted by the hypothalamus, placenta, and ovaries.)  Synthetic oxytocin (it usually has the trade names Pitocin or Syntocinon) is typically administered to induce regular contractions. Its standard use during labour is rather controversial outside of the USA, due to a direct statistical correlation with unnecessary C-Sections and other complications for both mother and child.	2015-04-03 10:13:11Z	Community	-1

Benadryl (trade name) is also known as   (generic name);   (generic name) is also known as Claritin (trade name). Both drugs are primarily antihistamines and primarily active antagonists at the H1 subtype of histamine receptor. It is this property that makes them effective for treatment of allergies.  The difference between the two medications is that   is a first generation or “non-selective” antihistamine. The term “non-selective” refers to these drugs' activity at a variety of receptors other than H1 - primarily, acetylcholine receptors. This can lead to more anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, etc. First generation antihistamines are also highly  , which means they cross the blood-brain barrier and have central nervous system activity. It is this property which makes them quite sedating (primarily due to activity at CNS histamine receptors). Second generation antihistamines were designed to avoid some of the side effects of first generation agents. They are more specific for the H1 receptor and are mostly  , meaning they poorly penetrate the blood-brain barrier, resulting in fewer CNS effects. For more information about antihistamines, this   is quite informative.    Probably not. It’s just a matter of dose that determines how much anti-histamine activity each provides. The trouble is that many people will find the side effects of diphenhydramine and other non-selective agents to be dose-limiting, in which case practically it may not be as effective. I see no clear benefit to this. Again, their activity against hay fever is mediated by the same receptor. As such, they will just have additive effects. Taking twice as much of one or the other would similarly increase activity against hay fever and/or to contribute to untoward side effects. So it’s “OK” to take them together in the same way that it’s “OK” to take twice as much of either one.  In general, I see little reason to use diphenhydramine for allergic indications unless there is a desire for the sedative properties. Loratadine and other second generation agents have overtaken it in usefulness in this area.	2015-04-02 21:24:09Z	Susan	10

There are empirical observations and actuarial tables/considerations, but there hasn't been a definitive "For a 30 year old Caucasian male, 8-15% body fat is ideal for health" studies out yet. There was a study in 2000 that was published in the   that attempted to lay some groundwork for this kind of evaluation, and they came up with some interesting formulae for body fat assessment, but it was left as very open ended and needing much more study. There is a chart available through the American Council on Exercise (ACE) that shows levels of fat for various categories of men and women, but it makes no distinction on age, merely on activity level. Another pair of charts from Accufitness (Makers of body fat calipers) I like better, as it accounts for both age and sex, but makes no allowances for activity level. 
 If you look at BMI charts, anything below 18.5 is considered unhealthy, and anything over 25-30 (depending on chart) is trending towards the obese range. These are more statistical/actuarial tables than anything, however and have been around (largely unchanged) since inception in the early/mid 1800's. As far as the measurement, there are three different types of fat, subcutaneous (under the skin), visceral (Around body organs) and intramuscular (In the muscles, like marbling on a steak). Bioelectric impedance (Such as the scale you mention) work by passing a low electric current through the body and measuring the resistance. These can have a +/- accuracy range of 3-10% depending on the model, and can be affected by hydration, time of day, wet skin, and other factors. Skin calipers done by an experienced practitioner can have a variance as low as 3%, underwater weighing (Again done properly) can get below 3%, and the gold standard is a DXA scan that measures everything from bone density to total fat. So far everyone agrees that too low or too high a weight is bad and carries risk of injury/illness/disease, but we haven't agreed yet on what is good for which population cohort.	2015-04-02 22:02:22Z	JohnP	8

Ketosis may improve your weight loss by burning fat more efficiently. However there are considerable between-subject variations in this.

It can't say no to digesting food, it will begin to rot (gas anyone?) and it needs that food to generate more energy later on. But it can't say no to exercise, that could very realistically kill you in a survival situation. So it does a compromise, both will function at decreased levels. This doesn't mean you can't eat food while exercising. As otherwise mentioned, marathoners do consume food. But it's unlikely they will eat complex foods like fat or protein and go straight to simple foods like carbohydrates since it is easier for the body to break it down. Despite simple foods, energy must be used to digest so it makes exercising harder. But the benefit of the energy is more quickly greater then not consuming it. Consuming too much can override this though.   There aren't any long term marathoners I know of that eat a thanksgiving dinner prior and expect to make it very far.	2015-04-02 20:07:10Z	Miati	10

So when you eat shortly before exercising, you need the energy at two places (digestion and muscles) and the muscles win. This does not mean it is bad to eat before (or during) exercise. Some exercises (like running a marathon) requires you to replenish the energy (and the food) but you can't eat anything. You need to time your consumption. (Heavy foods take longer to digest so the time gap needs to be longer).  I have most of this information from a book on sport injuries. But I have found a  .	2015-04-02 18:01:05Z	Toon Krijthe	5

Too much fat or protein can only slow down the  movement of foods from the stomach making you feel uncomfortable .  It's also important to be well hydrated when exercise, and when digesting food the water is important as part of the digestion process to break down the fat molecules, so you can be more easily dehydrated. During the digestion process, your body produces more   (stomach acid) and if you'd change your body position during the exercises, you put more pressure on your LES ( ).

As far as health goes, it would depend much more on the quality of ingredients they're getting. I'm not talking about microbiologic or viral issues either, I'm talking like the ppm of heavy metals contained in the syrup. Lab cleanliness certainly is important, but not as important as the purity of the starting ingredients. Almost all e-juice on the market is USP grade. If you were worried about contaminants, just by using reagent grade or higher and a cheap DIY glove box with basic sterilizing equipment, you've already exceeded the cleanliness of every commercial e-juice on the market that I've seen. After that it's just a matter of following proper ISO protocols in regard to laboratory cleanliness and how much money you want to spend. Cheapest option for a sterile e-juice would be to build a large positive pressure glove box and use only sterile pre packaged tools and sterilization and depyrogenation of beakers/etc. all of which are far, far beyond necessary for making a liquid you're are then going to deliver by dumping into an open-air vial and then super heating to the point of vaporization + inhaling. More than necessary, but not, in anyway, unobtainable for a home laboratory. So the answer is "It depends". Are all DIYers going to be cleaner than all manufacturers? No. Are all manufacturers going to be cleaner than all DIYers? Also no. Is your friend's DIY juice 'good enough' to use? I would ask to watch him while he makes it, take note of his lab practices and chemical purity levels, and then make my decision based on how much his lab resembles the cleanliness standards of your average meth lab. Really though, if he's at least following basic food safety protocols, and not using some below-food-grade chemicals to make his e-juice you're probably not going to die if you take a hit.	2018-01-25 04:26:55Z	Noah Wood	-2

The liquid itself would most likely provide a really nice environment for bacterial growth if it is stored at a appropriate temperature.

191	949	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/949	I have suffered acutely from this phenomenon, and tried every single item in the list given in the accepted answer (as well as many others). The most important thing I found is separating the click from the move. So one hand moves and the other clicks. I've mapped the "Fn" key on the bottom left of my Apple wireless keyboard to the left mouse button using "Karabiner". I use a gel mousepad and hold the mouse between the thumb and third finger. What I have noticed is that typical mouse movement requires you to clamp the position of the mouse while you click, so that it doesn't move even by one pixel. If you observe children attempting to use the mouse, you'll see that initially they have difficulty clicking, the click smears and turns into a drag. If you try using the mouse with your other hand, you will become aware of this. And I think it is the movement of a tendon through the wrist and arm in this state of tension that causes the pain. Previously I have used a footpedal to perform the click. I rigged it up so that it is beneath my heel, and lifting creates the mouse-down.  So that the foot is naturally in a relaxed position. Initially I was using this together with a head-pointing device, but as my health improved the path of least resistance returned (over several years) to being a conventional mouse. Also alternating hands for the mouse is a good idea. Train yourself to use both hands. Using speech recognition is essential also to take load off the hands. I wouldn't be able to function without it now. On OS X this is now excellent -- I don't even need an external microphone. Additionally I have got myself a standing workspace.

One of the biggest benefits of eating spicy foods, especially chili peppers, is that it helps you lose weight. Spicy foods help to raise your metabolic rate, which will slow down your weight gain. If you eat spicy foods often, the effects add up. A 2007 study by Nottingham University  found that spicy foods can help kill cancer cells. Capsaicin, which is what makes many foods spicy, attacks the mitochondria of the cancer cells, triggering their death.  Spicy foods have also been found to help decongest your sinuses. A 1998 study  found that a capsaicin nasal spray helped to clear the sinuses of people. Eating spicy foods has been known to have a similar effect. Now for some risks of eating spicy food. When you are eating spicy foods, there are only a few risks to watch out for. Spicy foods have been known as foods that can trigger heartburn, so anyone with heartburn should avoid them.  Some spicy foods that don't contain capsaicin, like horseradish, can sometimes damage tissue. There are usually more risks when handling spicy foods, especially peppers. If pepper juice gets in your eye, it will cause pain and possibly swelling. If this ever happens, there are ways to flush out your eyes.  Handling peppers and sometimes horseradish before eating can cause pain, swelling, redness, and irritation in your hand.

The reason it is recommended that you ice immediately after you see symptoms of tendinitis is so you can relieve the pain quicker. Icing after a few days will probably be little less effective (the tendon will have also healed a bit naturally, so the difference will be less), but if you can get rid of the pain and reduce the inflammation earlier, why wouldn't you?

If collagen formation is blocked this naturally leads to possible rupture of tendon. It is also important to note that GCs should never be injected IN tendon.

For example, in France (As I'm sure you are aware), if a person   to render assistance to a person in danger then they can by held liable. This falls under the "duty to rescue" concept. Here in the United States (and elsewhere), this is covered by something called the " ", which is intended to remove the fear of litigation preventing someone from aiding another in times of distress. However, it is not a blanket immunity from someone suing. One of the concepts that I was taught when I was a first responder and ER medic in the Armed Forces, is that you are pretty much safe if you act in a manner consistent with either your own training or the training of the general person on the street. While it is not a guarantee, if you stick within the scope of your training and provide assistance, then you should pretty much be protected. You may still be sued, as there is no bar against a lawsuit being brought, but the Samaritan concept should protect you. Note, this is not something that covers everything. For example, I was trained and certified in starting IV fluids. US protocol, however, provides that this can only be done when there is contact with a medical control available, and transport to a facility. If I came upon a hiking accident and whipped out an IV, I could still be held liable since that is out of protocol, and I would be considered to be acting outside the scope of common practice. If you are traveling, your best bet is to look up the laws of emergency responders in the country you are going to. In some countries if it becomes known that you have the certification and you passed by an accident, you can then be held liable and possibly removed from certification because you failed in your duty to act.	2015-04-01 19:33:02Z	JohnP	8
155	238	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/238	There is some research that has been done on this, as well as some more anecdotal/lifestyle based evidence. There is a study done in 1914, published in the  , where they examined the carbon dioxide tension of the blood after eating. CO2 tension is a byproduct of food metabolism, and in high amounts can cause dyspnea, acidosis and possibly altered consciousness. The findings showed that standing, then sitting, then lying each produced higher CO2 tension than the previous position. Trendelenburg (Lying with head lower than legs) produced less than lying, approximating the sitting position. Sitting erect also had lower tension than sitting reclined. More anecdotally,   looks at the traditional Indian position of sitting on the floor while eating, which promotes a more erect sitting stance than sitting on a chair/couch or reclining while eating. While not backed up with studies, it also claims that the vagus nerve response is enhanced in this position, resulting in quicker time to satiety (You eat less as a result). Many Middle Eastern cultures eat this way, as do more traditional Asian homes where the seats are merely cushions on a floor around a short table. There are many other benefits listed in the article, but for brevity and provability I won't cite them all here. I also ran across references (But was unable to find the actual study) to a 2007 study involving women published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, that found people standing up tended to pay less attention to the food, and as a result ate faster and more. It's fairly well established that the vagus nerve response to feel full is in the neighborhood of 20 minutes to take effect, so if you eat slower (as promoted by sitting down) you will also tend to eat less overall. It's also been shown that eating without distractions such as television and reading promotes lower consumption overall. So in effect, it appears that sitting in an erect position is possibly the best happy medium, and if possible, eating without distractions to be able to concentrate on the food. Especially if you suffer from acid upsets or other related ailments, the more erect you are the more you may ease your symptoms.	2015-04-02 16:59:02Z	JohnP	8

The process involves first cutting a corneal flap to allow access to the defective corneal tissue. This process involves keeping the eye open, and making an incision across the protective cornea tissue to form a flap. This is achieved via a suction ring. The flap is then lifted back (note that it is still connected to the rest of the eye). Lasers are then used to reshape the cornea tissue to remove the defects. The flap is pulled back over the cornea tissue and left to heal. The laser used operates using rapid pulses of low-energy-level ultraviolet light.

124	152	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/152	Your body uses motion in several ways to maintain function.
One of them is called muscle milking
Muscle Milking is the process where blood is pushed back up to your heart by your muscles compressing on the veins. Since the veins have valves to ensure one-way direction, compression (usage) of the muscles causes it to move up, against gravity. Lymph also piggybacks on this process to push fluid upwards, otherwise occasionally resulting in edema. Movement of blood is incredibly important. It transports white blood cells to fight various infections in your body, platelets have a tendency to start clotting when blood is moving too slow for a extended period of time (however are extremely important in injuries), nutrients are carried from your intestines, oxygen is carried to cells and carbon dioxide is carried away, filtering by the kidney's, etc. Another component is the the body's powerful ability to adapt. It doesn't like spending energy when it doesn't have to. Sitting for extended periods of time frequently means your heart doesn't need to be very strong. Should at some point you do need it to do more (like when you're standing or exercising) it must quickly work overtime to keep up. This invites high blood pressure, dizziness and general fatigue. To push the point, imagine someone who has been bed-ridden for several weeks due to surgery, illness, etc. While in supine (lying on your back) the person may feel fine. However when sitting up the person experiences dizziness, light-headedness and occasionally nausea. Overtime, especially following exercises, the symptoms fade as the body adjusts to being in a sitting position. The same occurs when standing The solution is simple. Move. Work out so that periods of inactivity are the exception and not the norm. A strong heart can handle higher level exercises and inactivity. A weak heart will have trouble with the former. Also, it's the inactivity with sitting that is unhealthy. You can stand and be inactive just as well (standing desk).  @kevin The blood vessels constantly vaso dilate (get wider) and vaso constrict as needed.
Following a nights sleep, you may feel dizzy if you quickly stand up. This is because over the course of the night you were likely sitting in supine. Since only minimal pressure is needed to maintain flow in supine, the vessels can vaso dilate.  Upon standing or sitting, the situation changes quickly and the body is not quick enough to respond. Since the body cannot get blood to the highest point (brain) fast enough, it cannot function. Luckily, when people faint they go into a horizontal posture, rapidly providing blood to the brain again. The above invites trauma of course, but the risk of trauma is less of a issue then the lack of nutrients to the brain.	2015-04-01 16:25:29Z	Miati	13

If you remove the calluses, then you will need to either wear gloves or other protective gear to prevent them from reforming. Once you have calluses, there are a few ways you can reduce them. It's not recommended to simply cut them off or similar, as the skin underneath will (generally) not be sufficient to protect the area when the stress reoccurs. This can lead to blisters and/or breaks in the skin, which opens up the possibility of infections. Lotions and soaks such as epsom salts can help soften the area, and then something like a pumice stone can be gently used to abrade away the surface of the callus. Again, do not try to remove the entire area at one time. There are also many home remedies such as soaking in chamomile tea and similar, but I have no experience with their efficacy. If you wish to prevent them in the future, take note of where on your hands they form, and then look for gloves that have padding in those specific areas. Be aware, that even with good gloves, you may still get callus formation.	2015-04-01 14:44:00Z	JohnP	2

In a number of emergencies, such as severe drug reactions, life-threatening asthma or allergies, or inflammatory conditions (such as your example of arthritis), no other drugs act like steroids. They act quickly and effectively, reducing inflammation and decreasing allergic responses, opening swollen airways, etc. They are used because they are so effective. Steroids do have side effects; they can cause kidney stones, decrease bone density, may cause diabetes, nervous system related diseases and many more, but only when used continuously for more than 3 to 6 months or so. Usually, however, steroids are only used until the patient is out of danger or experiences relief of their sudden severe pain.   Steroids are not alien to our bodies; they are naturally produced by the adrenal gland, which lies above kidney. Therefore they are unlike paracetamol (which we take for fever) and other drugs which are synthetic (not natural). By giving steroids to patients, we are just strengthening a natural response our bodies attempt to mount.  I suggest you not take any steroid for more than 3 months, and only under a doctor's supervision. Your doctor can advise you of any alternatives to steroids if available.	2015-04-01 16:22:02Z	anongoodnurse	4

108	112	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/112	 is the common name of one particular species of the genus Aloe (member of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family). There are over 420 different plant species and the most commonly used in consumer products. Most commonly used is Aloe barbadensis, Aloe barbadensis (Mill.) or (Miller) or Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f. (scientific name). The primary component of the plant used in most products is the leaf, which can be processed in two ways to make aloe vera juice, powder or concentrate. The other substance found within the leaf that has been used in commerce, primarily as an OTC laxative drug, is the aloe latex.  For oral consumption Aloe vera needs to be carefully filtered by different processing procedures: In some other countries Aloe vera juice is produced using the patented   method. Once Aloe vera gel is filtered out for consumption, then it's considered safe, because without filtration it can be harmful causing potential toxicity when swallowed.  Aloe vera that contains   (however it's not for sure) in excess amounts may induce side effects, but there is very little data about what levels of aloin are in most liquid products (according to one research, it's less than 1ppm), however in solid/semi-solid products it could be 10-100 times higher.  If aloin is the cause of the tumors in rats, then the lower the concentration of aloin, then it's less harmful. However more research is needed to answer these questions. In US Aloe vera is a dietary supplement and it's not regulated drug, so there is no guarantee of strength, purity, or safety of these products. Currently Aloe vera is approved by FDA as a food addictive for flavor. In the UK, European Union, China, and Korea content and purity of Aloe is regulated by   (International Aloe Science Council Seal of Approval) which established standards to define what is (and what is not) "aloe vera" in finished products. The IASC standard states that only products containing acemannan, or the beta 1-4 acetylated glucomannans, can be accurately labeled as aloe vera. Acemannan is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is present in aloe vera and is used as an identifier of the botanical by analytical means. Products that do not contain acemannan are not considered to be true aloe vera based on this standard. In countries where Aloe vera is regulated, you should check the label for seal-based certification (see:  ). You may also check the  . Also make sure that   content has been removed.

Soups can be eaten cold or at room temperature, and you can lower your body temperature slightly with iced drinks, quick sponge baths, etc. But controlling the most frequent causes of nosebleeds might help you reduce their occurrance. The vast majority of bloody noses in healthy individuals (by that, I mean people without specific diseases of the blood or mucous membranes, etc.) arise from one specific area in the nose (on either side): In the mucosa of the nasal septum (the cartilagenous structure separating the nose into two sides), there is an area where several arteries "meet", giving it an exceptionally rich vascular supply, called Kiesselbach's plexus. It is on the anterior surface, and exposed to dry air and trauma (even such as might be sustained by a bad cold). People often get nosebleeds from nasal mucosal irritation due to upper respiratory infections. Bleeding typically occurs when the mucosa erodes for any reason, and the capillaries and venules (and sometimes arterioles) become exposed and subsequently break. The result is the familiar bloody dripping of a nosebleed. The most common treatment is   (squeezing the sides of the nose together) for 5-10 minutes. This works because putting direct pressure on any bleed stops the blood flow long enough for a clot to form and the arteriole to close down. If needed, more aggressive control can be achieved by a professional. Besides the immediate treatment of bloody noses, anything that helps with the integrity of the nasal mucosa is going to help reduce nosebleeds.

102	714	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/714	Traditionally, if you had headaches you would discuss your symptoms with a doctor who would then classify the type of headache you had based on what you reported. If you didn't think of something to report, or didn't think (for example) that your nausea was related to your headaches (and so didn't report it), then your headache type may be misdiagnosed. Personally, I received several different "headache diagnoses" over the years, depending on how I reported my symptoms and the doctor I was seeing at the time. In 2003, a group of researchers published a study (Lipton) where they determined the ID Migraine test was a reliable screening test for determining whether a patient had migraine. This test was further validated by additional studies in 2011 (Cousins), and has since been translated into additional languages and studied further (Karli).  The ID Migraine test is considered positive for migraine if the patient answers yes to 2 or more of the following 3 questions:   More generally, the   may include: Severity of migraine is usually judged based on how the symptoms affect the patient's ability to conduct daily activities. There are several scales available to test this, but the two most popular seem to be the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) and the Headache Impact Test (HIT). MIDAS was developed in 2001 (Steward) and is based on asking the patient to count the number of days they have been impacted by their headaches (specifically addressing work, household, and social activities). The more days a person is impacted, the more severe their migraine is considered.  MIDAS can be   at the American Headache Society. HIT is a newer test, developed in 2011 (Yang). It asks the patient to consider the impact of migraine on their activities in the past 4 weeks, on a five point scale that progresses from "Never" to "Always". Having more responses on the positive end of the scale (Sometimes/Very Often/Always) will indicate that a person is more severely affected by migraine. The HIT can be   on the National Headaches Foundation. Cousins G1, Hijazze S, Van de Laar FA, Fahey T.

101	143	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/143	There are three main types of stretching that the general layman will be familiar with. There are a couple of others, but they are extreme techniques, and generally not used by the everyday athlete. Ballistic is old fashioned, and has been contraindicated for quite a while. One of the big risks is activating the stretch reflex in the tendon (This is what causes your knee to jerk when the doctor whacks you with the hammer), and this causes your muscle to try and tighten (shorten) at the same time you are actively lengthening it. This can produce tears, avulsions or tendon ruptures. Dynamic is recommended before activity, especially if you are doing an activity that requires great extremes of motion (Such as martial arts or gymnastics). This is simply doing the motions of the sport starting with slow, short movements and gradually increasing the range and power. Skips into bounds before running is one example of this. As evidenced  , dynamic stretching before activity showed greater gains in jump power, where ballistic and static stretching did not show the same gains. Static should be done after activity if it is done. Several studies have shown that static stretching before activity (especially in power based activities) actually decreases performance. The main purpose of static stretching is to increase range of motion (ROM) in the area being stretched.   shows a decreased resistance to passive resistive torque (How far the joint can move before resistance begins), i.e. gains in flexibility with static where ballistic did not show the improvement. Ballistic did, however, reduce stiffness in the studied tendon (Achilles). There is currently no evidence that stretching will alleviate muscle pain, and while it is popular to do, not much evidence that it helps alleviate cramps, either. Static stretching (contrary to popular belief) has also not been proven to reduce injury rates ( ) or assist with such things as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), "flush" lactate out of the muscles, or anything. If it helps relax you, or if you need extreme ranges of motion for a specific sport, it can help, but other than that, there isn't much evidence for it to support performance increases. Also, since you mention that you play baseball, there is some evidence (Although I can't find the study at the moment) that preswing warmups should be done with a lightweight bat rather than a weighted bat, as it helps increase the following swing speeds. Addition: While reading through references, I did find some notations that ballistic stretching post exercise could possibly produce greater gains in flexibility, at the cost of a higher injury risk.	2015-04-01 14:59:45Z	JohnP	13

When you say stretching, I hope you mean dynamic as opposed to static stretching especially if you are about to compete in a sport. If you are referring to static stretching, taking a shower may be a better option then, but if you mean dynamic stretching, a shower will not provide a greater benefit. For peak performance, athletes or weekend warriors should use dynamic stretching prior to an event. However, static stretching does not improve performance and can actually lead to injury.

In a state of inaction, your muscles contract and tighten, and also lose heat. This makes them brittle and inert. Going straight into heavy exercise can cause significant damage, and so in going from inactive to fully active, you should ideally 'warm-up' with a more moderate set of exercises. This can include stretching, and should address all the muscle groups your main activity uses. Here are some references that agree with me: With running you can combine the warm-up into the run by starting off by almost walking.	2015-04-01 11:30:13Z	JonMark Perry	5

This means that the a1c test is measuring blood glucose from a population of cells that are older than the expected 3 months AND added to many more new cells.

This is fairly easy in this type of diet, as eggs contain complete proteins. There are also a few plant sources (such as quinoa, buckwheat and hempseed) that contain either a complete protein profile or the 9 essential amino acids in good amounts. Hempseed also contains Omega-3 fatty acids which can be difficult to get without seafood. One of the main reasons for healthy fats in the diet is for the proper transport of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) into the body. Nuts and avocados are examples of healthy fats, as are olives and olive oils. If possible, for olive oils get extra virgin and as fresh as possible, as this will ensure the highest levels of polyphenols. Along with the basic considerations, you need to be aware of possible deficiencies due to age, sex, things of this nature. For example,   suggests that B-12 deficiency can be a problem in pregnant lacto-ovo vegetarians. High soy intake can possibly impact estrogen levels in both men and women, and possibly delay maturation/height in maturing individuals, although this is only a precaution (most of what I've read suggests further studies are needed).

While meat contains all essential amino acids, common vegetable foods -individually- lack some essential amino acid. The essential amino acids that are not found in some vegetable foods can be found in other vegetable foods, for this reason it's important to eat variedly.

It is calculated as the number of times per hour that the airway partially or completely collapses, associated with a drop in oxygen levels.  Partial collapse is labeled a hypopnea, whereas complete collapse is labeled an apnea. CPAP treatment uses air pressure delivered through a mask to stent open the airway.  : 
Where are you getting this AHI? Most likely, you’re reading it off a PAP machine. The upshot of this answer is that, as much as we all love numbers, such readings should not be trusted. The AHI was initially validated in the setting of overnight polysomnography, i.e. a sleep lab. There a technician watches the tracings generated from a nasal pressure transducer, chest/abdomen effort belts, and continuous pulse oximetry. There are specific criteria for scoring apneas and hypopneas. The recommended   for a hypopnea are now: There has been   of controversy in recent years as to whether that number in the c criterion should be 3% or 4% drop in pulse oximetry.    The number you’re getting off your PAP machine has no pulse oximetry to correlate with. They must therefore be using some   non-standard metric. How do they calculate this? This, unfortunately, is proprietary information known only to the PAP manufacturers. Occasionally there are validation studies of varying quality published, but there is no uniformity in the industry as to what algorithm is used, and there is very little transparency about where these numbers are coming from.  
Monitoring of sleep apnea treatment is symptom-based. If symptoms improve, good enough, keep with it. If there is inadequate improvement or recurrence of symptoms after improvement, things should be re-evaluated. Generally this involves one or more of the following:    : Most likely, in the next few years these technologies will get better, and hopefully transparency and uniformity will improve.

Regarding the following that I found below, I believe "alkalinize" can't be taken to mean below neutral. I think it means that it lowers the pH level, whether to basic or less acidic.

Your sensitivity really depends on your body tolerance threshold (e.g. renal threshold for blood) and your average daily intake, in other words it's determined by the efficiency of the human body to process and metabolize caffeine.

57	14108	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/14108	Based on my medical knowledge and a literature search, I cannot find evidence to suggest that banana peels are a superior treatment for warts. I saw only one nearly 40-year-old study on PubMed,  Warzawer-Schwarcz L. "Treatment of plantar warts with banana skin." Plast Reconstr Surg. 1981 Dec;68(6):975-6.  
This study involved taping fresh banana peel every day to the wart using surgical tape, and then scraping chunks out of the softened wart repeatedly. It seems like the primary function of the banana peel was to make the skin damp and soft for scraping. I actually think using just duct tape instead could accomplish a similar function (keeping skin damp), with the advantage that the tape can naturally pull off chunks of wart when you rip it off. Another study found that duct tape actually can be effective for wart removal; researchers theorize this is because the duct tape may be stimulating the immune system (see here:  ). Also, personal story, when I was a kid I got rid of a wart on my hand using the duct tape method.  My main recommendation, though, would be to try freezing it off again, or getting it cut out. I don't know how many times you've tried freezing it, but warts can be fairly determined and may require multiple freezings to disappear. You may also want to try a different dermatologist - perhaps your current dermatologist doesn't have good freezing technique. You can also have the wart cut out, though that will have longer recovery time.  I think you've got a lot of options - don't give up! Sometimes a combination of therapies can be effective. For example, I once also got rid of a wart on my foot using drug store salicylic acid stickers, repeated scraping to remove dead skin and dead wart tissue, followed by freezing.  Additional information: Warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV16 and HPV18 cause cervical cancer; HPV6 and HPV11 cause genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis; but there are also many types of HPV that are not sexually transmitted and merely cause skin warts (see the Wikipedia article  ). 	2017-10-24 23:31:34Z	veritessa	1

Wart removal rarely involves anything more complicated than an at-home remedy and usually over-the-counter medicines can help (liquid, cream, or bandage forms) by applying them directly to the wart.

So warts are the effects of being low in potassium, so it's likely that banana peels would help in this case as it's rich in potassium (as well as potato peels and Apple Cider Vinegar). And increasing your intake of potassium will limit the chances of your warts coming back. Bananas are considered safe to use as there are no side effects. So I'd say it's worth to try.

The recent (2015) measles outbreaks in California are a good example: at least 70-80% of those infected were unvaccinated (including a number of newborns too young to be vaccinated). Simply put, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to be carrying a vaccine-preventable disease compared to the rest of the population. If your newborn is not vaccinated yet he or she is at risk. In the case of measles or whooping cough, an infection could turn deadly, as can many others.

51	12754	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/12754	Consumption of carbohydrates is necessary to sustain life and mental health. Eating or drinking carbs stresses the body both when consuming too much or too little. Today's diabetic diet do include carbohydrates.  For a little background, the pancreas serves two functional purposes. It provides the endocrine hormones that balance the sugar available in the blood stream. For the endocrine function, it produces insulin and glucagon from the Beta cells. Insulin is the catalyst for cells to pull in sugar from the blood. Glucagon tells the liver to dump glycogen to raise up blood sugar. The glucagon is dumped when the pituitary signals the adrenal glands to go into fight-or-flight mode. It boosts the available energy. Drinking simple sugars like the ones in soft drinks is an easily metabolized sugar, and it makes the pancreas work extra hard. At the same time, if the person has insulin resistance, the pancreas has to pump out even more to get the sugar from the blood into cells. Eventually the pancreas just stops functioning when it is worked too hard. The second function of the pancreas is exocrine, and it produces enzymes to help the body digest food and absorb vitamins. One of the enzymes also aids in the digestion of carbohydrates.  So to make a long story short, yes, consuming high amounts of sugar may increase your risk of diabetes, especially type 2. However, the bigger risks factors, for diabetes and the potential of pancreatic cancer, are stress, alcohol consumption and eating red meats.

46	77	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/77	There have been numerous studies on this topic, and there are a number of artificial sweeteners, so the following is a discussion of three of the most important, saccharin, cyclamate and aspartame, as well as three more which are currently approved for use in food by the FDA, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, and neotame, in less detail. There have been over 50 studies discussing saccharin, specifically its effects on rats, especially regarding cancer. About 20 of these involved rats consuming saccharin for over 1.5 years, nineteen of which found no significant differences between rats fed saccharin and rats not fed saccharin.  The cancer-positive study did find a link between saccharin and bladder cancer, but used a type of rat susceptible to bladder cancer.   There have also been multi-generational studies in which saccharin was fed to rats and their offspring, and found that male, second-generation rats fed saccharin were more at risk for bladder cancer than male, second-generation rats not fed saccharin.    However, the same link could not be found in humans, as studies have found that cancer in rats is not a good predictor of cancer in humans. For example, low doses of Vitamin C cause cancer in rats.  With no conclusive evidence linking saccharin to human health risk, bans on saccharin were lifted, at least in the United States. After being approved by the FDA for use in food in 1951, cyclamate became a common artificial sweetener in American households. After a study in 1969 found links between cyclamate and bladder cancer in rats,  the FDA banned cyclamate in food. Later, a long-term study was conducted in which monkeys were fed cyclamate every day for 24 years. One group was fed cyclamate at dosages equivalent to 6 cans of diet soda a day, another at dosages equivalent to 30 cans of diet soda a day. The study concluded that there is no significant link between cyclamate and cancer in monkeys.  While a petition has been filed with the FDA for the lifting of the cyclamate ban, however, the petition is not being actively considered for reasons unrelated to cancer. Approved for use in food by the FDA in 1981, a 1996 study posited a possible link between a general increase in brain tumor incidence and aspartame.  A multitude of studies followed, among the largest of which found no link between aspartame consumption and brain tumors,  and no link between aspartame consumption and changes in brain function. At one point, an editorial intended to directly address the 1996 study revealed that the conclusion was largely the result of ecological fallacy, essentially blind assumption.  Of course, this is a small sample of the large numbers of studies conducted, including a human study that found little evidence that aspartame is likely to act as a human brain carcinogen. Eventually, the FDA released a statement citing a press release by the European Food Safety Authority. The statement, in addition to declaring its intent to better study aspartame, stated that the FDA has not been presented with scientific information that would support a change in its conclusions about the safety of aspartame. Acesulfame potassium was approved by the FDA for use in food in 1988. Sucralose was approved by the FDA for use in food in 1998. Neotame was approved by the FDA for use in food in 2002. The FDA states that it reviewed more than 100 safety studies before approving these sweeteners, and that the results of these studies showed no evidence that these sweeteners cause cancer or pose any other threat to human health. There have been a number of studies reviewing the safety of common artificial sweeteners, with mixed results. However, the quorum conclusion appears to be that even in very high doses, these substances are safe for human consumption. Note, however, that a number of artificial sweeteners were not discussed above, some of which may pose health risks.	2015-04-01 00:48:24Z	TheEnvironmentalist	18

But nothing comes for free. There are  . The best alternative is to reduce or remove sugar from your diet as much as possible. Side effects of artificial sweeteners are: Artificial sweeteners are rich in carbohydrates. They increase your appetite thus increasing calorie consumption, which ultimately leads to weight gain. you tend to eat larger portions when you eat foods with artificial sweeteners. They may disrupt body’s ability to regulate blood sugar, causing metabolic changes that can be a precursor to diabetes. According to the recent reports, too much consumption of artificial sweeteners instead of sugar is one of the major causes of diabetes. The risk of coronary heart disease gets significantly elevated in those who consume more than two artificially sweetened beverages a day. It has the same effect as sugar-sweetened foods. It increases the risk of cardiovascular disorders. Metabolic Syndrome is a group of conditions that commonly include blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol levels that occur together and increase your risk of stroke, heart disease, and other diseases. It has been observed that people consuming artificial sweeteners on regular basis have a double risk of contracting metabolic syndrome compared to non-consumers. Artificial Sweeteners are a lot sweeter than regular table sugar. The exposure of your taste buds to such high intensity of sweetness makes them less receptive to naturally occurring sweet foods, such as fruits. Also, when your taste buds become dull, you tend to seek out sweeter food to satiate your sweet cravings. If you are really looking for a sugar substitute, then it’s always better to go for natural sweeteners like Honey. It will provide taste without being a potential hazard to your health.	2016-10-26 12:15:58Z	fahad1991	-2

This include decreased cancer, tumors, vision impairment or even blindness ( ), hearing impairment, neurologic, psychological, psychiatric, chest, gastrointestinal, skin and allergies, endocrine and metabolic problems and many other. In addition, the symptoms of Aspartame Toxicity include: brain damage, birth defects, peptic ulcers, etc. Headaches are the most common symptom reported by consumers . However FDA analyzed 251 reports of seizure anecdotally associated with aspartame consumption (received through ARMS from 1986–1990) and concluded that approximately half were highly unlikely to be related to aspartame . The safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies since its initial approval by the FDA since 1974. In Nov 1996 John W. Olney, M.D, reported that brain tumor rates had risen for 17 years with a sudden 10% increase three years after aspartame was introduced. Olney linked aspartame's mutagenicity to the function of aspartate as an excitotoxic neurotransmitter. In 1999 Dr. Ralph Walton declared that NutraSweet-funded studies showed in general safety in comparison to 83 of 90 independent studies which showed it harmful . In   reported multiple tumors of different types and sites. Another   showed multipotential carcinogenicity at a dose level close to the acceptable daily intake for humans and its carcinogenic effects are increased. Another independent self-funded 2,5-year study found huge tumors as result of putting aspartame in the form of packets of NutraSweet in the drinking water of 60 rats (a dose equivalent to that of 14 cans of diet — a number considered ‘reasonable’ by the FDA - a 50mg per kilogram ratio): This experiment resulted in the book:   as well as the shorter summary version  . Aspartame researcher Dr. Soffritti did a similar pair of studies to Innes-Brown’s and his first study found that consumption of the equivalent of 4 to 5 bottles of diet soda per day yielded high rates of cancerous growths among many of his subjects. Such studies have indicated that aspartame can yield other more dangerous chemicals such as methanol and  . See also: Upon ingestion, aspartame breaks down into 3 main components : However according to studies the methanol from aspartame is unlikely to be a safety concern . Aspartame has been found to be safe for human consumption by more than ninety countries worldwide with with FDA officials describing aspartame as "one of the most thoroughly tested and studied food additives the agency has ever approved" . The agency says the more than 100 toxicological and clinical studies it has reviewed confirm that aspartame is safe for the general population.

It exhibits remarkably low toxicity , however LD  in humans remains unknown given lack of any accidental or intentional poisoning death data. Government recommended intake: Based on US upper level recommendations taking up to 1g per day is still fine, however it depends on your body tolerance and previous intake (as for some 5-10g could be still normal), especially if your body needs it for optimum health and to meet stresses or infections. Although the body's maximal store of vitamin C is largely determined by the renal threshold for blood. However if you exceed the upper limits of your body/bowel tolerance, in general any drug overdose is dangerous causing some side effects. Relatively large doses of ascorbic acid may cause indigestion, particularly when taken on an empty stomach and it can case diarrhoea. In one trial in 1936 (6g doses) toxic manifestations were observed in 5/29 adults and 4/93. Symptoms of Vitamin C overdose could include: skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, facial flushing, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep. As well as itchy skin (prurutis), dizziness and abdominal pain. It's usually advised to take smaller doses more frequently (e.g. ever hour), than larger doses in short amount of time in order to simulate endogenous production and increase your tolerance threshold.

45	1857	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/1857	While taking 1 gram or even more may not be acutely toxic as pointed out in the other answers, you should consider the question of why humans or other animals have not evolved to rid themselves of free radicals to the same degree as when one takes 1 gram or more of vitamin C. So, one can question if the naive picture of free radicals is actually correct, some recent research results suggest it may not be,  : So, it is likely harmful and you should not use it. You can also take this perspective. We don't know all the relevant facts about free radicals, the way the human body gets rid of them, all the self repair mechanisms that the body does in addition to removing the free radicals, any use of free radicals in the immune system etc. etc. The simplistic idea to just flood the body with vitamin C is not based on a deep understanding of how the body actually works. The relevant mechanisms have evolved over more than 600 million years. Now, we know that vitamin C is produced by animals themselves who don't get it in their diet. Only when the diet contains sufficient amounts of vitamin C will the production of vitamin C have stopped. But this implies that more vitamin C is not better, because otherwise our bodies would just produce vitamin C itself in addition to what we get from food. In fact, the more we get from food the harder the body will work to remove it, but that takes a bit of time and with 1 gram per day you are going to get an equilibrium situation where there is just too much vitamin C in the body. Any theoretical argument why 1 gram per day is good should be based on a deep knowledge of the relevant facts which has never been presented. To the contrary, there are only good arguments why it is harmful (in the sense of not optimal for health). But of course, one can always do clinical trials, but those that have been conducted point to harmful effects consistent with the theoretical arguments.	2015-08-12 03:32:39Z	Count Iblis	0

Another possible approach might be  .  Don't go straight from not using your voice at all to using it all day.

Unlike PET, X-ray, CT and most other scans, MRIs use the properties of body tissues in magnetic fields to produce an image. The MRI machine produces a powerful magnetic field which interacts with body tissues to produce radio waves, which are in turn interpreted by a computer to determine the location of the tissues. This does not, however, mean MRIs are completely without risk. First and foremost, an MRI machine is basically a giant magnet. If one has metal in his or her body, from a medical implant, car accident, or even an improperly done tattoo, the MRI machine can move it, potentially violently. In the case of medical implants, an MRI machine can easily destroy any electrical components.  There are a number of different reasons metal might be present in the body.  This is why MRI technologists are trained to ask, repeatedly, about any metal that may be present. In addition to metal, some MRIs involve contrast media, chemicals injected or consumed that increase visibility of certain tissues in MRI scans. These chemicals are normally removed by the body rather quickly, and except in individuals with reduced kidney function, are for the most part safe. However, there have been cases of allergic reactions and side effects.  Also, recently, questionable studies have presented possible links between gadolinium-based contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, though it was later shown that this link is only significant in patients with kidney failure. In healthy individuals, with properly-functioning kidneys, no medical implants, no improperly-done tattoos, and no metal embedded in the body, MRIs are completely safe, once or even quite often.	2015-03-31 21:31:01Z	imsodin	32

X-Ray radiation is harmful, and any unnecessary exposure should be limited. MRI works by putting the subject into a very strong magnetic field and using radiowaves to excite specific nuclei.  The potential dangers of MRI are equivalent to the dangers of strong magnetic fields and radiowaves (and potentially any contrast medium that is used, which can cause allergic reactions).  Due to the strong magnetic field you need to avoid bringing any metal objects near the MRI, they will be attracted by the magnet and become dangerous projectiles.	2015-03-31 20:46:23Z	Mad Scientist	27

16	313	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/313	Most kidney stones (~80%) are calcium stones, and the majority of those are primarily composed of calcium oxalate. Oxalate (C O ) is a dianion that combines with divalent cations such as magnesium and calcium. The magnesium salt is much more soluble than the calcium salt. Because these cations compete for binding to oxalate, both lower magnesium levels and higher calcium levels will tend to cause precipitation (movement out of solution into crystalline form) of calcium oxalate. When this happens in the urine in large enough quantities, it can form “stones.” As introduced by the OP, doctors have historically advised patients who have demonstrated a propensity toward calcium oxalate stone formation (or, more generically: kidney stones) to decrease dietary intake of calcium and oxalate.   In 1993,   dispelled the notion that a low calcium diet should be advised for these patients. They found the opposite association: higher calcium intake correlates with   stone formation (RR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.43 - 0.73). This somewhat counter-intuitive effect may be explained by the binding of calcium with oxalate in the gut, which tends to decrease oxalate absorption. The recommendation to decrease calcium intake, then, appears not to be valid.   have refined this recommendation, and it is now generally said that a   calcium intake is probably best.   Oxalate is found in  : beets, spinach, rhubarb, strawberries, nuts, chocolate, tea, wheat bran, and all dry beans (fresh, canned, or cooked), excluding lima and green beans. This has largely been a “seems like it should work” approach rather than data-driven. In fact,   have not shown an association between oxalate intake and stone formation.   The   also looked at other correlations between stone formation and dietary components. Animal protein was directly correlated with increased risk of stones, whereas potassium and fluid intake were correlated with decreased risk.   The   in this area that I’m aware of was published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease in 2014 and compared the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)-style diet with a low-oxalate diet for prevention of stones. Their reasoning is nicely summarized in the abstract: The DASH diet was, as its name suggests, developed as a tool to mitigate hypertension, but it has been used as a sort of paradigm “healthy diet” in trials of a variety of interventions. It is, as described in the paper above, high in fruits and vegetables, moderate in low-fat dairy products, and low in animal protein. The high fruit and nut content may be expected to increase urinary oxalate, but these foods also tend to be high in magnesium and citrate, both of which are inhibitors of calcium stone formation. The authors collected 24-hour urine samples in participants with a known history of stones and randomized them to a DASH diet vs a low-oxalate diet. They found that urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate (a measure of tendency to form calcium oxalate stones) was decreased in the DASH group compared to the low-oxalate group. This occurred despite a trend toward   oxalate excretion in that group. The authors posit that this may have been due to the increased urinary pH and concentrations of citrate, magnesium, and potassium, all of which tend to decrease stone formation. There are not solid data supporting a low oxalate diet for stone prevention. Other dietary factors that are probably helpful include: normal calcium intake; high intake of fluid, magnesium, and potassium; low animal protein.    	2015-04-04 07:32:36Z	Susan	10

Few things that I learned (in addition to Susan's answer): -drinking enough fluids seems to be the most important thing for prevention -"Sodium, often from salt, causes the kidneys to excrete more calcium into the urine. High concentrations of calcium in the urine combine with oxalate and phosphorus to form stones. Reducing sodium intake is preferred to reducing calcium intake." -reduce oxalate intake.

So cause of it should be always determine by a doctor (ophthalmologist). Abnormal eye floaters are associated with bleeding in the vitreous from diabetic retinopathy, retinal tears, retinal detachment or large degrees of nearsightedness. If floaters are accompanied by flashes of light or a loss of side vision, seek medical advice immediately. Most eye floaters decrease/reduce in size on their own due to absorption through the natural processes within the eye. The brain also adapts to the floaters, teaching the eyes to become less aware of them. With age almost everyone has it, but some are more aware than the others. There are no safe and proven methods to cure in both safe and effective way, however appropriate anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics prescribed by your doctor could reduce the number of white blood cells which are results of inflammation are common types of cellular material causing eye floaters. No other medications or eye drops have been proven effective in the treatment of eye floaters. The vitreous itself can also be surgically removed by  . It removes the actual vitreous from the eye, eliminating the eye floaters in the process, but it also increase risk of retinal detachment or cataract, so surgery should only be used as a treatment for eye floaters in extreme cases.

Some health professionals believe that certain nutritional supplements and lifestyle (e.g. reducing stress) changes may help get rid of eye floaters as well as certain herbs, vitamins and odine-containing products have been touted as effective in decreasing eye floaters (none of these have been proven effective in clinical trials).

In the past 10-15 years, thinking on calcium supplementation has shifted significantly. In 2001, a   made the recommendation that calcium should be supplemented to maintain daily intake 1000 - 1500 mg/day in older adults. The reasoning behind this was that calcium is crucial for maintaining bone mass, which tends to deteriorate during the aging process, leaving this group at increased risk for fractures. The panel acknowledged that most older adults do not obtain this amount of calcium from their diet; they therefore suggested supplementation to this level.  
Since the NIH recommendation in 2001, several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have called into question the efficacy of calcium supplementation to prevent fractures. Although  , the data suggested that hip fractures, which cause the most significant morbidity and mortality,  . 
In addition to questions about efficacy, concerns have been raised about   in those receiving calcium supplements, especially women.

Calcium supplementation has questionable efficacy for reducing clinically important fractures, and there is evidence to suggest that it may increase cardiovascular risk. Because of these factors, large groups of smart people who spend their lives analyzing epidemiological data ( : the  ) do not recommend calcium supplementation for primary prevention.

6	478	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/478	In the blister shown, the likelihood of rupture is decreased because of the thickness of the epidermis on the palm of the hand, so you can leave it alone until the underlying area re-epithelializes. You'll know this is happening because of the decreased pain and the slow reabsorption of the fluid. Eventually you will just peal it off what's left of the blister, finding clean new skin underneath. But this is a great starting point for an answer about the treatment of blisters in general: is it better to leave them alone, drain the fluid, or de-roof them (take the top of the blister off)? There is   of disagreement about what constitutes the optimal treatment of blisters. Some background might be in order. Blisters form when the upper layers of the epidermis separate from the lower layers, usually at the level of the stratum spinosum. At that level, the cells (because of proximity to the dermis, which contains the capillaries) have moisture in and between them. When the separation occurs,   fluid from the stratum spinosum oozes unopposed into the space between the layers, and a blister forms. The fluid, similar to plasma, contains molecules which may promote the rapid division which takes place in the stratum basale.  This then differentiates into the upper layers of the epidermis and healing by new skin formation. The   fluid is a very rich and inviting growth medium for bacteria. For this reason, some people think it should be removed. The denuded skin underneath has lost some of it's protection against infection. For this reason, some think the blister should be left intact. Between these two extremes are those who favor drainage of the fluid leaving the cover intact. To my thinking (and training), this is the worst option. Poking a hole in the blister, no matter how cleanly it's done, will leave a point of entry for bacteria (it doesn't take much). The bacteria will flourish in the moisture (which will still seep into the space) under the roof of the blister, protected from being washed away. This may (and often does) lead to an infection of the wound. It's much better to prevent infection than to treat it.  The reasoning of either of the other camps is more supportable. I favor leaving the blister intact as long as possible, giving the underlying wound time to form new stratified protective epidermalis. Treatment by people in this camp consists of carefully cleaning and disinfecting the surface of the blister and the surrounding skin, and covering it loosely with protective padding, usually gauze, then wrapping the entire thing with gauze wrap. The patient is instructed to check the blister daily; if it "pops" or becomes cloudy, the roof must be removed (most people prefer to have this done by a doctor or nurse), the area cleaned to remove any bacteria which might have entered, and a sterile dressing (over a light application of an antibacterial cream) reapplied, and changes daily until healed. The opposite camp reasons that the blister will break anyway, so get it over with and get the sterile dressing on, then clean and redress (with a light application of an antibacterial cream) daily. Also, if the blister is tense, it may be impeding healing of the base by decreasing blood flow. The problem with this approach is that it hurts more than leaving it alone, and the risk of infection is still greater than if the blister is intact. Many studies have been done to try to determine the best approach. Common sense plays a role. If the blister is very delicate (as in a large, tense and fragile blister of a burn), or if it looks unstable, I'll remove the roof of the blister. If I think it can be preserved for even one or two days, I'll leave it on. Every day it's left on without infection is a day of healing and decreased pain as new skin is made. From one paper: From a pain point of view: The common sense comes in with type, size, and location of blister, reliability of care by the patient or their family, location or level of activity likely to cause rupture, or in the case of hikers' blisters (and others away from medical care), what the best model is to prevent infection while still using the involved area if necessary. Also changing the scene are the new available protective dressings of deroofed blisters that allow moist healing, non-occlusive protection and visibility of the underlying skin.

5	7048	https://health.stackexchange.com/a/7048	First of all, it's typically liver and the kidneys responsible for removing unwanted chemicals from the body, not the immune system. It should be noted that liver and kidneys  . They have evolved to let some chemicals pass, react some chemicals etc. But there is plethora of compounds that had so little influence on evolutionary process, that we're not ready to handle them, since not being able to handle them was not selected against in the process of evolution. Not sure what breaking down exactly means here, but certainly there are some compounds that can get stuck in the body, notably heavy metals. Those and some others accumulate in the body, possibly but not necessarily causing harm in the future. Let's have some examples: Bioaccumulation is a process where organism (eg. you) absorbs certain chemical compound at faster rate than it excretes or processes it, which is probably what you meant by " ". See bellow some examples of such accumulation. Remember that the compound to be accumulated doesn't need to be exactly toxic, but as the poison is in the dose, as long as you accumulate something, it eventually   became toxic, should it even be water. Silver is a heavy metal and was used as disinfection in the first half of 20th century . Silver accumulates in the human body, causing  . This often happens to people who adhere to so-called "alternative medicine", which includes promoting silver suspension as a cure to all kinds of diseases. Lead is more dangerous than silver and is recognised as  . I will defer listing of other  . As I said in the introduction, evolution didn't prepare liver and kidneys for many chemicals. Sometimes the attempt to react them starts the toxic reaction itself and it would be better if the chemical stayed in blood as-is and was excreted in urine. Such event is a type of  , toxification can generally occur anywhere, not just liver. Methanol is known as possible toxic component that can accidentally occur in alcoholic beverages. Methanol shares toxicity properties with ethanol, however on top of that, it is metabolized into formic acid in the liver. This is why, if there are no better alternatives, ethanol can be administered to prevent further methanol poisoning since it occupies the liver and therefore stops the toxification process. Bear in mind that this only works before the methanol was already turned into formic acid. Apart from accumulating, arsenic also is oxidated in body which produces much more toxic arsenic (III) oxide which is the famous deadly poison.	2016-06-09 14:55:30Z	Tomáš Zato	2
