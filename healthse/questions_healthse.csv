15473	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/15473/can-diabetes-relieve-symptoms-of-hemophilia	Can diabetes relieve symptoms of hemophilia?	This question can be seen silly, but I wondered about this question for several years. I learned that diabetes make our blood so sticky that it can block blood flows of capillary vessels. Then, what happens if a hemobohilia patient with diabetes accidently cut his (because there are few female hemophilia patients) toe's skin with a cutter,  paper or glass fragment? Does the sticky blood caused by diabetes help stopping bleeding the area?  Yeah, I know that blood coagulation factors like pibrin are the primary factors for stopping bleeding, but I want to know the effects of sticky blood caused by diabetes on cut area. P.S. Sorry for poor English.-	2018-03-01 02:40:50Z	KYHSGeekCode	0	0	diabetes

I've noticed this happening randomly throughout my entire life. Other links list anything from lymph node problems, to muscle strains, to tumors.

I think I've noticed it more when yawning at weird angles. Yawning when my head is turned far to one side, or yawning when I'm hunched down, etc.  It feels like a spasm of sorts.

15440	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/15440/does-this-strategy-for-healing-from-the-flu-faster-have-potential	Does this strategy for healing from the flu faster have potential?	I get the flu several times a year and am trying to identify a strategy where I can recover from it quicker, with less damage to my time at work. I've identified three main phases of the disease. Here are my observations and questions regarding this issue.  O1. Phase 1. Starts bad for a few days, but then goes into just unpleasant for about a week. So long as I take care of myself, I can work during the unpleasant period.  O2. Phase 2. Sick, cannot work, feel very bad, need to stay home whenever possible and focus on taking care of myself.  O3. Phase 3. Coughing phase, coughs can be suppressed by taking care of myself. Feels like phase 1, except for the coughing.  O4. Taking care of myself is about things like clothing warm, drinking hot liquids, etc.  O5. Coughs happen in all phases, only in the last one they keep happening regularly no matter how much effort is made to avoid them.  O6. Feeling better means the body has now overcome the disease and is now in the process of removing the disease from the body  O7. It seems the   (search for 'Relieving a Cough')  O8. Coughing can be suppressed. One of the reasons to do this is that it can cause damage to the throat, potentially feeding the disease. Apart from being really unpleasant.  O9. Coughs be triggered very easily. By opening the mouth, pushing out some air and letting go. Wait 5 seconds and the body will produce a normal coughing fit.  O10. Coughs produce nasal material, how to deal with that and other aspects of dealing with matters of the flu are out of scope for this question. Q1. The point of this is to discover a general pattern, not just describe my personal experience. Otherwise any advice I get here won't be of any use. So if I made mistakes here, please correct me.  Q2. Does this mean there is a certain amount of disease that needs to be gotten rid of. Requiring a certain amount of coughing, regardless of suppression.  Q3. Can a higher coughing rate result in a quicker removal of all the diseased material?  Q4. If done properly, can maintaining a higher/tolerable level of coughing result in a quicker healing of the disease?-	2018-02-26 14:27:21Z	MrFox	-1	0	influenza, cough, cure

Couple weeks ago i went to the shower, after i went out of the shower i started to have pain in My lower stomach, i knew it had something to do with pooping, anyways, the pain got worse, i went in the bathroom and tried to poop, the pain got so Bad to the point it was all over my body, i tried to puke doing the 2 fingers in throat thing, didnt do anything But put pressure in My head, i was starting to pass out, (first Time having this), So i called out my mom and she helped Me to lay down as she was calling the ambulance, the medics got here But by the Time they were here, the pain, and the passing out already went away, i was in a normal state i'd say. i'm not sure what the. Medics did to Me, they checked my pulse from my Arm i think, and took little bit of blood from my finger, they didn't say that what was wrong, mainly because nothing was wrong i guess. After all that, i've had panic attacks, alot of stress, and anixiety, my first panic attack i think it was when i was using the computer in the middle of night, (usually what i do in the weekends), it started out if i remember, as me feeling like my heart would Skip beats, and My chest felt Bad, didn't hurt, But felt bad, like i couldn't breathe, this only made Me only worried and of course i did the worse thing, look up answers from the INTERNET. My state only got worse because most of the answers were linked to an heart attack, which at the Time i believed in. I started to shake alot and still after an hour, i felt discomfort in My chest, i was about to wake up my parents But it's not what i did, however, i slept downstairs in the couch. Few weeks later after nothing really happend, i had an panic attack, out of nowhere, even though i know its an panic attack, i have no control over it whatsoever. And after that, every Day, i had anixiety, to this point im typing about to have an panic attack because i am worried. I don't know if i should Ask my mother to visit the doctor to check if there was something wrong with my heart, everyday i try to feel my pulse, usually when i inhale my beat gets faster, when i exhale it feels like it skips a beat which always gets Me worried, and further to the panic attack, there are couple things which help Me to relax, the best are, masturbation, and taking a shit. (Excuse my Language, But it's the thruth.) After the ambulance stuff, i feel like everything in My way of thinking has changed, i feel like i've gotten mentally weaker, although i'm not depressed for sure.  However i've lost my motivation to things i used to do, like gaming.  It's Been many weeks but im still having bad anixiety-	2018-02-23 16:37:41Z	Niko	0	0	health-education

[closed]	I suspect it could be a methyl salicylate reaction, what is the best way to treat it - like sunburn? I used a mixture of 2/3 [Rubbing Alcohol with Wintergreen] and 1/3 [Glycerine] on Tuesday night (68 hours ago) as a massage aid on my right shoulder, neck and chest, also rubbing down my arm to my elbow.  About 3 hours later I woke with a tight feeling in these areas, and could feel the skin was rough. I washed the skin well and went back to bed, no pain, and no real discomfort preventing sleep. However the skin got steadily more dry and flaky and has turned a burgundy red especially round the neck and in the creases of the inner elbow. This morning it had started peeling like sunburn, and it continues to feel dry and wrinkly.  The colour is not like normal sunburn, more red-wine coloured rather than brown/red. More detail in case this is useful --> I have been putting an aqueous hand-cream moisturizer on it, as well as an oil balm for burns and essential balm too.  I saw another post on St/Ex, and think that raw coconut oil might be an idea, except it will come off on all my shirts.   My plan was to keep it clean and moist and just wait for all the wrinkly skin to fall off and assume that the new layers will soon be fine, as it is not painful and no sign of other side effects.  But any better ideas? That mixture is not something new to me, I have used that for massaging muscles for about 12-18 months, with absolutely no effect like this before.  But a little reading on Wikipedia has thrown some light on it.  The bottle I used had been mixed about 6 months ago, and it felt much more viscous than usual - it seems that the spirits (iso-propyl alcohol) had all evaporated.  The wintergreen did not smell any stronger than usual, but I was surprised to read that its main ingredient is methyl salicylate (powerful stuff that, I have used it on foot corns) - and although I have not had any reaction to this mix I made before, it is looking like the increased wintergreen concentration caused it. *"Salicylate sensitivity is a common adverse reaction to the methyl salicylate in oil of wintergreen; it can produce allergy-like symptoms or asthma" ... "Wintergreen oil is used topically (diluted) or aromatherapeutically as a folk remedy for muscle and joint discomfort" ...

I have two questions. 1) How can I make a high protein vegetarian diet without whey protein? Because of not using Whey protein I need to use lots of grains, nuts, and legumes. But the problem is that adding lots of them crosses the upper limit of Folate(1000 mcg) and Manganese (11 mcg). You can look at the attached diet. As you can see that the Folate and Manganese are almost touching upper limits and protein is merely 116 gms. I would like to increase protein to 140 gms without crossing those upper limits. 2) How do pro athletes control these upper limits? For e.g. Phelps used to eat 12000 calories during summer Olympics.

There are many articles about extra virgin olive oil being healthy - for example  . This implies, at least, that replacing other fats in the diet (such as butter or other vegetable oils) with olive oil is beneficial. But is olive oil also beneficial to health when consumed in larger amounts? Assuming it is not contributing too many calories and leading to an unhealthy weight. I really love the taste of olive oil, and enjoy snacks like bread with olive oil, or just using it as a dressing on lots of things. Is this healthy (because olive oil is healthy) or unhealthy (because, even though it is a "good" oil, having a larger fat intake is still bad)?-	2018-02-22 21:24:17Z	Bennet	3	0	nutrition, diet

In the past, I used to wash my hands repeatedly with soaps, detergents, etc as I used to fear that my hands are "contaminated" with germs. I used to handle my genitals using a cloth, as I used to believe that they are "dirty". I no longer behave that way but now I have developed new symptom. I constantly think that I have said something which I haven't and I fear that I have revealed my own secrets by saying things which I am not supposed to say. OCD is making me think that I have said something that I should not say and keep secret. I have been taking antidepressants like Escitalopram and Dosulepin Hydrochloride for almost one year, but I haven't seen much improvement. This is very annoying and frustrating. I obviously do not want to say something that I am not supposed to say. Please give some advice. I really need help.-	2018-02-22 12:34:00Z	Ren	0	0	ocd

15399	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/15399/why-is-the-cost-of-health-care-so-high	Why is the cost of health care so high? [closed]	Can someone explain in simple but very concrete terms why medical services cost so much in the US? By cost, I am referring here to the medical fees being charged prior to any adjustments or reimbursements by the insurance. I understand it takes many years of hard work to become a doctor and they deserve to be remunerated for that hard work. I really do. I do get that medical students come out of school with massive debts as well. I do understand there are significant costs in operating medical facilities, purchasing high-end medical equipment, running a medical staff, and being insured against law suits perhaps. With a stretch of my imagination, I may see how all this adds up so that a visit to the doctor is charged for $100-$200 even though the actual interaction with the doctor + nurse is usually on the order of 10 minutes per patient.  10 minutes for a few hundred $ = one hour for a couple of thousands $ to cover the salary of the medical staff, the rent, and amortizing the cost of medical equipment. That seems very high to my intuition but I can at least make some sense of it. But then on top of the visit cost, there are often "extra" costs that seem completely disproportionate with what is being done. From random personal experience:  - a hospital charging ~$20 for one pill of ibuprofen  - a dermatologist charging an extra ~$150 for ~10 second procedures such as spraying nitrogen on a foot wart  - a few hundred bucks for spending less than a minute taking a skin sample for a biopsy (charge for the biopsy itself separate)  - a visit to the ER for a very minor injury resulting in one stitch point on a finger and a medical bill >$1,500   What is the reasoning behind these charges? Could someone perhaps break down in simple concrete numbers the operating expenses of, say, a medical office, and a hospital and help me understand how this explains why an ibuprofen pill costs $20 in a hospital or why spraying nitrogen for 5 seconds costs ~$150 extra?-	2018-02-21 07:53:05Z	Lolo	3	0	medical-billing

I managed to hold it for almost 2 minutes, but after a bit more than 1 minute, I already felt a strong need to exhale some of the air. At the same time, I did not feel like I had to inhale again though. I ended up with two possible explanations:  At the beginning, I took a deep breath of air which was about 20 C in temperature. After this one minute in my lungs, the air warmed up (I assumed it warmed up to 35 C). For the sake of simplicity, I calculated with the ideal gas law that the pressure in the lung would increase by about 5%. Ok, this is why I had to release some air. But wait...  From what I learned about physiology, I know that our body has certain chemoreceptors to determine the oxygen saturation in our blood. And there are such chemoreceptors for carbon dioxide as well. The concentration of CO2 in my blood reached a certain threshold and I experienced this strong need to exhale. Can anybody of you confirm one of these theories?

Omega-3 is generally found in foods like walnuts, fish, etc. It is generally believed that omega-3 promote cognitive health, memory, and brain function. However, I am quite shocked to read a recent article which consisted of a study that was cited in it. This study claims that omega-3 does NOT improve cognitive abilities, memory, or brain function as commonly believed by several health experts. The study was published on well-known news service called "CBS News". The link to this study can be found here:- Another study which was also published at the CBS News also found that consuming Omega-3 supplements provided no mental or cognitive benefit:- THE STUDY CONTRADICTION These studies contradict other studies that claim that omega-3 might provide benefits when it comes to cognitive abilities or memory. Some of these studies are here:- See consumption of walnut and improvement of brain memory:- NOTE: These studies contradict other studies that claim that consumption of omega-3 can lead to improvement in cognitive functionality and memory, and one may argue that the difference between these two studies is that one study was conducted on older adults, while the other one was conducted on young adults and we may conclude that omega-3 works in younger adults but not in older adults. However, this does not explain why the age factor would influence the effectiveness of omega-3 on memory or cognitive health. Could someone provide some insight?

I'm interested in studying medicine in the future and this question is really bothering me. So most sources would say that Cardiac Arrest occurs when the heart 'stops functioning normally' and hence cannot pump blood effectively to our organs, including the brain which causes us to lose consciousness and breathing. We also know that a defibrillator cannot be used to restart a heart that has no rhythm, only to reset a chaotic one. So why then, is an AED useful if cardiac arrest causes the heart to stop? (assuming that that's what happens during cardiac arrest...) Does the rapid CPR cause it to start having some sort of rhythm again? Or is it that cardiac arrest actually doesn't STOP the heart completely, but the slightest ventricular fibrillation could cause oxygen deficiency in the brain and cause us to lose consciousness? -	2018-01-28 01:44:39Z	Michael Cai	1	0	cardiology, cpr

There is plenty of wildlife around here, and thus considerable records of rabies incidents transmitted by them. We have a cat less than a year old, and had 1st rabies vaccination. He goes out almost daily and sometimes even spends the night out. He has an independent nature, and trying to restrict him indoors is likely to cause him abandon us. I have 3 kids ages ranging from 3 to 10. They all love to play with him. He is very playful. But he sometimes bites either as part of playing or to express displeasure, e.g., if my 3 year old held him against his will. It does not cause bleeding but it is likely to penetrate the skin. There are also rare incidences of scratching that cause bleeding. Should I have my kids have pre-exposure rabies vaccination as a preventive measure? Based on what I am reading, even if the cat is exposed, rabies would not make its way to his saliva because he is vaccinated. But then, there is the chance of his rabies vaccination did not work. Even if it did work, I assume it could be possible to carry and transmit externally, e.g., nails and teeth.  Overall, if there is 1% chance over the course of say 10 years, I would take it as a considerable chance because it is a life and death matter and we may not notice our kids exposed before it is too late. In that case, would the cost and side-effects of vaccination for kids worth it?-	2018-01-27 18:24:29Z	mehmet	5	0	vaccination
15125	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/15125/how-harmful-is-it-to-drink-a-mix-of-beverages	How harmful is it to drink a mix of beverages?	I remember a long time ago (perhaps 20 years ago) that an elementary school textbook on health said "mixing alcohol beverages exacerbates the strength of the alcohol in the drink, thereby potentially being fatal to those who drink mixed beverages." Is this actually true? To my knowledge, basic chemistry dictates that you cannot have more concentration of an element than there was before you mixed the two beverages; for instance, if you mix 100ml of beer(4.5%) and 10ml of spirits(20%), you will only have a 110ml of mixed beverage with 6.5ml of alcohol(4.5%*100+20%*10). In other words, you will have a 110ml(5.9%) drink. Which can't be that much more dangerous than drinking 100ml of beer(4.5%).  So maybe I am remembering the textbook wrongly -- maybe it said that mixing drinks leads you to drink more alcohol? Or is it true that there is a third effect going on -- maybe mixing two different drinks leads to a new, more stronger substance that is greater than the mix of the two drinks? Perhaps because different drinks have different kinds of ethanol mixed into them such that when you combine the two there is a sort of alchemy that makes two seemingly harmless drinks into a sip of poison?

Nothing trendy, just cutting back on prepared and processed foods and most importantly: portion sizes. 5 weeks ago I started a strength training program. Progressive overloading using compound barbell exercises: back squat, press/bench press, and deadlifts. I've never felt stronger! The thing that's confusing me is that the scale is no longer changing. I feel like I'm eating pretty well, lots of fibre, fruits, and proteins. A   less carbs than I used to eat. Is this adage of "muscle weighs more than fat" actually true? And is it keeping my body weight around the same mark because of it? I'm lifting some seriously heavy weights at 5 weeks for a novice -- I'm 5'9" 202lbs and yesterday I squatted 195, benched 175, and deadlifted 215. Today is a rest day and tomorrow I'll be adding 5lbs to each (hence the progressive overloading). I can't tell if I'm still eating too much since my target weight is definitely under 200 at my height and body type. But I've never done strength training so I don't know how much muscle mass will change my expectation of a target weight because my previous experience was as a lean, aerobically fit twenty-something.-	2018-01-25 13:16:59Z	armadadrive	2	0	weight-loss, weightlifting

While this sounds amazing and more human studies are needed,  I feel (I am not sure exactly) that the 16:8 intermittent fasting pattern (16 hours fasting and 8 hours of feeing time daily) has had some research done on it, but yet again, mostly non-scientists propagate the idea. I am looking less for other/new evidence of fasting's health benefits, but rather for science-backed conclusions. I believe we should be able to gather the evidence and implement it correctly.

I have already asked the question on Quora in the past, yet I have not received satisfactory answers. See the link  . I'd like to consume miso soup often, however, the dashi for the soup (Japanese broth, the basis of many Japanese soups and sauces) is made from boiled kombu seaweed, which is very high in iodine.  I have read that if one pre-soaks kombu in water it removes a lot of iodine, yet does not comprise the taste much, however   (e.g. use kombu 2x10 cm long, boil  for 20 seconds - this will be approximately 60% of your iodine daily intake). Also, the Japanese often eat tofu and other foods that contain several chemicals that suppress the high iodine intake, though, again, no real numbers.  Of course, the iodine concentration in such broth strongly depends on the kombu used, the length of boiling etc., yet I believe there must be some average values one can take into consideration in order to maintain thyroid health.-	2018-01-22 14:10:09Z	Fipah	2	0	thyroid, hyperthyroid, hypothyroid, iodine

The story is this: my grandmother became genuinely allergic to most foods and suffered massive immunosuppression, which led her to seek advice from Mayo Clinic, and after extensive testing finding nothing, she was sent home in critical condition eating potatoes and gluten-free flours. She tried 500 "alternative" things, and eventually claims that holding cans of vitamins or foods in her hand will strengthen her grasp if she needs to take them or weaken her grasp if she doesn't need them. She has recovered amazingly over the past few years, and now has convinced half of the extended family that this technique is true, which puts a lot of pressure on the three unbelieving M.D's or Ph.Ds in the family (myself included) to explain why this doesn't work. Their theory is that "frequency" in the vitamin or food translates to your body, which responds in kind with strength or no strength. I have never tried blinding her to what food or vitamin she was holding, as she is resistant to testing that because she might take something she doesn't need or is allergic to.

Are any typical 3D printed (  3D printer) materials, such as ABS or PLA (or slightly more exotic ones, such as kevlar, fibreglass, or carbon fiber), safe for implantation in the human body? Or in medical terms, are they biocompatible (biofunctionality is not topical for this question)? If not, why not? If most of them are safe, then please explain which ones are NOT safe. Highly relevant, and perhaps even more interesting is: Are there any peer reviewed medical papers that have investigated what materials are safe for implantation in the human body? A paper which answers this unambiguously would be the ideal answer to this question. Another concern is if the process of 3D printing itself adversely influences the properties of the material in the context of implantation applications. I've tried to determine the answer to this question myself, but I cannot find any papers or studies which answer it. I can easily find that ABS plastic is "non-biodegradable", but I suppose the issue of adverse host responses is more crucial, e.g. causing inflammation or it being a bacterial growth substrate to promote infections seems like plausible concerns. I'm sure there might be other dangerous complications too, which I'm not aware of. I found a paper dealing with corrosion issues for implantable metals: DOI: 10.1089/end.1997.11.383 I found a paper dealing with silicone-urethane being prone to breakdown: DOI: 10.1021/ma301965y I found a paper describing the properties and history of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which appears to be commonly used as implants:  DOI: 10.1109/EEIC.2005.1566331 By extension, a 3D printer using UHMWPE might be safe, barring any adverse chemical or mechanical issues as a result of the 3D printing process itself. However, it is not clear to me if any 3D printers can actually reliably print UHMWPE. Furthermore, it is unclear if UHMWPE is a sane choice, as it appears to be useful in applications where strength is required, such as for joints. What about other applications where load bearing properties are not required (e.g. a simple enclosure for implantable electronics)? I'm aware that titanium appears to be frequently used for implants, and while titanium 3D printers do exist, they are beyond the scope of this question. The valid context is extrusion based 3D printers in the sub $10,000 range (arbitrarily chosen to make the question avoid being tagged as "too broad").-	2017-12-27 16:15:34Z	AlphaCentauri	1	0	surgery, implant, biochemistry, prosthesis-prosthetic

I have been searching for analysis & preferable scientific review of Chinese medicinal treatment of psychological disorders... in particular anxiety. Detail: Passing by, I walked into a Chinese Medicine shop yesterday for the first time in my life & enquired about chinese treatment for anxiety. The Dr.Wang behind the counter asked me to show her my tongue, which I did. All it took was a second for the spectacled doctor to inspect from a distance of about 5 feet & diagnose that I had poor liver function & blood circulation, particularly to the head. Curious, I asked her for the treatment & she prescribed two medications. I do not have the name of the medicines (everything was in Chinese), however, the dosage was interesting, one to be taken three times a day, eight tablets at a time. The other one is 10 tablets, twice daily. The first prescription is suppose to last 9 days at a cost of 25 & I presume it needs to be carried on for a few weeks atleast. This has been on my mind since & to be clear, while I am very intrigued to the point of going for it, if only to see the results after a few weeks, however, I am conscious that this is not a cheap treatment & coming from a family of doctors, I have been quite sceptical of Chinese, Arabian, Ayurvedic, Eastern etc treatments. However, reading online, there appears to be some posts on people finding relief through this treatment where Western treatments have failed. So, is there any study / research / literature on these Chinese treatments, relating to psychological / psychiatric treatments?

My current understanding of genetics is at the American Advanced Placement(AP) level(of high school advanced level). I studied Biology by Neil Campbell and Jane Reece and Khan Academy up till now.  Would you recommend a better book? Or a companion book to read with this? All suggestions are welcome, Im yet to go book shopping, so Ill check those out. Since it will be some months before I actually start medical school, I currently do not have this book in my hand and I wish to know if you feel, from personal or shared experience, that this books assumes understanding of genetics at a level beyond that taught in Biology by Campbell and Reece, ie beyond my current understanding, then please suggest a bridging book.  Thanks.  P.S.- I prefer friendly, simple narrative books like the Campbell and Reece kind, instead of books written like a code that needs to be deciphered ie super stiff language.

This results in the development of repulsive forces that separate the protein matrix, uncoil the filaments, and expose more water binding sites, hence increasing the hydration level of skin.[12]  " That is a very serious health concern since it's in alot of shampoo and soaps, there is also alot of variation of Lauryl-sulfate based/similar substances.

[closed]	I am a 24 year old male who has suffered extremely uncomfortable symptoms from GERD for the past four years. My condition has resulted in me suffering asthma-like symptoms often during the day, and sleep apnea is a common occurance for me most nights due to reflux irritating my breathing, and uncomfortable gas pockets getting trapped in my lower esophagus.  I underwent an endoscopy last year which found ulceration of my esophagus due to the chronic reflux I am experiencing. I have issues with my breathing causing air to suck into my esophagus and stomach. I believe (though it has not yet been confirmed by a medical professional) this is due to the inflammation of my esophagus. I have a slight lumbar lordosis caused by an anterior pelvic tilt from sitting around a lot in my teenage years. When I suck in my lower abs very hard while stood up, correcting my posture, this sometimes provides temporary relief.     and antacids such as   have been unsuccessful in treating my condition, and the reflux persists almost as badly as if I wasn't taking them.     I am usually strictly vegan, but I am prepared to switch my diet to anything that will help relieve my symptoms. I already avoid alcohol, coffee, spicy and oily foods and do not smoke. I am not in particularly bad shape (6'3, 93kg muscular build) My research has lead me to some people claiming that a prolonged fast (3 - 5 days) may be effective in relieving GERD symptoms.

14457	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/14457/why-is-treating-hepatic-vein-injuries-so-difficult	Why is treating hepatic vein injuries so difficult?	I've read a few ER room stories on quora where trauma surgeons would dictate their real life accounts. One of them said about a accident victim who was very much alive , conscious and talkative. Upon operating the surgeon's team found that the hepatic vein has ruptured from vena cava behind the liver. So the team decided that nothing could be done to repair that damage and save the patient's life. They stopped the life support and slowly the patient died on the table. Reading through the comments I found this passage : You remember Professor Asrat used to say that injuries to the vena cava behind the liver are when the surgeon sees God? He used to say things like that that I didnt understand. I understand now. What I fail to understand is why was this situation deemed untreatable? Especially when someone is very much alive. Why would one not try to treat it anyway regardless of success rate when the other option is definitely death of the patient? Several cases which are very likely to be fatal (cancer , HIV , ebola ) etc are treated regardless of the final outcome so what went wrong in this case?-dh774e5a285b	2017-11-24 08:39:20Z	Allahjane	1	0	liver, emergency, trauma

But I feel there is a big difference in the level of urgency between "urgent" and "emergency", with an emergency being   more urgent than something which is just "urgent", at least to my ears.  Note: I included "acute referral", mostly because it is a direct translation of the Swedish term, but it sounds really strange to me. I have never heard anyone use the word "acute" to mean "urgent".

From my fairly limited understanding, much of the time medications are said to be damaging to the liver, what is meant is that the process of breaking them down causes the formation of free radicals, which then attack the local liver cells. Is this usually the case? For example, acetaminophen (paracetamol, Tylenol, Calpol, Panadol depending on where you live) is broken down in the liver through three pathways, glucoronidation, sulfation, and a third involving the cytochrome P450 enzymes. This third pathway entails breakdown chiefly by CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 through the intermediate NAPQI, which is a strong oxidizer. Too much acetaminophen, or a little over a long period of time, leads to a buildup of NAPQI, which causes oxidation of liver cells and subsequent liver damage.  Is it the case that  , when drugs are known to cause liver damage under certain conditions (such as high dosage or extended use), it's because the drug is broken down in the liver into reactive chemical species that cause oxidative stress on the local liver tissues?-	2017-11-19 19:29:00Z	TheEnvironmentalist	2	0	medications, liver, drug-metabolism, oxidative-stress

Hyperventilation can lead to cerebral hypoxia, as hypocapnia (reduced CO2 in blood) causes vasoconstriction in the brain along with alkalosis which impairs the ability of the blood to deliver oxygen (Bohr effect). This is all pretty understandable and there's an extremely detailed breakdown of the mechanics and effects of hyperventilation in  . As a result of the hypoxia and alkalosis, hyperventilation can have some pretty psychedelic effects (tingling, numbness, spasms, confusion, disassociation, hallucinations, generally altered state). Some New Age practices take advantage of this (under the term "breathwork"[1] ), with a whole layer of pseudoscience and/or mysticism on top, but I've tried it once and the effect is real: hyperventilating for that long produces some crazy results! Hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia is "well tolerated"[2] but the only concrete info I can find about cerebral hypoxia is that you lose consciousness about 15 seconds after oxygen supply to brain is interrupted, and brain damage can start 4-6 minutes after that. On the one hand, hyperventilation won't even come close to cutting off oxygen supply. On the other hand, these practices can keep this up for an hour. The widely reported " " has caused injuries and fatalities, but has components that make it more dangerous - strangulation, pseudo-Valsalva maneuvers, and holding your breath. How dangerous is this? From what I can tell, mild hyperventilation can cause noticeable mental effects without being dangerous (common in panic attacks for instance). But what if you take it really far? What are some sane limits on duration, and how could you identify that you're getting into dangerous territory? [1]   and  [2] Via citation   (sorry): Laffey JG, Kavanagh BP (2002). "Hypocapnia". N.

It prevents my skin from peeling and normally it is extremely analgesic (goes from bad pain to 0 in minutes and then stays 0 as it heals). But one time when I was making myself some fried eggs, not only did I burn the eggs a little (which I think was due to me using butter and it was the butter that burnt, not the eggs) but I also burnt 1 of my fingers. Now I have had burns on my fingers before and aloe always helped. But this first degree burn was worse. Cold water would only work temporarily. Aloe was the same way, it is wet and thus I felt the cooling of the burn which took the pain down but only temporarily. I did not feel that analgesia I normally do from aloe. I was crying because of this. Nothing I did helped for any more than a few minutes. I just had to deal with it and it was at least 10 minutes that I was in pain from the burn. Why was this first degree burn not helped by aloe any more than by cold water whereas all the burns before then had significant analgesia from aloe? I used the same aloe plant for all my burns (a small aloe plant that I think has now died(the burn was long before the supposed death of the aloe plant I used for burns)).-	2017-11-16 01:58:01Z	Andrew Brēza	1	0	burns, aloe-vera

When you do cardiovascular exercise for an extended period of time, the typical process (pretty much as roughly speaking as possible) is: You can make the argument that there are some exercise routines that swap step 2 for "Get to the point where you can't do the exercise anymore and stop there," in which case the decision to stop wouldn't exactly be a conscious decision.  I suspect, however, that even with an exercise routine like that, if someone pointed a gun to your head and told you to keep exercising, then you could probably keep going.  Those mental barriers are just too strong: at some point, your brain will say "No more!" before your body does and you will stop prematurely. In stories that I write, I occasionally run into the scenario of characters in a "run for your life" sort of situation, where something is perpetually on their tail that they need to escape from.  They can't slow down or stop: they have to go as fast as they can for as long as they can in order to escape danger.  In this sense, it's like the hypothetical I described: a gun is basically being pointed to their heads and they're being forced to keep running.  At this point, mental barriers are thrown out of the window in order to prevent premature death, so they're not going to get in the way. But something will eventually.  At some point, the hero will collapse, and I'm interested in knowing what's going on in the body when that point finally happens.  Do the muscles cease their functionality due to a deficiency of ATP?  Do you briefly black out or pass out due to lack of oxygen (or rather, a surplus of CO2) being distributed through the body?  Or is it   going to be a mental barrier that inevitably causes collapse (in other words, will something kick in the brain before other parts of your body fail that will force you to stop running regardless of external stimuli)? We can assume that prior to the extended sprint, the character is well-rested and hydrated.  If different cardiovascular exercises are expected to yield different results, we can limit things to just running, since that's what I'm primarily interested in.  Also, since many people can jog pretty much indefinitely provided the jog is slow enough, we can assume that the character is continuously exercising at the peak of his or her capabilities.-	2017-11-21 02:13:35Z	ArbitraryRenaissance	3	1	exercise, muscle, fatigue, heart

When I asked people I know what they do during nosebleeds and what they know, most of them tilt their heads back and put cotton tampons or handkerchiefs in the nostrils. None of them have suffered any trauma caused by swallowing blood, and as far as I know, it's rare for seriously bad effects to occur like this. There is an infamous photo of a very large branching blood clot ( ) which is used to scare kids about nosebleeds, but it seems to be an exceptionally rare occurrence. At least that's so uncommon that I've only seen that in this one picture. One common thought that goes through minds of people I've talked to seems to be "Blood loss is a thing, and I'm losing blood, so I better swallow it back into myself". I'd like to ask the more knowledgeable folk on this site: Is swallowing own blood from nosebleeds harmful, neutral or beneficial?

14282	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/14282/how-are-sensitivity-specificity-determined-for-tests-in-mental-health	How are Sensitivity/Specificity determined for tests in mental health?	Originally the question was   but I narrowed it down a bit since it seemed to be too broad.  Given that measuring Sensitivity and Specificity requires that you know in advance which people are positive or negative for some disease what's the general process if you develop a new test for a new disease where there's no existing test for the disease making it hard to actually reason about who has the disease and who doesn't. Similarily, if you have an existing test and develop a new test that is supposed to be more accurate, how are you going to tell who has the disease and who not because using the existing test to quantify that introduces "unkown" errors.  Similarily, how is this done for diseases that don't even have biomarkers available at that point. I.e. mental illnesses like depression. The way they are defined is by a set of criteria that define the illness and then people develop questionaires to screen for these mental illnesses but since the only way of knowing whether somebody actually has depression is to apply the criteria from the definition those criteria are actually what defines the test in the sense that hose criteria determine whether somebody has the disease, or not. In essence, doesn't this mean that you invent criteria based upon 'nothing' and then create a questionnaire for it but since the definition is actually arbitrary how does this gain you new insight or new information? In some sense, I could define 'hoarding' as well... 'excessively collecting/hoarding objects...' and then devise a questionaire that consisting of two questions 'do you hoard books' and 'do you hoard empty bottles' and if 80% of hoarders do one of these things I will have 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity but I might as well just use the criteria from the definition and do much better than that questionnaire.  You can't really make the argument that the criteria are set so that it fits people having the disease well... because the criteria is what defines the disease in the first place contrary to disease that are diagnosed based on an underlying known pathology and tests try to detect that pathology (or side-effects of that pathology) and the accuracy of the test depends on how good in can detect that pathology.  Some thoughts: I guess the way I'd do it is I'd just measure a lot of stuff and then see if I can find any significant correlation. Like I have 100 patients with similar symptoms and I check their blood and see that 80 of those patients have more copper in their blood than a healthy control group causing me to think that copper is involved in the pathology then I'd investigate that further and then I notice that their bodies don't process copper as they should and this sometimes causes in 90% of the people with that pathology increased copper blood levels, in 10% we don't see that and the other 10% of my patients turned out to have something that produces the same symptoms but the pathology is something completely different. So I devise a test around that that' measures elevated copper levels which 90% people (with that pathology) have but with some errors and due a cut-off level I have to put somewhere let's say I get about 88% sensitivity and 96% of specificity (because a few people have idiopathic elevated copper levels or something that produces a higher copper level). But I obviously can't really do the same for illnesses where I don't know the pathology because there's zero way of telling who has which pathology. Like depression. If I define depression as 'a.) has low mood on most of the days for at least 6 months' or similar and this is both the test AND the definition of the disorder I obviously get 100% sensitivity, but that's because the test and the definition is the exact same thing and there's no way of determining the specificity because everything that matches my criteria is by definition having this illness I just defined meaning it will match absolutely everything that provokes these symptoms regardless of the pathology so I can't really measure specificity unless I neglect the existence of other diseases producing the same symptoms, in which case I'd get both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity but this is obviously 'cheating' OR if I just define it as co-morbid to some other pathology in every case but that's basically also just a neat 'cheat'? I could then add a little extra criteria 'b.) not due to some other disorder' but this at least scientifically looks like another 'cheat' because now you don't have a test for anything anymore to begin with. You have a definition, but no test. You can't use a questionnaire anymore. -	2017-11-10 16:14:27Z	mroman	1	0	statistics, test

Vitamin K deficiency means that once injured, bleeding won't stop on its own. Not saying that all babies get bruised from birth (although some probably do). Now I know that vitamin K is injected into the foot of a newborn to prevent this unstoppable bleeding from happening.  If phenobarbital is still the necessary medication of choice, even during pregnany, this looks like dilemma. Now I also looked up if vitamin K toxicity is possible (because I know vitamin K is fat soluble and with most fat soluble vitamins, toxicity is possible be it from eating organ meats (especially liver), or from supplements. It turns out that at least with vitamin K2 (the most common vitamin K supplement), toxicity is not possible or if it is, is not feasible by taking a supplement. I was wondering if taking a vitamin K supplement will prevent a fetus from being born with vitamin K deficiency in a woman who takes phenobarbital for seizures.   -	2018-02-08 19:37:53Z	LangLangC	3	0	seizure, fetus, vitamin-k

OK to sleep?	Long plane flights carry a risk of DVT. It is easy to find advice on preventing DVT by being active: None of these mention the possibility of sleeping on the plane. Are they suggesting you should not sleep? We all lie down for 8 hours or so every night, and yes, we can toss and turn a little more freely in a real bed, but I find it hard to imagine this advice means "don't sleep, stay awake so you can walk around a lot." Further, there is a big difference between "every hour" and "every two or three hours" - and that's not counting good old "occasionally". None indicate whether wearing compression socks means it's safer to go for a longer interval between walks.  So, if a person with at least some risk factor for DVT is going on a long (11 hrs) flight, wearing compression socks, in business with a lie-flat bed, is lying flat in that bed and sleeping actually as dangerous as sitting awake in economy? What about a 13 hour flight in economy, still with the socks, is sleeping for part of that flight dangerous? This is normal sleep without the aid of Ambien or even alcohol, and thus there will be tossing and turning. Why I'm asking: I have those flights in my future and a doctor told me emphatically to get up "every hour" on the plane and walk around. I didn't think to ask about sleep time, and I have no problem getting up once an hour while awake. But this same doctor knows that I drive two to three hours to and from my appointments, and has never said to pull over the car and walk every hour during a drive. Yet DVT isn't related to altitude, just to sitting still. So I feel the "every hour" is probably a little overcareful. But I am interested in what the studies show, and specifically on the matter of sleeping, in business and in economy. I am not asking for a diagnosis or to override my doctor's advice. I just want to sanity check it since we didn't discuss economy vs business and lying down to sleep. A study showing the effects of following various advice regimens (and that includes overnight flights where people slept or stayed awake) would be great.-	2017-11-03 23:46:33Z	Kate Gregory	4	0	travel, thrombosis

I ate one dose of about 4mg (I think... I lost the label but it was from a dispensary). I am sure I did not eat any other edibles in between. There's also the factor that I now drink moderate alcohol throughout the high. But can alcohol really cause the high to be so much more delayed/prolonged? Or is it something else?  It's also very high percentage THC and almost no CBD if I remember correctly.  P.S. The amount of chocolate I eat is extremely small. I usually eat literal crumbs. And this time it was a solid 1/4th chunk of a chocolate square, but still very small. So right now my working hypothesis is that there's so much dosage in so little food that there's a high amount of randomness in how it passes through my body?

Why?	Myself, my brother, and a friend of mine all have noticed independently that our left and right eyes perceive colour differently from the other eye. As compared to my vision with both eyes open, my left eye sees things in a noticeably cooler palette while my right eye sees things in a noticeably warmer palette. This has been detectable since my early childhood, some 24 years or so, thus not a new development of any kind, at least in my case. We have each ask our relevant medical professionals why this might be throughout the years, and the answers have ranged from "I don't know" to "I've never heard of that happening." The latter I have always found a bit surprising. We wear corrective lenses for various vision issues, I assume it is related to that some how, but the mechanism in particular eludes me. I also feel like maybe this is true for everyone and we just happened to notice it. I'm not concerned that this is a big deal, and it does not bother me at this time, just curious that the three of us have had this experience without hearing about it anywhere else, and without our professionals knowing what we're talking about.-	2017-11-01 16:09:15Z	NimbleThicket	2	1	eye, vision, ophthalmology, optometry

I have recently found myself repeating a behavior that, while not concerning, is curious. I find that when laying down, either going to sleep or resting deeply, I will feel a physical compulsion to hold my breath for about 15 to 30 seconds and release it.  Compulsion might be too strong of a word, but it is in that realm - it feels like something my body wants to do rather than something I'm thinking I would like to do. It is not unpleasant and I'm not asking for a diagnosis or advice.  I can't imagine it's harmful.  The thing is, the overall experience is quite relaxing; a very pleasant sensation. In a way it seems quite similar to the exercise of clenching and releasing one's muscle in order to relax.  The main difference though, is it feels like a physical "need" (although, again, too strong of a word) rather than an entirely conscious choice. My question is:  Does anybody know what this might be described or categorized as?  I'm not looking to cure it, so to speak, but rather find something that resonates or helps explain what this is.

Ive come across   and was wondering if there are any reliable alternatives to the rather invasive treatment option, especially with the morbidity outlined in the article. Obviously, if the indications are clear there is no reason to hesitate, but especially with children their bones are not strong and such symptoms and indications are easily achieved.

I'm wondering if a serious water purifier e.g. RO + UV would be a better way to go. In this context, better means, better for the health of the human (or possibly animal) who is consuming that water. We occasionally have international guests, and sometimes they seem unhappy with boiled water as a option. Or is both boiling and purification the best way to go? There is some discussion of this on the net, but I'm looking for a detailed answer, with pros and cons. I haven't found anything like this. Also, some of the answers I've felt have been on sites which might be biased, like sites selling water purification technology. An Indian-specific answer would be ideal, but not necessary. I do know that Bombay water is supposedly very bad. I've never tested it, though. As I understand it, the main disadvantage of boiling water is that it doesn't get rid of dissolved solids and other possibly dangerous impurities. And the corresponding disadvantage of RO water purification is that it gets rid of   minerals, which is presumably bad. And it apparently possible to remineralize the water, but I don't know how much of an issue it is in practice.

In November I will be giving a short talk on Statistics to a Science group, and will be including a warning about how averages can mislead. One amusing example, from a BBC4 TV programme, is that the average number of legs in the population is about 1.998, since a few people have one or no legs, but no one has three or more. So nearly all the population has more than the average number of legs.  For a more serious example I remember from years ago reading that the average level of radioactivity  on a beach near Dounreay Nuclear Site, after a series of accidents there, was (whatever), well within safety limits. I thought then that the real danger would be intensively radioactive particles that could be ingested, but averaged out over an area would give this reassuringly safe value.

Overdose of many psychoactive drugs ( ,   and others) can cause respiratory arrest, which may lead to death. This appears in every prescribing information of said drugs, but I was unable to find anywhere if this adverse effect and the resulting death are accompanied with pain. Since opiates are administered for pain relief, perhaps the answer is no, but I wonder if anyone has a more established answer for this question.

13911	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/13911/what-are-the-effects-of-swallowing-own-blood-from-nosebleeds	What are the effects of swallowing own blood from nosebleeds?	I've seen people on the internet claim that you shouldn't tilt back your head during nosebleeds, because blood could get into your lungs or stomach. When I asked people I know what they do during nosebleeds and what they know, most of them tilt their heads back and put cotton tampons or handkerchiefs in the nostrils. None of them have suffered any trauma caused by swallowing blood, and as far as I know, it's rare for seriously bad effects to occur like this. There is an infamous photo of a very large branching blood clot ( ) which is used to scare kids about nosebleeds, but it seems to be an exceptionally rare occurrence. At least that's so uncommon that I've only seen that in this one picture. One common thought that goes through minds of people I've talked to seems to be "Blood loss is a thing, and I'm losing blood, so I better swallow it back into myself". I'd like to ask the more knowledgeable folk on this site: Is swallowing own blood from nosebleeds harmful, neutral or beneficial? I've found a question on SE about consuming blood in general, and the recommendation is against that, but in that case it's extra blood that wasn't in your own body's circulation. So this is a different question, just in case.-	2017-10-09 19:13:58Z	user1306322	2	0	blood

I was wondering what can be done to make it less off-putting, assuming one does not have paramedic equipment to hand.   Obviously there is the miniature face mask, but most people do not bring that with them. If the CPR is a two-person job, with the person pushing in charge, I could imagine telling the second person to clean the face with a tissue (assuming that starting with a delay is better than not starting) and then to breath through a second one.   I have never done CPR in a real life situation, so input from someone who has would be of particular interest.

Even apart from that, my lifestyle is far from sedentary and I do not feel any symptoms of fatigue, lethargy at all. To add more information, I do smoke, but only one cigarette a day. I control my diet and try to take more proteins than carbs. I do not eat junk at all. I also take tea everyday which boosts metabolism. The only problem I am facing is the "pot belly". A few months back, I hit the treadmill everyday and used to swim like 3 times a week, and my "pot belly" temporarily improved.

Puberty wreaks havoc on skin. There's no arguing against the mountains of empirical evidence. Acne and pimples are the most common complaint, followed by unwanted hair and armpit odors, all of which were previously absent. And this NIH academic article ( ) specifies that "Inhibition of androgen is known to promote skin wound healing" (see the abstract) - a topic with applications in both the military and regenerative medicine. "Puberty did so much to improve my skin." - said no one ever. Usually, androgens are to blame for these (in both men and women). With the massive number of problems, it's way past time for a serious health project to eliminate or neuter (pun intended) all androgen receptors in dermal (skin) cells. I have yet to find any article or scholarly research paper that names one advantageous effect that androgens have on skin - all of them are harmful. Technology developments in recent years are a gold mine of solutions just waiting to be put into practice. Different cell types have different markers, and it's easy to envision adding an inhibitor to the gene that codes for androgen receptors such that a compound that only dermal cells produce regularly binds to the inhibitor and prevents dermal cells from growing androgen receptors. While waiting for CRISPR/Cas9 to be ready, there are plenty of cell signaling based approaches. Medication that gets inside skin cells through endocytosis and prevents androgen receptors from "communicating" through blockage of enzyme cascades. Blocking 1 step in the cascade is enough to extinct the previously mentioned health problems. An even more short-term and lower-tech stopgap would be a topical that soaks down into the skin and irreversibly damages/blocks androgen receptors. Apply on face and neck to prevent acne. Apply to armpits to stop hair growth and odors. Apply to wounds to promote healing. Regularly apply anywhere else to inhibit unwanted hair growth. Topical is built to denature/inactivate permanently in highly acidic conditions to prevent unwanted side effects on accidental ingestion. The present availability of anti-androgen topicals is a joke. Most of them are prescription only. Almost all of them are specific to either men or women. None of these solutions are practical for wide-scale deployment in civilian life, first aid and emergency service, or the military.-	2017-10-04 02:18:27Z	user1258361	2	1	dermatology, genetic-engineering

We all know that humans can tolerate lower frequencies at high volumes better than higher frequencies. In fact, for particularly low frequencies, high SPL is needed just for it to be audible.  Whats the difference between low and high frequencies for the ear?  If the decibels are equal, does low frequency sound cause the same amount of total hearing damage as other frequencies? If not, how much less damage does it cause? What is the maximum safe threshold for lower frequencies?  By low frequency, I am referring to the range of 16-100Hz, which is the range of most commercial subwoofers.  I am aware of people with 150db+ car audio systems, who are not deaf or hearing impaired. With regular sound, this would be as loud as a gunshot and constant exposure will surely cause significant damage. Many people in those communities seem to think bass is safe at loud volumes. However, I have not found any research to support or counter this argument.   This is different from   because I am specifically asking the difference in hearing damage of frequencies.   It also does not account other types of hearing damage such as tinnitus.

Heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and I believe Alzheimer's as well, seem to all be the result of the body's plumbing being clogged up by fat and cholesterol deposits. Exercise, a diet low in artificial fructose, saturated fat, and trans fats, but high fiber, seems to be effective at reducing your risks. Diabetes II is the result of insulin not being effective because of inter-cellar build ups; heart disease is when your heart cannot get blood to function because of build up in the vessels that supply it. Would it be fair to categorize these health issues as different manifestations of the same disease, similarly to how we call many different kinds of cancer "cancer"?

I am on Lamotrogine (specifically in the form Epitec). Last week my dose was raised by 25mg (from 200mg/day to 225mg/day). Over the last couple of days I have developed a tic in my eyes. At first it was intermittent, but compulsive blinking spasms. Now it has settled onto the right side of my face, but have become constant. The best way I can describe the sensation is it feels like something has hold of the muscle in my cheek (Zygomaticus?) and is pulling it, causing my upper lip the rise on that side and my right eyelid to flutter down to the point of completely obscuring my vision. I have seen mentions of a couple of case studies (can't find them!) of people reporting tics. But it seems to only be a few out of the thousands who take the medication. But I know that that can not be a good representation, because often these things can go unreported. I have also checked my package insert and it mentioned nothing.

In their model, reflux leads to the presence of pepcin outside the stomach.  Exposure of the pepcin to acid then activates it and causes tissue damage.  Based on this model, they recommend consuming low-acid foods and drinking slightly alkaline water to reduce the activity of the pepcin.

Looking at the regulation, it appears that   describes the use of acidification to preserve foods, but   describes and permits the use of thermal processing as an alternative.  This would contradict the books' claim that "all" preserved foods are acidified, and it's consistent with my subjective impression that many canned foods (e.g. beans) don't seem acidic at all.

It's very likely that I will be spending most of my life in front of a computer monitor. This is necessary for my profession and the fact that improving technology requires us to look at screens more. My eyesight is near perfect and I never needed any glasses or lenses. However, I notice that all the staring at screens takes a toll on my energy during the day and I want to protect my eyes.  I have already altered the brightness/contrast and colour of my monitor. I also installed   software on my computer. My question is this: I came across computer glasses but opinions are divided and I wonder what is true. As far as I know there are two types: tinted glasses and glasses with a correction (I'm Dutch and I don't know the perfect translation for glasses with a certain "focus" or "correction". Edits more than welcome) I'm not really interested in the tinted version since I covered that with adjusting the settings of my monitor. My interest is in glasses with a low correction that cancels out or reduce staring. Is it safe to assume that glasses like these will reduce the strain on my eyes because they don't have to focus so much anymore? As I already said, the opinions are a little divided. One website is positive, another isn't. Even the answers to   say different things.

My question is, are these two intolerances actually the same thing, are they both simply related to histamine intolerances, or are they, in fact, two separate intolerances altogether?

13697	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/13697/why-does-the-price-for-a-prescription-drug-fluctuate	Why does the price for a prescription drug fluctuate? [closed]	I order a brand name prescription that has no generic, that is still under patent protection, that is not an orphan drug from a large mail order pharmacy. I have been getting this same prescription for six years. The mail order firm buys direct from the manufaturer, adding their overhead and profit to the price and then is paid by (1) my direct payment and (2) payment from my drug prescription insurer. Over the past two years (in particular) the sum of payments (from 1 and 2 above) to the mail order pharmacy has varied substantially, and inconsistently (eg. increases and decreases) from a low of $1400 to a high of $2600 for the same 90 day order. To be more specific in my question, why would a manufacturer price for a drug fluctuate as I describe. One area That I've not been able to research is if Insurances companies negotiate pricing with the manufacturer -- but if that is the significant factor -- it suggests that the negotiated pricing only holds for 90 days or so.  Any insight would be helpful. If their is a better place to ask this question, please suggest.-	2017-09-21 07:34:38Z	Stylus	1	0	medications, prescription

[closed]	I am not an orthodontist but a physicist. But while discussing a certain orthodontic technique with an experienced board-certified orthodontist (who graduated and practice in the US), it became apparent to me that the technique he was taught (and uses) is quite over-optimistic in its ignorance of the effects of elementary physical principles, which is why it almost always results in a much-less-than-ideal outcome, and it also greatly disturbs and compromises the other satisfactory elements of the bite. After thinking about the situation, I came up with a quite simple alternative technique to fully control the desired movement, without disturbing the satisfactory areas of the bite. It might be implemented with existing orthodontic devices which I am familiar with; however it may be enhanced and slightly simplified with a new auxiliary device that I have (conceptually) invented. Not being a physician, how do I publish this technique under my name? How can I patent this auxiliary device, when I did not actually built it, but only drew a sketch? Not that I try to become a millionaire, I just want to prevent others from taking over this idea and charging orthodontists/patients for using it.-	2017-09-16 19:50:04Z	rapt	2	0	dentistry, medical-device, legal

My teeth, in some parts, are impossibly yellow and do not whiten no matter what procedures have been done. I am seeking out a method to artificially whiten the yellow parts without veneers or resin put on them. In other words, if they can't be naturally whitened, I want them artificially whitened. I, however, refuse veneers because it doesn't make my teeth whiter -- it just covers the teeth and it's purely fake. I want some sort of epoxy or enamel-mimicking agent that can bind to my teeth and change the real color of the dentin to be yellow and keep it that way. Or some other scientific way of doing this without veneers, resin or implants. I refuse to believe that it's impossible to force dentin to look white. I want my teeth to be Hollywood white without veneers/dentures/etc. I would like the natural yellow color to be artificially cleaned and painted/bonded to force the color of the yellow to turn white -- not have something fake cover the natural color.

Contrary to the recent past, when high carb - low fat diets were recommended, it appears that now the opposite type diet is often being recommended.  Many doctors who have written books on the subject recommend diets high in fat and extremely low in carbohydrates, limiting them at 10% of caloric intake.  It is unclear how pragmatically one could live on just 10% carbohydrate.  The latter represents the most efficient source of energy for the body.  Athletic performance, endurance would suffer with only 10% carbohydrate.    I gather the idea of the high fat diet is to change the metabolic state of the body in a state of ketosis whereby given the absence of readily available carbohydrate fuel, the body learns how to use and burn fat for energy.  Is this process all that healthy and sustainable over the long term?

What should a vegetarian student cook and eat to avoid any significant Vitamin deficiency and to stay healthy. Please keep in mind that such a student faces money and time constraints.  The easily available options which I have found out by now are cooking rice, and maybe dal, in a rice cooker. And of course one can toast a bread and have it with butter or jam. But I am finding it very difficult to keep myself going with these options.  The common deficiency that a vegetarian faces are lack of protein and Vitamin D12. These are more or less offset by the intake of other green vegetables. But I have found out that the vegetables, which I eat, are not available in my area. So naturally I will not meet those nutrients demand of my body and in due time may develop some deficiency. I have edited my question on the advice of comments I received. I agree this question is more suitable for cooking stackexchange site but this problem faced by vegetarians has far too many health influences for it to be neglected. So I urge the reader to consider this problem as a serious one. But I understand that a non vegetarian may find it difficult to label this as a serious problem.

I've been hearing advertisements for a new fat reduction treatment called CoolSculpting, in which areas of fat are brought down to below the freezing point of fat but above the freezing point of water, causing the fat to freeze and destroy the fat cells while the non-fat cells remain unaffected. This makes me wonder, couldn't one just spend time in an icebath? Various sources spread throughout the internet, most notably plastic surgeons, answer this with the trivial, "No! The CoolSculpting device is special and safe, and any method of cryolipolysis not using the device would be dangerous!" but from a medical perspective, why not? This is the point where I explicitly say ice baths can cause hypothermia and a host of other issues, so I'm definitely not recommending it personally, but medically, wouldn't time with the torso in an ice bath, with a wetsuit/drysuit covering the legs and groin, have the same effect as CoolSculpting, but for thousands of times lower cost?-	2017-08-31 14:50:50Z	TheEnvironmentalist	3	0	body-fat, medical-device, cryolipolysis

Our doctor prescribes the same, but he is a bit different. According to him, walking only in the morning helps keeping good health.

I.e. it is (or should be) the best available schedule  . Lots of physicians follow strictly those guidelines. However considering a particular individual, you can take other variables into account, which may result in a different optimal vaccination schedule. The only information usually taken into account are diseases which result in a clear contraindication for a particular vaccination. However there are more variables with less impact on the schedule but which may relevant to (slightly) optimize the benefit-risk ratio for the individual.  For example if you have a newborn from a familiy with contact to the drug scene should clearly have a hepatitis B vaccination. However in other families there is clearly (almost) no risk that the infant comes into contact with someone having hepatitis B (for example because of the families social environment and because the infant doesn't go to a nursery), the risks of unintended side effects might be larger then the benefits. Then the doctor should explain this to the parents and also point out that the social environment and thus the risk may change if the child is at puberty and that it might be difficult to send the child to vaccination at this age... Another example would be the FSME vaccination. If a infant lives in a big city you might come to a different recommendation than for a child of a farmer family living in a FSME risky environment.  A further example is the rota virus. In this case the recommendation might be different if the mother is breastfeeding or not.  Also the timing may depend, for example if a infant is raised at home for the first three years, you might consider giving the vaccination a a bit later than for a infant which is in a nursery the whole day since month 2. So are there any books or papers which discusses those aspects of individualized optimizing the vaccination schedule in a comprehensive way supported by reliable probabilities and reasoning. Because of different available vaccines and different risks of getting infected, the answer depends on the country. In particular I am interested in Germany. But discussions based on the situation in other European countries or the US may be comparable. Where as the situation in some African countries will be very different (that's not what I want).

I got diagnosed with a blood clot after a knee surgery and now my doctor told me that I need to be taking Warfarin for 3 months. I was talking to one friend of mine, who studied medicine and he said that I should be careful eating citric foods like limes, oranges, etc. Because they can make my blood even more thinner, which can be life threatening if I get a skin cut. I like limes a lot, I probably eat like 2 or 3 of them daily, so I got concerned about this.  I also heard that warfarin can cause gastritis and a stroke as a side effect, which is pretty scary.  I tried to do a research online on that but I couldn't find anywhere that this is true. Any help would be appreciated. -	2017-08-19 17:33:41Z	VaTo	0	0	blood, blood-clotting
13374	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/13374/is-there-any-known-link-between-cholecystitis-gall-bladder-inflammation-and-br	Is there any known link between cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation) and breastfeeding?	I have helped new mothers with breastfeeding for over a decade now.  I am often surprised how many end up with their gall bladder removed within the year following birth, many in the first few months.  Many will say they had some irritation during pregnancy, while many also had no indications at all.  I am well educated on the mechanics of breastfeeding and it's biological components within the mother.  It is well known that while breastfeeding, you release a linear peptide called CCk (cholecystekinin) that aids in digestion, and it floods your systems and is excreted in the milk.  Among the actions CCK is triggering, a major one is the gall bladder to release bile.   In most cases I am seeing, the woman is under 30, in otherwise relatively good health, no history of being overweight, etc.  I cannot seem to understand why so frequently I am seeing such young women with no major risk factors have this issue and am trying to understand it it's preventable.  I became interested when it happened to  .  I had a doctor willing to help me look at life changes to support my gall bladder through diet to see if it could heal.  I cannot say I will never need it out, I am at higher risk that I will, eventually.  My current enzymes have been stable and fine for years and that I kept my gall bladder and had another baby without any flares.  I had to follow a pretty strict diet for a year and then I was able to slowly add foods back in and my inflammation seemed to subside.  I went back to a stricter diet after birth, due to my prior experience, but that was merely a precaution.  I do not think that is possible in all cases, this was only after thorough exams and talks with my doctor that he felt it   be worth trying to heal it versus removal. My thought is if we could know what puts a specific mother at risk, perhaps we could preemptively help her take measures to avoid the issue.  It's considered a minor surgery generally, but no mother wants surgery when recovering from birth and trying to take care of a young baby, etc.  I would love if I could find any link there as I have poked around trying to understand a potential link for at least 8 years now since I went through it.  I have no anecdotal statistics on this, but I can tell you that in helping about 50 mothers a month, I am getting 4-5 in there asking me about the effects of this surgery on breastfeeding, every month.  That seems very high to me for healthy women in this age range.-	2017-08-19 16:54:39Z	threetimes	3	0	breastfeeding, gallbladder
13369	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/13369/is-our-use-of-cooking-oils-responsible-for-the-insufficient-conversion-of-omega	Is our use of cooking oils responsible for the insufficient conversion of Omega-3 to EPA and DHA?	It is well known that the conversion rate of Omega-3 to EPA and DHA is too low to supply us with the required amounts. But this is nevertheless a strange situation, why would natural selection have led to a vulnerability where lack of seafood means that you're going to be deficient on EPA and DHA? But if we dig deeper and consider someone who only eats natural foods, then we need to consider that such a person will not eat any refined fats and oils. Such a person would end up getting all the fats from vegetables, nuts and seeds, the fats contained in there are for a large part Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats. This doesn't seem to be relevant to the low conversion rate, however, when sticking to such a diet on the long term, a large fraction of the body fat would become the Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats that this person eats. Then given that in a natural setting, the Omega-3 in the human body is present in high concentrations in fat tissue, it seems to me that it's there that the enzymes that convert Omega-3 to EPA and DHA should be present. The low conversion rate in our bodies is then due to having filled the fat cells with saturated fats an mono-unsaturated fats with only very small amounts of poly-unsaturated fats.-	2017-08-19 00:33:55Z	Count Iblis	5	1	omega-3

I recall reading, perhaps 25 years ago, one of those counter-intuitive factoids noting that milk had more calories than soda, ounce for ounce (but of course that this was offset by nutritional benefits of milk). I believe this was referring to skim milk, widely quoted (and presumably stable over time) at 90 calories per 8 ounces, or 135 calories per 12 ounces. And I think I remember noticing that it made sense because a 12-ounce can of (regular sweetened) soda was typically labeled as less than this -- the number I picture seeing is 120 calories. But in recent times I see 12-ounce cans of soda labeled as at least 140 and sometimes 150+ calories, reversing the comparison that I thought used to be made. I am unable to find mention of lower calorie contents in the past or evidence of the factoid I recall (skim milk > soda). I know it is a bit ill-defined because of variation between brands/types of soda. So: was a typical 12-ounce regular soda (Coke, Pepsi, etc.) 140-150 calories even 25 years ago? Has it increased (which I can imagine might happen gradually over time due to a stealth "sweetness war")?

Missing a dose or stopping can lead to withdrawal symptoms like depression, anxiety, fatigue, irritability.   Therefore missing a dose may leave an individual feeling less happy, less energetic Questions:-	2017-08-12 10:08:02Z	DoctorWhom	0	0	lasting-effects-duration, energy, add-adhd, amphetamine, neuroscience

13278	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/13278/for-varicella-zosterchickenpox-when-are-vaccination-antiviral-drugs-effecti	For varicella zoster(chickenpox), when are vaccination / antiviral drugs effective?	The UK does not routinely vaccinate its citizens against chickenpox though the info website of the chief healthcare provider acknowledges that vaccinations are available and there are also circumstances where antiviral drugs may be prescribed I recently received advice from my doctor that there isn't much point in either vaccinating or prescribing drugs for chickenpox, and the consensus for adults who have never had chickenpox seems to basically be that you take your chances, suffer the infection should it be contracted and serious complications are unlikely though it's more unpleasant to contract as an adult than as a child I'm thus confused as to why the NHS website would create one impression (steps can be taken for adults with no chickenpox immunity) and the doctor another slightly different impression (steps aren't taken..). While there isn't a direct contradiction, neither source has said when steps are taken, but the doctor implied that steps aren't taken because there is no point. In what context would it make sense for an adult with no immunity to get vaccinated, or to take antiviral drugs? I presume that vaccination would only be successful up to the point that said adult is exposed - walk into a party and be greeted by a child with full on chickenpox and it's too late for vaccination.. but what about antivirals? Could that adult go home, and start a course of drugs that would effectively kill any viruses they'd contracted, before developing a full blown infection of their own? What about the situation where said adult lives with a child who wakes up one morning with a chickenpox rash? Given that the child is apparently contagious a few days before the first spot, is the adult likely too far along the infection timeline themselves for antivirals to have any effect? Is there a point of no return, beyond which AV drugs are ineffective, and for chickenpox this point is  so early that it's usually too late by the time anyone realises?-	2017-08-11 13:55:52Z	Caius Jard	2	0	disease-transmission, chickenpox

Let's assume that the infant is also breastfed exclusively - apparently, this assists the immunity because the mother's milk contains antibodies the newborn can use for resistance to various infections. It seems like there is thus a mechanism where antibodies can be acquired from the mother and used by an infant to fight a disease. I'm told that breastfed babies do not get sick as often as formula fed ones, because disease the mother is exposed to causes antibodies to pass from the mother to the baby in the breast milk. -	2017-08-11 13:33:25Z	Caius Jard	2	0	immune-system, disease-transmission, breastfeeding, chickenpox

What is the definition of the medical term of art "suicidal ideation"? For example, does any fleeting thought or consideration of suicide as a possible option count, or is more required? Does it require a firm conclusion that suicide is the only reasonable option?

I've had flat feet for years, but unfortunately, my parents didn't really know that this was an issue until it was pretty much too late to correct it.

As well, I've gotten some custom orthotics. However, the podiatrist I see insists that the orthotics are fine, and that my feet don't need to be pushed anymore into the right position than they already are.  I'm pretty sure he's wrong, but if he's not, I don't want to insist that my inserts be adjusted, only to find out that I was wrong. I only have feelings as to whether or not my feet are being held in the right position, but these are subjective, and I don't think they're reliable.

13190	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/13190/alternate-appendicitis-treatment-appendix-drain-via-colonoscopy	Alternate appendicitis treatment: Appendix drain via colonoscopy	I know that appendicitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics and that 1 reason healthcare cost is so high in the US compared to other countries is appendectomies for almost all cases of appendicitis. But the bacteria that get trapped in the appendix in someone with appendicitis are gut flora that help our immune system not overreact and make vitamins such as vitamin K. And research shows that the appendix is a safe house for gut flora when someone has a lot of vomiting and diarrhea that would wash away the gut flora. So people who have appendectomies done have to take probiotics after an illness with vomiting and diarrhea to help replenish the gut flora. Taking antibiotics kills most of the good bacteria which is good for appendicitis but not good in the long term. Some antibiotic resistant bacteria such as C. diff which is normally found in the microbiome can cause colitis after taking antibiotics and this colitis can be deadly. So I thought of an alternative to appendectomies and antibiotics for people with appendicitis. Colonoscopy, specifically drainage of the appendix. This would allow the mucus and gut flora to flow from the inflamed appendix to the colon and stop the appendicitis from getting any worse. In other words, it would prevent the appendix from rupturing. And if there are a few living cells of the appendix left after an appendectomy, it can regenerate itself. Of course this would mean a higher percentage of people having reoccurring appendicitis but it could also mean a longer appendix in people who have previously had appendicitis. And a longer appendix would be able to keep even more gut flora safe from being washed away due to vomiting and diarrhea. But is this a reasonable alternative to have people with appendicitis go for a colonoscopy to drain their appendix?-	2017-08-04 18:16:04Z	Butterfly and Bones	0	0	treatment-options, colon, appendicitis, appendix, colonoscopy

The WHO gives   in terms of percentage of energy intake. That, combined with some popular wisdom makes the think that it isn't the same if I eat, say a chocolate bar, before or after lunch. From what I understand, the major problem with free sugars is that they cause an insoline production spike that our body is not quite prepared to deal with in the long run. If I were to eat some   (such as a regular meal), the insuline levels would rise at a normal pace until the free sugar intake and would drop less after the sugar processing, because there would still be the rest of the meal to digest, effectively reducing the insuline spike. So, it is worse to consume free sugars before a meal than after? If so, how much worse is it? For the same ammount of adverse effects, can I ingest more free sugars after a regular meal than after a small one?  please consider as meals something a nutricionist would recommend to an average, healthy adult person, a "regular meal" being the lunch, and the small meal the mid-morning break.-	2017-08-04 18:17:54Z	Butterfly and Bones	2	0	digestion, diabetes, sugar, time-of-day, meal

This is a relatively unanswered question on the net, so I decided to ask it here. For a specific example: Subject A is 14 (young adolescent). He currently maintains a partial sexual relation with a girl (I couldn't find a better way to put it), meaning they touch each other, engage in oral sex, but have not attempted penetrative sex and do not plan to. Will this affect A's height or genital size in adulthood? The main piece of evidence pointing to anything remotely related to this I see on the internet, is an academic study conducted on hamsters, and it suggests that premature sex stunts growth both physically and mentally. The sources were, well, not the most credible, and only cited this single study, which I found to be of questionable reliability. Below are the articles I saw.

My wife went to an Ontario (Canada) public hospital and they performed a blood test, among other things. The test revealed a presence of bacteria in the blood. They said they will send it for analysis to determine the exact bacteria, which may take up to 48 hours.  Somebody from the hospital called a day or so later and said that there's no need to worry, the bacteria should be all gone, and it was most likely introduced into the blood stream (and the sample) during the actual blood test. They said there's no need for follow-up tests. They mentioned that the needle was sterile, but the bacteria was probably on her skin. Is this normal? I thought that with proper procedures your risk of infection should be essentially zero. How effective is the sterilizing wipe that is used before inserting the needle? I'm asking whether what happened (ie blood contaminated during a blood test) is a fairly normal occurrence or if it indicates non-trivial issues with the hospital staff's procedures that should be brought to someone's attention. In other words, something like "Yeah, this happens sometimes, it's not a big deal" vs "Uh.. you should really notify your local health authority ASAP, there's a clear health hazard for other patients".-	2017-07-28 22:48:01Z	Carey Gregory	0	0	blood-tests, bacteria

I recently saw a jaw specialist who did a series of tests to determine if there was a problem in my jaw. The clinic specializes in providing treatment to people with a TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disorder. I am particularly curious about one of the tests he performed. The test went as follows: The result was that, after holding the tongue depressors in my mouth, I was able to resist much harder than before (the doctor was unable to push my arms down). My physical capacity increased significantly.  The doctor explained to me that the tongue depressors created a gap in my mouth that allowed my TMJ to decompress. He said that, when my jaw was in its normal position, the brain was in a state of trying to protect itself and so my physical output was being limited. He mentioned the term, "fight or flight". According to him, after the tongue depressors put a gap between my teeth, the brain was no longer being signaled to protect itself and so my physical output was not being limited.  I've had cuts and scrapes before and I don't believe they have impacted my physical performance, but with the test he conducted, there was a significant difference.  How does this test actually work and why is my physical output being limited by a problem with my jaw?  Reference: 1. Management of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction. Published by Jemima Atkins.

So searching for possible ways to increase intake, I noticed a number of "meal replacements" (like Soylent, but many of them DIY), which use potassium chloride or potassium citrate to provide the necessary intake.

12791	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12791/chronic-sleep-problem-blue-light-glasses-stopped-working	Chronic sleep problem - blue-light glasses stopped working	I have had chronic sleep problems for 11 years. It started very suddenly. I ended up taking zimovane for about 3 and 1/2 years, almost every day. I had to kick that habit as after a while I needed to increase dosage for it to be effective.  Each night followed a similar pattern: I'd have no problem falling asleep but it would be a very shallow sleep and during the night I'd wake up fully. Some nights I'd fall back into a shallow sleep, others I'd be awake until morning. I basically tried everything and nothing worked.  However last October I started to wear blue-light blocking glasses 3 hours before bed and the results were miraculous: I suddenly started to sleep 7 hours straight. I could not believe it. The glasses block blue-light entering the pineal gland. Blue light hitting the pineal gland suppresses the production of melatonin.  The glasses kept working until last April I noticed I started to sleep less deeply again. Each night got a little bit worse and in the last 2 weeks I've barely had 2 or 3 hours sleep per night. I've had to quit my job as a result.  Im baffled and deeply sad that the blue-light blocking glasses are no longer proving effective. I have some theories: 1/ some studies show melatonin production naturally decreases in summer. However taking melatonin tablets does not help me at all. I also each foods rich in melatonin such as cherries and bananas, and take magnesium, vitamin B6 & B5, but to no avail. I  2/ light is a form of radiation - perhaps other forms of radiation such as electromagnetic radiation from devices are keep me awake? This would be depressing as I work in IT and I live in an apartment block where everyone has Wifi (and I'm therefor being constantly hit with Wifi signals). Im not sure if this is proven science though. These are just 2 of my theories. Is there any reason why I would suddenly begin to sleep badly again? Could it be seasonal? It's not something I can deal with - I had to quit a 2 year job I liked very much as I simply could not work effectively on 3/4 hours disrupted sleep. I'm getting very desperate. Please advise.

In fact, my eyes actually feel 'healthier' from not having dried up lenses in my eyes, which, at the end of the work day, makes my eyes itch and turn really red.  Without wearing lenses recently, I also feel more 'awake' and lively, without experiencing dry eyes by late afternoon. Is zooming in on the computer screen (when needed) a 'healthier' option to go with, instead of wearing contacts all day long? FWIW, I don't drive a car.

So, my question really is specific to doing work at a desk - on a computer, reading a book, a paper, etc.  Is it ok to go without lenses?

My question concerns the consumption of pure, unsweetened cocoa. The cocoa to be consumed could either be boiled or mixed with tap water. Its consistency could range from buttery to creamy to soda-like. I could consume the cocoa without any sweeteners or other additives, although occasionally I might add a dash of cinnamon or other spice or even a teaspoon of peanut to sweeten it up a bit. Leaving aside the dietary limits for these occasional additives, is there a practical limit to the amount of cocoa a healthy person could consume per day? I understand that eating a kilo of anything, even so-called "super foods", could make you sick, but as a practical diet plan, I'm thinking of a regimen that consists of oatmeal with cocoa for breakfast, a lunch of cocoa-coated veggie fries, chilled cocoa with peanut butter or whipped cream for my dinner dessert, and the usual sauces and dips made out of cocoa. In short, every meal will have the dark brown powder as an ingredient. This isn't an entirely hypothetical question. I've adopted a cocoa-based diet as a means of curbing my unhealthy craving for sweets, having recently learned I have symptoms of prediabetes. By accident I discovered that after eating extra dark chocolate I found my usual bland banana super sweet.

So, I'd simply say that this lower ring is caused by a cataract. To be honest, the "cataract ring" is not just lower, but also slightly right; the off-vertical angle is roughly 20 degrees.  It's interesting that my other eye also has similar downward double-vision (with a smaller 10 degree rightward shift).  (I get even more cataract glare details when I focus on the small dot to the left, instead of the ring, but I'm trying to keep this question simple.) Do most people have downward double-vision in both eyes like me?  If so, is there any theory about why/how the eye changes asymmetrically as we age?

A few weeks ago I caught my toe (big toe, right foot) beneath a door when opening it.  The toenail took on a pink/purple color for a few days, and after spending some time in the ocean it became clear that the nail had mostly detached from the nail-bed underneath.   Specifically, there's about 3mm of healthy nail-bed still attached along the left edge of the toenail, and 4mm on the right edge.  The remaining central area of the nail is detached, straight from the tip all the way to the base of the nail (can slide a probe around in this space between the nail and the nail-bed easily and with no pain).  The detached area seems relatively normal, but is picking up a slight yellow tinge.   Would it normally be recommended to cut away the detached portion of the nail (leaving the healthy strips along each side intact), or to just leave it in place while it regrows?

[on hold]	I went through ALOT of life changes (divorce, moving, death in the family, new job) in the past year that attributed to poor dieting and weight gain. I was always a pretty chubby kid, but in my early 20s, I started taking better care of myself. I'm 5'3", 29yrs old. For the past 8/9 years Ive been a consistent 125lbs. In the past year, up until April I had gained 26lbs, 151lbs. During this stressful time I also started having issues with sleep, either days without any sleep, very little sleep, the inability to go back to sleep if I wake up at night, or hours of laying in bed with my eyes closed just aggravated that I was still awake. My doctor recommended I up my melatonin to 10mg per night, so I supplement with that nightly with little help. In April I started watching my diet because I felt so "blah", from my weight gain, heels sore, back sore, tight pants, let alone what it's done to my self esteem, I'm usually a pretty confident woman. I have cut ALL refined sugars, and bread, added a cup of beans to my diet daily, switched to skim milk instead of fattened milk or cream in my coffee, subbing coconut or olive oil instead of butter or margarine when cooking, fresh or frozen instead of canned veggies and fruit, salt substitute instead of salt, switched to lean meats only (turkey, chicken, fish) and have made breakfast my highest protein meal of the day. When I snack I snack on high fiber snacks, fruit or raw veggies, pretzels(one of my only packaged foods now, ugh), or part skim string cheese, and I drink water or coffee or homemade smoothies (I'm a sweet tea girl so this has been especially difficult). My activity has little change, I've just extended my dogs' walks to twice a day... I've lost 5lbs since April 16th, when I started. I would think with all the changes especially the higher fiber, cutting sugars, and switching from sweet tea to water, that I would've lost more in this much time. I stopped gaining which is good, but stepping on the scale and seeing 146lbs, was as far as I had reached was discouraging. Are my expectations too high?

No need to comment "oh sorry we cannot give advice" made up story, purely fictional there is a guy called bob, 31 years old. Bob likes binge drinking. He drinks until he is drunk each weekend. That is, friday and saturday. During for about 12 years. he does a liver blood exam, not because he feels sick, but for some other reason. his values are high, say like this: as well an ultra sound inspection is done, no fatty liver nor cirrhosis was detected.  the doctor says: if you keep doing this, you will die before reaching 35 years. When bob did the blood exam, the woman taking the blood samples told him "i have never seen someone with values that high, soon you will probably be in the hospital" so bob stops drinking. His blood levels normalize.  For example like to this levels: After a month or two he starts drinking again, same, only weekends. But binge drinking. After a month or two of drinking he does a test again. Blood values have risen again, not as high as before, but not in the normal spectrum. for example like this  So this game goes on, bob stops drinking for 6 months straight, liver values are great, then tries drinking again, same story, blood values rise. The doctor who diagnosed death before 35, lives and is from el salvador and is a nose ear throat doctor specialist. After two years and bob having basically given up on drinking, he goes to a liver expert in colombia. That doctor is supposed to be the best liver expert in a big city and leads a team of liver transplant surgeons. He studied in spain. The doctor is presented with all results. He orders another ultra sound examination. No fatty liver, no cirrhosis. His conclusion: your levels are nothing unusual. You are not sick at all. the exams of the blood tests are handed to another doctor in the same town. This doctor says "well they are a bit high yes, but nothing to worry about" what would you think? and yes yes "drinking is bad, no need to do it".

On my last visit to the doctor, we talked briefly about how my surgery procedure will be, he told me that I have to make a decision on what kind of ligament do I want to get the ACL replacement from, the side part of my knee or the ligament under small bone of the knee, I'm sorry I just don't know the names of them.  I would like to ask what would be the best decision and why, I just don't know what would be the differences one over the other. The next question keeps me anxious. A friend that already got his ACL fixed told me that he got a shot in the back right before the surgery and that he was awake most of the time. I asked my doctor if that was going to be the case for me and he told me that he was going to put me a mask around my mouth and nose and he will put me to sleep for all the time of the surgery duration, I told this to my friend and he said I should be careful with that because if they leave the mask for more time than needed that I can get into a vegetative state which made me very nervous because I think that is worse than dying in my opinion, is this true? Also, I was wondering why some people get the anesthesia shot in their back and also make them breath something to make them go to sleep and to me he said he was going to put me to sleep with no shot, isn't the shot needed so I don't feel anything under my hips?

This has been going on for a year now. It is getting harder and harder to get them started. 4 weeks ago it took three tries. Yesterday it took only one, but I was crying out in pain (it really burned) and ended up with tears streaming down my face. The nurse wanted to remove it but I didn't want to go through that twice so I had her keep going. Once the needle was in place, my vein spasmed shut. By concentrating on breathing and relaxing I managed to get the vein to open again. The blood draw they needed to do required a syringe to actually pull the blood out. However once the IV was hooked up and the meds were flowing in, I was fine for the next hour or so, and after it was removed. Things I know already: This rather small arsenal is not enough for me. I am very motivated to get these IVs started -- it's where the miracle goes in -- but the nurses really don't like pushing sharp metal into someone who is yelling ow and ouch, who is crying real tears, etc. And it's not the best part of my day.

I have for quite some time held, what now appears to be, an unhealthy attitude that I absolutely need X hours of sleep or else my performance and mood will suffer. Now, however, I am considering that when nights like last night come, that I should just surrender to the restlessness and go about reading or working on project.

12496	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12496/why-does-sugar-get-such-a-bad-rep	Why does sugar get such a bad rep?	Most reputable health organizations (if not all) recommend keeping your daily intake of sugar to as low as possible. At the same time, these same organizations acknowledge that carbohydrates are an essential macronutrient that the body needs to properly function and that about 50% of our caloric intake should come from them. Now, aren't these two recommendations completely contradictory? All carbohydrates that the body can absorb eventually get turned into glucose, a simple sugar like any other. Why is it bad to consume a bunch of table sugar (sucrose), for example, which is already half glucose and its other fructose half will also get converted into glucose anyway, but perfectly fine to consume other more complex carbohydrates that just like sucrose, will also end up being converted into glucose? If both, simple sugars and all other carbohydrates end up as glucose in the body, then why does one get a bad rep and not the other?

12493	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12493/is-a-sinus-rinse-safe-for-adderall-insufflation	Is a sinus rinse safe for Adderall insufflation	I structured my question into five paragraphs, So you can get more or less context. The last paragraph is the only one needed to answer the question. I am 17, male. I suffer from (I have been diagnosed several times, different mental health professionals) severe Bi-Polar/ADHD. Along with this is some degree of OCD, and  moderate Anxiety. My OCD/Anxiety changes in severity, sometimes I will get panic attacks just by thinking the wrong thing (bad thoughts) which I cope with via an involuntary shaking thing I do in addition to speaking involuntarily. Comparing to my ADHD, I always am distractible. I am also diagnosed with autism.  I cannot engage in dialog (even on my gaunfacine (brand name tenex) ), as my inability to concentrate causes me to be unable to listen to other people's responses that are longer than (4/5 to 3/2) of a sentence, by then i'm distracted. Looking back, I was basically trapped in my conscious. I would mumble often, and even say random things I was thinking about. I would be so distracted in my mind, I carried out daily activities like walking around, cooking, cleaning, all sub-consciously (until external stimuli comes, then I snap out of it and somehow am somewhat but not completely aware of whats been happening). This sub-concious action has resulted in me almost destroying a blender by screwing it the wrong direction. I was prescribed Adderall IR after asking my psychiatrist for a study aid. He gave me 20mg per day, and I take it discretionarily When I first started, 10mg IR oral allowed me to somewhat concentrate on the GED material I was studying for roughly 1-1.5 hours. At least concentrate long enough to pick up the material. 20mg IR oral was a miracle. On 20mg IR oral, I picked up mathematical concepts immediately. For GED, my first time taking 20mg IR, I understood conceptual how chords work, where before, when I took geometry in summer school, I only understood how to calculate them. In addition, I could finally understand people, social/human relationships. My grandmother was surprised at my ability to engage in dialog, and my ability to talk about topics others had interest in. I was even able to train myself to subconsciously pause for a few seconds after listening to someone in order to think about what they said before responding. This allowed me to understand people's perspectives very well. When taking an exam (GED or SAT) I needed to make sure meds last the whole time. If they begin wearing off, I needed to re-dose. Adderall takes 10-20 minutes to start kicking in orally for me and stop working after about 60-80 minutes orally, so this led me to research ways of getting it to kick it faster. I first found sub-lingual, which was on a mental health forum, funny enough it was for anxiety meds, but I google sub-lingual adderall and sure enough it works, so I tried 10mg IR sublingual and it felt like slightly over 20mg IR, kicking in after about a minute. I could study phenomenally, I was picking things up better than 20mg IR and after learning something I struggled with in highschool, I was overwhelmed with joy. I felt like I could reach my full potential. Over a few days I continued researching adderall, and while researching how effects differ when taking sub-lingual vs oral, there was a couple people talking about "snorting", at first I thought these people where just feins abusing adderall, until I ran into a post where a man who was prescribed it had used nasal insufflation late in the night to get some desk work done. He said 5mg IR insufflated is very powerful, but lasted long enough to do work he had. I decided to try this method, I crushed up a 5mg, and crushed it up with a morter-pestal. I then placed it on my desk and made it a pile. I pinched about 1.5mg-2mg worth and put it on my fingertip. I then held the finger to one nostril, covered the other, and inhaled hard. It started with this addrenaline rush which lasted maybe a half minute, and for the next 5-10 minutes I had superb concentration on the english material I was studying. This method is perfect to me because if one portion of an english assignment is more challenging for me to concentrate on, I administer more, then in a few minutes I move to study a new concept. If that concept is easy for me to concentrate on, I administer less. I worry about neurotoxicity, and if I can get by on a lower dose that means less potential for brain damage. I read that nasal insufflation, done this way can be harmful to the nasal cavities. This gave me the Idea of sinus rinse bottles.  They (sinus rinse bottles) are designed to clear sinuses by pouring water in one nostril, and it flows through the sinus clearing through the other nostril. If I dissolve a dose of Adderall in a small amount of water, it goes through and absorbs through mucus. I plug my other nostril to maximize Adderall absorption. Then pour the water into a bowl. Is this method safer to direct contact?-	2017-07-19 00:02:42Z	Butterfly and Bones	0	0	prescription, inhalation, adhd, sinus

Now I'm working as a programmer, sitting too much at my desk and already notice that sometimes I have a muffin top. This another thing I want to fix, but I'm guess that it is best fixed with reducing amount of consumed sugar and carbohydrates, and not so critical, because it is not visible under my shirt. So I regard this as just a signal that something needs to change. What I'm actually want to fix is the constant fatigue I had because of working at startup, constantly overtiming, missing deadlines, dealing with changing requirements and other development stress. You probably know how it could be. I'm going to try to find more balanced job, but I guess I need to change my lifestyle too.  So, how much exercise is optimal to have the most energy? And what kind of exercise should it be? Should I run for 20 minutes every morning, or should I do it only 3-4 times a week? 3 times a week means I could save time and have less clothes to wash and shoes have time to dry, but every day will be better to build a habit. Optimizing for endorphins is another priority, because I actually want to create habit. In university it was because socializing (I rarely went to the stadium alone, now I'm exercising alone.) Should I try to find friends in some fitness club? Or would some push-ups or squats in pomodoro breaks be enought? Any other suggestions for healthy pomodoro break fillers? Or "No pain, no gain" is true, and I just need to try to push myself to the limit every day? I once went to some fitness and nutrition seminar made by trainers of some gym. They talked a lot about how to lift more weight, but when I asked what to do if I want to be better in sport like chess, they laughed at me, like chess is not sport.

I feed a feral cat and her litter of 4 5-week old kittens in my backyard. I got a small scratch on my hand which bled for a few minutes and heard it hiss. That's when the mom came and proceeded to lick it. After freaking out for a bit, I decided to go the ER and was given the first dosage of post exposure shots (2 on each arm, and 1 at the site of the scratch).   I didn't go to the ER three days later as I was supposed to. I don't have a way to quarantine all the cats but they do house themselves in a shed. Every so often, I check on them and I don't see any neurological differences, salivation, or any other telltale symptoms like disorientation or aggression. On any of the cats, I don't see any injuries. I'll still continue to observe each of them, especially the one that scratched me which allows me to pet it, as I still have a 1% doubt since it hasn't been 10-14 days since I started observation.  I would continue the vaccinations but money is a concern as well. Also, I looked up a report of rabies cases in my county (Hudson of NJ), and I was very surprised to see that there have only been 5 cases of rabid cats from 1989 to 2016 and only 18 raccoons in the same time frame. It's the only county in NJ to have a total of double digit cases among all reported animals while the other counties were in the several hundreds.  What is the risk vs benefit of getting the next rabies shot?-	2017-07-19 00:07:18Z	Butterfly and Bones	2	0	vaccination, rabies, cat-scratch-fever

I'm planning on starting a family soon. One of my parents and their brother (my uncle) have a mental illness. My uncle has been diagnosed with schizophrenia since he was about 19. My parent has a personality disorder. As such, I was wanting to have some genetic testing done in order to determine the likelihood of my future children having mental illness. I spoke with a doctor and he seemed to think that a genetic test was a good idea but in my country/area the process takes over 2 years (the cost of free health care, I suppose).  23andme seems like an interesting product and Id be willing to pay a private company for quicker results. Ive read over some of their documentation, but cannot determine if their tests look for the types of illnesses that I would like to know about and the likelihood of my children developing them.

I bought some colorplace spray cans from Walmart for like a dollar each. Turns out it is terrible paint (surprise). But I did something I very much regret, the room is small and I spray painted the entire metal baseboard heater with the colorplace. I noticed very quickly that this paint releases an extremely strong paint scent into the air. So strong it permeated into the other rooms to the point that I have to sleep downstairs. This may be because I had to use at least 5 coats on the baseboard, which is about 9 feet long. I don't have a painting mask so I strapped sweatpants around my mouth/nose. This room has two windows very near where I was painting and I had them open all the way with a fan going. Still, while painting this stuff smells incredibly strong. Now I've done some research and I've been lead to believe that paint can release VOC's into the air   after painting. My bed will be right next to this baseboard. So just for peace of mind alone I wish I had not painted it. If I wait it out will it ever be ok to sleep next to this baseboard? Or should I remove it all now. Keep in mind it is painted on metal, and at least 5 coats were put on.-	2017-07-19 01:28:09Z	Butterfly and Bones	0	0	toxicity, poison, flora, poison-ivy-oak, toxic-fumes

My biochemistry knowledge is basic so I apologize if I use concepts incorrectly! Specifically, I want to know about the likelihood of having an allergic reaction to something, given an allergy to something else...  I'll clarify the situation with the following example:  Say a person develops an allergy to some molecule, A. Another molecule, B, has a different skeletal structure. A and B are both thought to have a similar mechanisms for the treatment of some medical problem. If a person is allergic to A, are they more likely to be allergic to B? To make this even more concrete, let's say a person is allergic to varenicline, a synthetic molecule used to treat nicotine addiction. Is that person more likely to be allergic to Lobeline (indian tobacco)? They have different skeletal formulas, but varenicline is an agonist on nicotine acetlycholine receptors, while lobeline is a mixed agonist-antagonist on these receptors. (Maybe this is not relevant?).  Does the fact that both molecules have similar neurochemical mechanisms of action on dopamine receptors, have any implications as to whether the immune system would identify the new molecule as an allergen? What about an allergen, physical or chemical, is it that the immune system is actually ID'ing or remembering? Disclaimer: I have an allergy to varenicline, and considered taking lobeline until i read they have similar neurochemical mechanisms. I'm not looking for advice, because I am not going to take lobeline. I'm just curious.

12419	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12419/is-added-sugar-itself-an-issue-or-what-goes-along-with-it	Is added sugar itself an issue, or what goes along with it?	I'm not really fond of that title, but there is only so much space. Pretty much, from reading online, which seems to be among the least reliable sources for dietary information, the issue with added sugar is a combination of lower nutrient to calorie ratio, "damage" to gut bacteria, and increasing glycemic index. That is to say that everyday you need a certain amount of nutrients and calories. You don't want to exceed the calorie limit, and you don't want a nutrient deficient so a low nutrient:calorie food can cause issues. Then, foods with a high glycemic index cause spikes in blood sugar which cause all sorts of damage even before you take into consideration the insulin spike that follows. As for the effect on gut bacteria, the more pathogenic strains tend to also be the ones that like sugar and fat. Or so I've been led to believe. I have the least information on this. From my understanding, these are the reasons added sugar is a problem. It seems to me that if I can mitigate these three issues, then adding a bit of sugar (not talking about cups of the stuff) to my baking shouldn't be an issue. For context, I'm not talking about buying pre-made foods, or processed foods. I do not eat those. Rather I am thinking exclusively about my baking. In particular, or as an example if you will, my "bran" muffins. They aren't really bran muffins since the original bran recipe i developed was cost prohibitive (gluten-free oat bran costs a fortune! Gluten-free is a must due to Celiacs.), but rather flax meal and chia seed muffins that use whole oat flour, quinoa flour, almond flour, and cinnamon. Yes, cinnamon is a major ingredient...as in 1/3 of a cup (probably a dangerous amount). I'm looking to address the issue of added sugar before going forward with an expensive sequence of experimentation to develop a new muffin recipe as well as well as keep in consideration for future recipes that I may make.-	2017-05-25 18:52:01Z	Nero gris	0	1	diet, sugar, healthy-cooking

I'm told it's related to a rare muscular disorder that I suffer from... I believe the name is  . What's really strange though, is that this condition generally only affects me in cold weather... eyes freezing shut, face looking like I've had a stroke, hands useless for writing or typing purposes (or really purpose at all, in fact). The cold-weather stuff is manageable. It's something that I can physically avoid, by staying inside during the cold months. Or by wearing super warm gloves, face and eye warmers, etc. But the issue I'm posting about here is unrelated to that. Or seemingly unrelated. From time to time, for no apparent reason, I find myself with one of these total-body cramps. A light cramp... sort of a cross between total weakness/paralysis and a slight crawling feeling throughout my body. Much stronger mostly in my frontal neck, facial area, abdomen, and quadriceps. But felt elsewhere as well. It's a lot more terrible than it may sound, and generally lasts for 1-2hrs at a time and appears out of nowhere. My research has shown that the symptoms are very similar to a low blood sugar or diabetic episode. Last time this happened (about two weeks ago), I actually got one of those blood sugar testers and happened to have not eaten yet that day, so the test was legit and showed it was exactly where it was supposed to be. And this was in the middle of one of these weird muscular episodes, so blood sugar is removed as a culprit. Is this something that anyone else out there is experiencing? Have you treated someone with similar symptoms? I know it's a rare disorder so not expecting much, I suppose.

There are several nutrients which I'm not getting enough of from food, in some cases hardly any, due to dietary restrictions. I   get the nutrients I need if I carefully structure my diet, but I don't want to. I'm really lazy. I'm still trying to eat a varied diet including plenty of fruits and veggies, I just know it's not enough. So I'm taking a multivitamin and a couple of other pills. Pretty much all the information I can find suggests this is a bad idea, but none of it seems to directly answer why. The biggest apparent reason is that supplements are not absorbed as well as food. But I can't see any indication of how well supplements are absorbed. I know it depends on a lot of factors (including the dosage) and is probably hard to measure, but don't we have at least a rough idea in specific situations? If I take, say, 100% of the RDA of iron in a pill, is the amount my body absorbs probably more or less than 50%? How much do caffeine, vitamin C, calcium, etc. affect the absorption? The information always seems to be qualitative, not quantitative. Furthermore, if a certain dosage won't be sufficiently absorbed to fulfill my requirements, why can't I just take more? I know that this leads to diminishing returns and high dosages can be problematic, but that doesn't quite explain it. The amounts found in supplements are generally on the order of 100% of the RDA,   less than the amounts which are considered risky which are more like 1000% (with the exception of calcium, where there are some concerns about supplementing around 100-200%). It's hard to believe that the cost of manufacturing the pills or the difficulty of swallowing them would significantly increase in many cases, especially when we're talking about adding a few milligrams or less. Other than that, many of the fears seem irrelevant. Don't take certain dangerous supplements like the dirty dozen. Don't make certain combinations. Don't try to use supplements to treat diseases like cancer. And so on. Is the problem uncertainty? Does it just seem safer to tell people to get their vitamins from food? Or perhaps do some people know what can and should be done but others are still catching up? OK, that's a lot of rambling, let me try and make a coherent, SE style question: Suppose I'm a healthy adult between the ages of 20 and 40. I don't know of any medical conditions that I have relevant to supplements. I am not currently deficient in anything. I can afford to buy as many supplements as I need, I remember to take them, and I don't mind doing so. EDIT: it looks like I need to clarify. I'm vegan. There are several nutrients that I can't easily get from food, particularly B12, calcium, and vitamin D. My diet is generally fairly good - plenty of fruits, veggies, nuts, and grains - but that doesn't help enough with those nutrients. Yes some vegetables have calcium but I don't want to eat, say, 600g of kale every day. It seems safe to say that I need calcium in my body, so I want to know if pills work for that. I'm not suggesting living on junk food and pills.-	2017-05-23 21:06:19Z	Alex Hall	3	0	nutrition, micronutrients, food-supplements, supplement, deficiency

12384	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12384/why-is-acid-reflux-allegedly-often-confused-with-chest-pain	Why is acid reflux (allegedly) often confused with chest pain?	I get irregular, sharp, short bursts of pain in my chest, on the left side, near my heart. Supposedly, heart and circulatory related pain is neither sharp nor short, so this pain may be muscle or lung-lining related. (I also haven't had any shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue).  I've had plenty of acid reflux over the years (stomach acid gets into my throat and burns like crazy until addressed), and I just don't understand why, whenever I try to look for information about my mystery chest pain, I'm forced to hear about something as seemingly irrelevant as acid reflux. It's like calling tech support and they ask you if your computer's plugged in. Am I missing something here? Can acid reflux cause actual chest pain, and not just esophageal pain? If it can, then how? I'm under the impression that the digestive system is a closed system, and that a stomachache shouldn't cause, say, shoulder pain or a backache. (edit: I found somewhat similar question, and it's answers mention esophageal spasms, but are such symptoms common enough to be relevant, and would they actually cause chest pain? would it not be obvious that the source of the pain is the esophagus?)-	2017-05-22 16:49:12Z	Sebastian Hahn	3	0	pain, gerd-acid-reflux, chest

Certain medical accessories for drug administration, such as syringes   for babies, applicators for vaginal ovules, inhalers and so on, come in direct contact with mucous membranes (e.g. mouth, vagina).  These accessories are usually made from plastic and are (most probably) sterilized before being packed, so getting an infection from using them is unlikely. However, they are produced from different raw materials (again, mostly plastic) and I do not know whether these industrial processes leave some kind of residue on the accessory, and whether this residue can be harmful to the body when inserted directly into the body. Consumer leaflets do not address the issue of first use and whether these instruments should be cleaned before used for the first time.

Those pains were a screaming nightmare (I cringe to write about it now). Last time it happened was in early 20s. Went for physical therapy. Luckily it has not happened since (I'm lady in late 30s) However, I have been trying to train for Spartan Races, thereby doing heavier exercises without strengthening knee - which causes periodic water in knee. And I have those horrible flashbacks for when I would dislocate my knee. I really wish to compete in Spartan Races (perhaps Marathons). Sure, I can do 90 minutes of cardio, weights, yoga a day, but I really wish to train without being fearful of dislocation. At this point, I am open to surgery. I am also researching exercises best for Patellar Sublaxation.  What type of surgery should I look for. Should surgery be done on both knees at once, or one at a time. Please point me in the right direction. One more thing. Ever since early 20s when I bend both knees, it makes crunching sound.

I've been seen seeing the   recently from Cigna.  And it got me wondering.  Strictly from a financial sense, what is the estimated average benefit (or cost) of annual checkups.  Seeing these commercials run so heavily would make me think that they see this as beneficial to them financially. Even if it is being done more to enhance their image than to directly make money, it would seem they've decided that the cost of annual checkups must be fairly reasonable for them. So what is the estimated financial benefit of an average checkup? Though I really have to imagine there has to be a wealth of data on this question out there SOMEWHERE, let's definitely try to simplify things in hopes of getting some kind of an answer by making the consideration of costs just strictly the net return for a patient paying all costs at approximate market value.  Obviously it probably changes by age, and seeing such fluctuations how would be absolutely brilliant, but an average value would be just fine.  And there's quite a lot of estimation and fluidity in such values, as costs and values change... so even old data would work great for me.  Just to get a rough idea with some support.

During the cold weather, I'd sometimes get tears in my eyes. I was starting to get a red rash around one eye and the skin would be dry, so I would apply moisturiser, but it didn't really seem to improve, so I also started using petroleum jelly (advertised as being useful for dry lips). I returned to Australia for a few weeks and it cleared up. In February, I moved to New York and was fine for at least a month, but the cold weather again brought on the tears and the dry, red skin worse than before, around both eyes. I would sometimes dry my eyes on the inner joint of my elbows and I now have rashes there too. The weather in New York is now fine; sometimes even too hot. It's been a month or two since my eyes have watered in the cold, but I still have the red, dry skin around my eyes. I thought it might be a fungal infection, so I applied some anti-fungal medicine rather than moisturiser one night, just around the eyes, being very careful to avoid the eyelids. Awakening the next morning, my skin was totally dried out I had large, cracked segments of skin. This quickly flaked off and I'm back to dry, rough red skin around my eyes, on the scale of racoon's eyes. I've been applying the anti-fungal cream to my elbow joints for a week or two now with no effect except perhaps for a reduced itchiness after application. Can anyone please advise what's going on? My pharmacist advised just to keep my skin moisturised around the eyes and said that the petroleum jelly would indeed be a reasonable approach. I had a blood test in Seattle and had no sexual diseases then btw. In the past 2 or 3 weeks, I've also developed rashes on my neck that look like ringworm  this was the main reason for the anti-fungal medicine.

12370	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12370/why-do-i-cry-when-i-vomit	Why do I cry when I vomit? [on hold]	I have noticed that my body has a specific response when I vomit and that what part of the response is going on depends on the timing. Here is that response from feeling nauseous to after vomiting: I start groaning because I am nauseous. Around that same time I start burping excessively as my stomach is upset. This causes me to get reflux into the esophagus and eventually into the mouth. But reflux does not equal vomiting. There are still more things that happen. When the reflux starts getting really bad, I get up and go to the bathroom and depending on severity, I might be covering my mouth or just walking slowly. If I am covering my mouth, I vomit and that is that, no further response. If I am just walking slowly though, there is still more to happen. After I slowly walk to the bathroom, I put my index finger into the back of my mouth to trigger vomiting. I start gagging because that is a reflex and initially my salivary glands are inhibited but afterwards they are stimulated more than usual so I secrete more saliva. This is also around the time that my eyes start watering. This could be going on for minutes with nothing besides reflux. I start actively contracting my abdominal muscles in waves to help the stomach push gastric juices up and out. Finally gastric juices come out and depending on if and when I drank water, it could all end up in the toilet or be more explosive(dilute gastric juices tends to equal more explosive vomiting). Sometimes it is just gastric juices that come out and sometimes partially digested food comes out too. If I have been vomiting a lot because of a stomach virus, green bile comes out along with the yellow gastric juices and the partly digested food, especially in the evening.  During all this time, my eyes water a lot. But why do my eyes water when I vomit? Does it have to do with the vagus nerve stimulation that causes the vomiting? -	2017-05-20 19:26:50Z	Caters	0	0	stomach, vomit, tear-duct

I've been researching cholesterol a bit (my grandma is telling me off) and I've found some sites saying that eating cholesterol is not bad since you're body makes 75% of the cholesterol found in your body. That only 20-25% of the cholesterol in your body comes from food and that if you eat more, your body will cut down on its production of cholesterol. However given that, would it be safe to say that that is only true if you don't eat more than 4 or 5 times the 'normal' amount of cholesterol? Since all the cholesterol is being provided for by food and your body is already not making any. or if you eat over 100% does your body remove the additional cholesterol?

My question is: her hand does not hurt in "idle state", only during the physiotherapy.

I was just reading up on some ALS literature, and noted something on a newly diagnosed patient. The (current) assessment is that this particular patient's ALS symptoms are caused by a glutamate deficiency. What is interesting is that the patient is a Type 2 diabetic, which would hint at that as an original source for the deficiency, as glutamate is typically synthesized in cells from glucose. But glutamate can also be synthesized, in cells, from aspartate, as in aspartame. The patient claims to have stopped drinking sugar-free beverages about a year ago, for personal reasons, which roughly lines up with the onset of the symptoms. Could it be that the patient has been unknowingly substituting glucose-to-glutamate synthesis with aspartate-to-glutamate synthesis and the change in diet stopped that? And is it maybe possible to add aspartame products to the diet and get that work-around running again, to reduce glutamate deficiency symptoms?

I don't know if it's the right way to describe it, but it felt "grainy" and like things were all over the place. It felt like there were a bunch of crisp little objects on the wall of her vagina. I also noticed that either she was so tight that I couldn't go much deeper, or that the "tunnel" was going in another weird direction, like if it took a steep turn upwards. We both like each other and I plan on seeing this girl again, but for some reason this is starting to freak me out.

There's some backstory to it, but i'll keep it as short as possible Three weeks ago i started running every evening to get some exercise. I'm starting of really slow to get used to running. In my day to day shoes i have tailored support insoles (hope this is clear, i am not sure if this is the proper translation) because i have flat feet. I've been walking on these kinds of insoles for a couple of years. The problems started when i got blisters on my foot on the places where the insoles where correcting my flat feet. I also thought is was a good idea to buy an extra pair of shoes for running so i bought a new pair of running shoes without the insoles, so i wouldn't get blisters. This worked for a couple of days but yesterday i started having some minor pain in my right foot and knee while running and when i woke op this morning and stepped out of my bed i just fell over immediately as i collapsed through my foot. Every step hurts and if i make one wrong step i almost fall over. Of course i am not running this evening, but what are the next steps? should i see a doctor or should i just wait to see what happens? and more importantly, what should i do with running? should i keep doing what i am doing or should i buy new insoles (which are really expensive) in my running shoes and just accept the blisters? or should i stop completely with running and find other exercise?

I have a wife and before we got married she was diagnosed with PCOS, but then she got pregnant and gave birth to our beautiful daughter. As what I read PCOS means you have hormonal problem. During the first month she is having trouble sleeping. She can only sleep around 2-4 hours a day. Even at night even if I place the baby away so she can just sleep for 8 hours, she can't even sleep and just stay awake till dawn. BTW she is doing breastfeeding that time. I also read about Post Partum Insomnia which is normal for new moms. I read all over the internet about the horror of having Insomnia and I feel bad that I can't do anything for her.  According to what I also read breastfeeding can cause Estrogen hormones decrease thus it will result to Insomnia. Yes, we tried to seek help from health professionals but they just gave us Iterax to help my wife fall asleep, but it just produce the same result where my wife can sleep 4 hours only. We already tried herbal medicines too but it doesn't work.  The only solution that we made is that we weaned our little girl after 1 month and 3 weeks, and she can sleep now better. Though I don't agree weaning our child in the first place, because I know how precious breastmilk is for babies, but I can't even let my wife fall apart. So the question: Is the insomnia experienced by my wife is due to its PCOS or having low hormones in the first place? P.S.

I use noise isolating in ear headphones while working. I am considering instituting "music breaks" to reduce risks related to hearing loss. A 10-20 minute review of websites haven't really given me anything better than "breaks". Before diving into papers I thought I'd ask here. What sort of regime is optimal? Is there something that gives me a good 80/20 payoff? Example regimens: Separately, is there a meaningful difference between music / talking / white noise in terms of risk of hearing loss? How much better is complete silence than mere quiet? The lack of clearer advice from healthcare source makes me suspect that no one really knows.

People with Type II Diabetes requiring long-acting insulin can inject themselves once a day with a syringe or insulin pen, but there is an alternative to that: insulin pumps.  Insulin pumps provide a continuous supply of rapid-acting insulin throughout the day, which has the same effect on the body as one daily injection of long-acting insulin.  (And if you require mealtime insulin, you can get the insulin pump to deliver a "bolus" or extra amount of insulin.) Now insulin pumps come in two types: tube pumps and patch pumps.  Tube pumps require you to inject a new injection set into your skin every 2-3 days.  Concerning patch pumps, there are two patch pumps on the market, V-Go which is injected once every 24 hours, and Omnipod which is injected once every 3 days.  There are also insulin ports like the I-Port, which is also injected once every three days. But my question is, are there any insulin pumps (or ports) which you can keep attached to your skin for more than a few days?  I just want to minimize the frequency of injections as much as possible.  Something that you just inject once and then it stays attached for two weeks or a month would be great.-	2017-05-10 13:35:32Z	Keshav Srinivasan	1	0	diabetes, medical-device, home-medical-equipment, type-2-diabetes, insulin

I've heard a thousand times that legumes themselves are "incomplete proteins", meaning they are deficient in some amino acid, so it is beneficial to combine them with grains, which have the amino acid that legumes lack. In all the websites I've read, the lacking amino acid in legumes is methionine, which grains have supposedly a lot. However, when trying to estimate how much of this amino acid I need to consume daily, I found something really confusing, legumes actually have more of all amino acids than grains (yes, including methionine). Yet, everybody is claiming that they need to be combined, and this isn't like a debate, everybody seems to agree. So why is it that mixing these two foods make "complete proteins"?

I spend most of my time in nice air conditioning, but there are a few times when I anticipate allot of excercise where I'm at risk of dehydrating to the point that I will develop a headache.  Usually when playing with toddlers outside that make me do all the heavy lifting ;)  I'm learning to be more cautious of this, but it still seems like it happens a bit too often. My first question is what to do once I already have a headache from dehydration.  I've tried simply chugging allot of water, but this just seems to lead to excessive restroom breaks, and it still takes half a day for the headache to go away.  The water seems to go through me without being absorbed or doing anything to stop a headache once it's started.  Is there a way both to speed up the process so the headache goes away faster and to avoid excessive restroom breaks in the process?  Is there only so much water I can drink at once and beyond that it's not going to help hydrate faster? Second is how do I avoid getting dehydrated so fast?  I feel like even when i go into a situation worried about getting dehydrated and drinking many bottles of water I still end up with a headache.  I may not be drinking enough because I'm worried about just needing lots of restroom breaks, but is there something else I should be doing when I'm expecting to sweat allot that will help avoid getting a headache?

This pain clearly emanates from my stomach and radiates towards my shoulders. Another symptom during this is general fatigue. The strange part is that this resolves within 10 to 15 minutes usually after which no adverse effects remain other then the usual intoxication to be expected in proportion to the alcohol intake. The pain usually starts almost immediately after consuming a drink (with a lagging period of about two minutes top) and reaches its apex around 5 minutes after ingestion. Then it remains consistent for roughly 10 minutes after which it subsides within minutes. The pain is serious enough that I have to go lie down (7/10 easily, would be higher if it would persist over longer periods). I have had this with a wide variety of beverages; Beer, wine, liquors and mix drinks all alike. When it happens seems to be completely random, doesn't matter whether I've eaten or not.

In reading about the horrific Battle of Passchendaele during World War One, I came across an anecdotal account of a British officer sheltering in a shell hole in a rain storm. The narrator claims that this officer had no wounds, and had fallen asleep on the wall of the crater while the muddy water it contained was only a foot deep.  The next morning, when the narrator awoke, the officer was still not physically wounded, but the muddy liquid had risen considerably overnight, covering the officer's face and drowning him in his sleep. I have a hard time believing that an uninjured, healthy person with no neurological or physiological problems would be able to sleep through something like this.  I'm sure many of you have experienced the acute physical discomfort and emotionally jarring panic of unintentionally inhaling water - failing to notice the sensations would be virtually  impossible.  If healthy people could sleep through drowning, the form of torture known as "waterboarding" would presumably be unremarkable rather than horrific.

This is a bit of an odd question, but here goes. Your body needs energy to function. Each organ (brain, heart, etc.) need different amounts of energy to function properly. So it stands to reason that your heart's minimum required energy is higher than that of your spleen (just an example). So here's my question: "Which organ requires the most minimum energy, and how much energy is the minimum?" I'm asking this question because I'm trying to figure out "if energy were removed from a body, such that all parts of the body had the exact same amount of energy, what would be the minimum energy needed to make sure no organs failed" (this has to do with World Building, to an extent). Furthermore, it'd be very helpful to know how much energy would be required for said organ not only for survival, but also to maintain a relatively normal, or even active, functionality. Would this equal the energy normally found in a person, or could it be lower? If I need to clarify further, just let me know.

I drink about 2 liters a day to fix my sugar craving from the real coke. I know I should be drinking more water and the next step is to quit coke zero and go onto water.

12073	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/12073/is-it-possible-for-the-lungs-and-heart-to-work-independently-of-one-another	Is it possible for the lungs and heart to work independently of one another?	I understand that the lungs take in oxygen, pass it to the heart to send throughout the body, and receive CO2 from cellular respiration that the lungs then breathe out. (Oversimplified, I know, but let's run with it for a minute, if we can.) Is it possible for the lungs to function without the heart functioning? That is, can the lungs take in oxygen, and, not having anywhere to put it, breathe it back out? Of course, breathing out wouldn't contain any excess CO2 because the heart doesn't collect it from the body.  In the event that the answer is yes, would CPR be performed differently, i.e. without the breaths between the 30 pushes? What about the converse case: can the heart function without the lungs functioning? I suppose anaerobic respiration is one form of this, but can that be sustained long-term? Once again, if the answer is yes, would CPR be performed differently?-	2017-04-26 03:25:22Z	DonielF	1	0	breathing, lungs, heart, cpr, heartbeat

I was treated with an IM nail for the tibia. The injury was caused by slipping on a hill with my foot stuck in the mud; I guess the angle and twisting motion was just right to cause the break. There was an associated fibula break at the same level as the tibia fracture and a second below my knee. The actual ankle joint was not involved at all.  I went for my 8 week xrays, and am slightly concerned at the progress, and was not really satisfied with the answers my OS provided, he seemed in a bit of a rush. On the xrays, the top fibula break showed good callus formation, but the bottom break and the tibia fracture showed no new bone growth. I was cleared to weight-bear as tolerated at week six, and have been doing so in a cam boot while using a walker. My OS did not seem too concerned about this, and did not reduce my weight bearing status. When asked the reason for the lack of bone growth he informed me that the tibia is one of the slowest healing bones in the body, and because of the break's extreme distal location, there is not much muscle and therefore not much blood supply. He said not to worry too much as it's not unusual to have no radiographic signs of bone growth at 8 weeks, sometimes it takes 10 or 12 to show. In addition, he pointed out that the lower fibula fracture showed no callus either, and since the top break was healing well that it was likely just the break's location slowing the healing progress. It is worth noting that the fracture alignment has remained good on all xrays since post op, and I do know that accepted wisdom is that the farther down the tibia you go, the longer it is likely to take to heal.  It just seems odd, as there is no pain on weight bearing, or palpation of the fracture site, and only mild soreness after stressing the leg. Movement is easy, and the leg has achieved a level of somewhat normal comfort, so it seems counter to the radiographic findings.   If it was not healing would there be pain and discomfort? I'd imagine there would be, and I experience none.-	2017-04-25 17:42:25Z	Pills N Pillows	1	0	broken-bones, bone-fractures, tibia, fibula, calluses

11985	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/11985/what-causes-asymptomatic-itching-with-rarely-distributed-rash	What causes asymptomatic itching with rarely distributed rash?	 I am not a student of medicine or a medical professional by any means. All uses of anatomic and biologic terms come from a general education plus a little hobby-knowledge. Misuses of such terms should also be excused based on the same explanation. I am interested in getting educated a little on how and what might cause an allergic-like reaction on skin in areas of high probability of rash appearance. For the past month, I've been struggling with sensations of severe itching in various areas of my body: arms, legs, torso, etc. There are some spots of rash that come and go, don't stay for too long in one spot. The spots with rash do   itch what-so-ever, only areas where signs of rash have never been observed and areas that look absolutely healthy, clean, and not dry. : There are no other accompanying symptoms. Lymph glands are normal size, not painful or swollen. No fever, no headaches or muscle aches.  :  It started off as a little itchy spot on the inner thigh, no visible rash, irritation or anything else out of place. Then itching started spreading across both thighs, lower belly, crotch area. Tiny pink macules started appearing over that area. The itching became severe and would wake me up at night. Then the signs of rash started disappearing from that area as the itching started to spread onto lower legs, higher torso, arms, and so on. The rash again appeared on the right buttock and stayed contained there. It started to look more well-defined and something I've described above, and pictures of which are below. The same rash also appeared on the outer skin of hands. Again, no itching there, only areas without visible rash. It stopped spreading from there. The papules started to dry out, and stayed pale pink. Taking of   is the only thing that keeps me from going insane even now.   HCL 25mg at night and   HCL 180 mg twice a day. The first night after taking Hydroxyzine (50 mg first time), multiple interesting spots appeared on the back, about 6 or 7. The spots were very close to each other forming thin and long shapes, almost like knife cuts. They were not the same form of rash, they weren't elevated. Again, no itching there at all. Then same prolonged 'colonies' started appearing on other parts like lower belly, higher thigh. After injecting Kenalog 40 mg/mL, which did not appear to help at all neither with itching nor with the rash, more appeared on the inner feet. :       Unfortunately, due to low reputation I cannot post more pictures. Neither me nor my doctor have any clue what's going on, and what's causing this as there are absolutely no other symptoms. I'm not allergic to any drugs, or anything at all (known). Haven't changed anything in the diet, clothes or detergent.

Before reading the news today, I only knew that elephantitiasis was a a congential birth defect caused by proteus-syndrome (because of the "Elephant Man"), but quickly learned that that was the much rarer cause for elephantitasis, and that the leading cause of Elephantitiasis is actually by parasites. This made sense to me too. But I wouldn't have ever guessed that elephantitiasis can be caused by volcanic minerals in the soil as this article details:  .

Fluoride is a common active ingredient in tooth paste to prevent dental caries. It is also added or removed from the water supply in some communities for the same reason, but only for children. My understanding is that the fluoride in tooth paste reacts with minerals in saliva then bonds to the tooth enamel. The fluoride in water is ingested and is somehow added to the developing bones and teeth of growing children, to the benefit of making decay resistant teeth. What is the biochemical pathway of each process? Where does the fluoride go and what does it interact with?

But after you finish the period of putting a bandage on your penis, will having your penis outside to expose it to the air make it faster to have your penis less sensitive to an stimulation, than keeping wearing an underware?

The pain is most severe when my wrist is in this position, with the painful area circled in red: ... so it is bent back and something is having to support it from moving any further.  For example, leaning against a wall with that hand is quite painful.  The pain is along the top of the wrist, somewhat on the ulnar side although radiating out to the whole wrist to some extent.

About a month ago I've removed a mole (nevus) which accrued on "clean" skin (de novo) about 4-5 months ago. It has always been charcoal black and 1,5 mm in diameter. So the dermatologist did a punch biopsy on it. Results are the following: *Multiple sections have been examined from specimen submitted. There is a small central area of melanocytic proliferation seen within biopsy which is subtended by chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate in the upper dermis with incontinent melanin pigment. Trans epidermal elimination of melanin pigment is seen with some melanin present in cornified layers of epidermis. There is an atypical melanocytic proliferation noted with some extension into the overlying spinous layers of epidermis. Now, I went to the surgeon and he said it is a melanoma and did the excision with 2cm margins on each side. What confuses me is the pathologist said it's not malignant while sergion says it is.  What it really is? Is it possible not to have a concrete answer looking at the above histology report? And if not what could possibly clarify it? Any help is highly appreciated.  UPDATE I have contacted the pathologist on the phone asking for clarification, and than he mentioned that he does not think it's malignant, but cannot state that on the report as he is not 100% sure.

I am afraid that I might not have had enough sleep each night (although I do not feel that much tired during the day) and that it might be harmful to me (in the long term) to sleep only around 6 hours a day. (Not sure if this is a relevant information: my age is 26.) So is it really harmful for health (in any way) to sleep just around 6 hours (or less) a day? Is there any indication to tell if an individual gets enough sleep each day?-	2017-03-30 08:17:35Z	Petch Puttichai	3	0	sleep, sleep-deprivation

11729	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/11729/anorgasmia-with-ssri-and-snri-prescriptions	Anorgasmia with SSRI and SNRI prescriptions	I am adding to the beginning of this question the caveat that I am npt asking this for me or anyone in particular.  I am studying counselling and have come across this issue whilst researching and it lead me to try and work out what options are available when helping those who come to me with sexual dysfunctions. Whilst Higgins, et al. (2010) highlights the problem with sexual dysfunctions whilst prescribed Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), I am going to split my question in parts for easier answering. This question will be concerning  .  Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants and can have significant impact on the persons quality of life, relationships, mental health, and recovery. Higgins et al points out that but what about anorgasmia? The side effects don't seem to be rare from my research online and many patients are not even told to look for it. If a man has premature ejaculations, the side effect of anorgasmia usually helps that nicely, but if it already takes long enough, it might take even longer. Higgins et al. also points out that with adjunct treatment (introducing another drug to counteract side-effects), clients treated with bupropion SR showed a significantly greater improvement in desire and frequency of engaging in sexual activity; and in a systematic review of medication switching strategies for managing sexual dysfunction, switching from SSRI to non-SSRI antidepressants may produce varying individual responses, and although the sexual dysfunction may recede, the depressive illness may reassert itself. So has there been any studies which anyone knows of which definitively help with the problem of anorgasmia whilst taking SSRI or SNRI medication? Higgins, A., Nash, M., and Lynch, A. M. (2010).

The first complication is that a UPF/SPF rating represents the denominator of the fraction of UV radiation that passes through the protective barrier.  This means that there are diminishing returns on higher UPF/SPF ratings.  For example, a mere UPF 5 blocks 80% of UV radiation.  Doubling the UPF rating blocks half of the   radiation, which is only 10% of the original amount.  Doubling it again only blocks another 5%.  Et cetera. The second complication is that the health effect of UV radiation may be non-linear.  In other words, an 80% reduction in exposure may result in more or less than an 80% reduction in risk. Ideally, I'm looking for an answer that takes these factors into account, expressing health risk as a function of UPF/SPF while holding exposure time constant.-	2017-03-28 20:20:19Z	Pills N Pillows	1	0	risks, sun-exposure, uv-rays, spf-sun-protection-factor, sunscreen-sunblock

I have really intense food allergies to a LOT of common foods. I get headaches, rashes on my arms, cystic acne on my face... I am also very skinny and have a lot of trouble gaining weight (5'7 about 140 lbs). The foods that are the worst offenders are high FODMAP foods. Beans, asparagus, onions, garlic, apples, peas. pers, peaches, almonds, milk, wheat, cabbage, broccoli, chocolate, anything with soy, potatoes, corn, and anything with processed sugars gives me problems. It's interesting that these "fermentable sugars" affect me the most, possibly because there are pathogenic yeasts in my gut feeding on these sugars? I have been able to survive on my "core 4" raw plants- lettuce, zucchini, cucumber, and honeydew melon. I also seem to be able to eat cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, and blueberries (as long as everything is organic). I'm able to eat organic ground pork and grass-fed ground beef, but fowl like chicken / turkey is no good and neither are processed meats like bacon or deli meats. Sometimes I can get away with quinoa, but in general grains are no good for me. I have also gotten my gut analyzed from Ubiome, but I'm not really sure how to read the results: This part is what makes me worried: I have almost double the amount of "Bacteroidetes" and a normal, healthy gut. Interesting, I googled   and it seems that they are gut bacteria that break down yeast (or as they say " ").

Such a general question, and if this gets closed, I completely understand. But, I seriously need some guidance here.  I have made a decision to put a considerable amount of effort into my own physical health. You know, things like dieting, exercise, and hygiene. My lifestyle has been extremely unhealthy. Almost zero exercise, a wonky sleep schedule, consumption of healthy things only happens about once every 4 months, a treasure trove of junk food, awful hygiene, especially oral hygiene, I rarely brush my teeth unless my mouth feels truly gross and when I'm desperate and short on time, I just do like 10 seconds of Listerine, which I know won't improve anything much, and I never floss. Somehow, I've only had one cavity and none of my teeth have fallen out for the entirety of this lifestyle. I'm sick of feeling gross all the time, and I genuinely WANT to care about my health, I'm just a lazy person, but I'm in a time in my life where I feel like I can really push myself.  The problem with this is: where do I start? I don't think this question can truly be answered. The world of health, especially when it comes to things like weight-loss programs and exercise programs, is so vast that I don't even know if I can take advantage of everything, and then I have to focus on things that will work specifically for ME, since not everything works for everyone. I'm the kind of person who likes to make an extremely detailed and well-defined plan before I go into anything, even if I don't follow through with these plans. Of course, I still tried to do my own research, and even then, I don't entirely trust a lot of online sources, especially if they look scammy, and a lot of these sources focus on getting healthy "fast." I don't care at all about how fast I can become healthy, I care about something that works. Of course, I don't want to like wait, you know, an entire decade to be healthy, but I'm not even gonna consider a link that says "lose 10 pounds in one second guaranteed! Click here!" Also, my doctor just isn't any help at all, since he just provides vague descriptions of health that I'm pretty sure he tells every one of his patients.  My mathematical mind likes to look at the fundamentals first. I don't know if anyone could outline these fundamentals, or provide any sources that look at these fundamentals, and then detail the fundamentals. In fact, I would prefer exterior sources (the freer, the better, this is the internet after all) that can go into way more detail than a quick answer to this question.

It can happen when i am doing nothing strenuous and sat at my desk in work. I am not as active as i was 2 years ago and i have not necessarily gained much weight, but i have gotten slightly 'chubbier' since landing a desk job. I wouldn't describe myself as very unfit, i can run just over 2k without stopping and i recently completed a mountainous 10k run in 1hr 40 minutes. I have spoken to my GP several times about this and they have given me 3 ECG's and performed blood tests at the same time, and they have told me the results were 'nothing out of the ordinary'. They have also given me anti inflammatory medicine as they thought i had pulled muscles between my ribs (very unlikely to last 12 months).

So I understand the need for rabies vaccination "before" exposure since the vaccine basically prepares the immune system, so that in the future should the same intruder enter the body again, the immune system already knows how to handle it. What I dont understand however is the need of an immediate rabies vaccine for a person after he/she has been exposed to rabies virus (bitten, scratched by a rabid dog) , assuming he/she has not been vaccinated before. The rabies virus is already in the saliva of the rabid animal right? and the immune system should already start making the necessary antibodies to counter it right? What's the purpose of injecting a weaker version of the virus if the immune system is going to create the antibodies anyway?  Is the immune system more effective, efficient and quick in creating a solution if it is introduced to a much weaker version of the virus? And after figuring out a "fix", it applies this to the original, strong version of the virus?  Or is the immune system not very responsive to the original virus and it must be "triggered" first to create the necessary "fix" by introducing a weaker version with which it is more responsive? In any case, I'm quite lost on this.-	2017-03-16 23:00:00Z	Johnsy Omniscient	3	0	treatment, vaccination, rabies

When searching Internets for a home-based way to test for Hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid) the so called HCL Challenge is widely suggested. In the HCL Challenge one gradually increases the dosage of HCL pills until a burning in the stomach occurs. If burning occurs with low dosage the acid level in stomach is assumed to be adequate (and vice versa - if burning occurs with a high dosage, one has a deficiency of stomach acid). However, I found one   claiming that this way of testing is wrong, because a burning at a low dosage might also occur when your mucosal barrier is damaged (and your acid level could still be too low in this case). The source isn't backed by any source, however I found similar conclusions in this  . On the other hand, I haven't even manage to find any scientific proof for the whole idea of HCL testing.

Have tried torics and hard contacts	Ive got irregular astigmatism, possibly from years of rubbing my eyes as a child due to allergies. I still get allergies from time to time and rub my eyes.  If I look at letters on paper, every letter has fuzzy borders on top of having a ghost image jutting out at about the 5:30 position (on a clock).  Ive tried toric contact lenses and custom hard contacts, but neither are good. The torics leave my eyes too dry and I've tried a lot of them. They also don't fit right or correct my double vision because my eye shape is too irregular. Hard RGP lenses didn't work because I could see the circular border around them at all times, my doctor said he couldn't go wider, and they got cloudy all the time.  Eyeglasses dont provide clear vision, but they're what I use. Even the phoropter that optometrists use don't have the right combination to correct my vision, so it's been very frustrating telling every optometrist that no combination provides good vision. If I use my finger to push on one side of my eye (changing my eyeballs shape) the vision becomes quite clear. There's still a very apparent second ghost image but the edges of everything becomes sharper. I'm 31. I checked out Lasik but the eye scan said that I have keratoconus and thinning corneas, so they said I didn't qualify for Lasik.  Anyway, I'm out of ideas. I'm worried that as I age I'll effectively become blind due to the un-correctable blurriness of my irregular astigmatism.-4l596gyiawolk	2017-03-16 00:18:50Z	Butterfly and Bones	1	0	optometry, glasses, astigmatism, keratoconus

I didn't seem to do anything different.  How long do hickeys last? What are good ways to promote the healing process?  Since I'm not sure how I managed to give him hickeys since I made out with him as I normally do, how do I prevent future hickeys -- he's pretty embarrassed about it.

When the brain is excited everything is all around better, learning is faster, training is better, socializing is easier and thinking is faster and more coherent. For some, such as myself, however, this is not a natural state, indeed it is very rare. I have, in the past, suffered from major depression, and while I learned to control this seemingly normal state of mind, it seems that much of my brain is still "off" leading me to believe that neuron firing in my brain may be inhibited. Now, I have considered a number of methods for dealing with this problem amoung which are:  All these drugs are seemingly unworkable and in fact, music is the only thing capable of producing excitatory responses in my brain, though they happen rarely and seldom last for longer than a few hours, however the very fact that they happen may be indication that a more permanent excitatory state is possible. Furthermore, I would like to place what you've read thus far into context, I am not looking for a permanent "high" which you might associate with some of the aforementioned drugs, while that may be a dream state for a drug addict, it is not for me. I am simply looking for methods with which I may increase the excitability of my neurons to a point which I deem acceptable for daily life. Whether those methods include psychoactive drugs, psychtropic drugs, dietary plans, meditation or any other method I may have thus far not thought of. In conclusion, I would appreciate any scientifically founded information or useful methods on the matter.-	2017-03-09 03:19:13Z	Butterfly and Bones	4	0	brain, depression, music-therapy

Had a long flight to Cancun Dec 2015, when I arrived my feet and lower legs began to get extremely swollen and red and put me out of commission for the first 3 or 4 days of my vacation.  I saw two doctors there and they couldn't identify it, they thought it was some sort of cellulitis. Ever since that time, I started getting them regularly.  It started occurring monthly (mid=Jan 2016 was the next time) but around Sept '16 it's been daily.  My shoes hardly fit - I don't tie my laces anymore,  - this IS with compression socks warn each day.  The socks used to help, but now the swelling seems to just force the socks to expand, too. I've gone through two primary care doc's in this time, and I had two docs in Cancun look at me.  I've had a rheumatalogist specialist look at it, I've had multiple ultrasounds and X-rays on my legs.  My PCP had me go to the ER in Sept for redness developing and I ended up being checked in for 3 days with bag after bag of different antibiotic IVs (at least 3 or 4 types) and then I was sent home with amoxicillin (which I discovered I was allergic to). Since then, I haven't had a single day where the swelling wasn't there.  I get intense leg cramps, my toes will get sharp pains and go numb/purple sometimes.  The various doctors keep suggesting Buergers and Cellulitis and maybe some other stuff, but I wasn't diagnosed with anything (why not?).  After some time with this and lots of reading, I don't think it's Buergers anymore. I had extremely high IgA and ALT levels on my blood test results 3 times, then suddenly they were normal on the 4th test (not sure if this is anything related).

Urinary tract infection causes dysconfort by giving the urge to urinate even with empty bladder. The one time I had the symptoms (blood in urine, urge to urinate again), I forced myself into drinking too much water so my bladder filled again in a few minutes, so I could urinate. I repeated the process during the course of a few hours, and each time the urine was clearer, and never again I had the symptoms (this was about 4 years ago). Today my girlfriend had the same symptoms, and she used the same procedure. She also went to the hospital, and due to excessive urination, the urine sample she collected for the examination was water-clear. Results came out with no indication of infection, so the doctor sent us home without antibiotics. Is there any study or established knowledge that forcing urination is an effective treatment for UTI?

I have managed to taper myself to a fairly low dose, but can't see myself being able to go off of them in the future. I have seen and talked to multiple doctors, and over the last two years I have tried other medications, but nothing except benzos have worked as well for me: Sertraline, Lithium, Olanzampine, Paroxetine, Fluvoxamine, Imipramine, Fluoxetine, Quetiapine and Bupropion absolutely didn't work.  Others had some benefits that were outweighed by the side effects like (on an efficacy scale): Clomipramine > Venlafaxine > Escitalopram.     While some papers appoint 'em as very harmful in a long term others don't. Some scientists argue that it's related to permanent cognitive loss (although my notes in college improved since I started taking benzos), dementia and so on... while others say that it is just part of marketing campaign to rocket the "z drugs" prescription.

11360	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/11360/leg-apparently-slightly-shorter-after-femur-surgery	Leg apparently slightly shorter after femur surgery	In august 2016 i managed to fall off my bicycle and broke my femur bone (right greater trochanter). It was an accident and nobody else was involved. Urgent surgery followed approx. 12 hours after the accident which left me with a 11x420mm Stryker titanium rod inside the right femur. More or less from the hip down to the knee. Then, 2 weeks hospital care, then home recovery. This went well and i worked with a physical therapist which gradually introduced new exercises, etc. Then I moved to a normal gym which i am still doing after 7 months. I am now almost ok, climbing stairs and walking around, but there is a slight limping i am not able to get rid of. Now during these 7 months there were a few intermediate checks with the doctor and his team. Two times they measured my hip-to-knee distance with a ruler and compared with the other leg, and it seemed to be ok. I didn't know what that really was about at the time. Todays x-ray check showed the fracture well recovered, however the doctor finally concluded that my right leg appears shorter by 5mm. That there's nothing to be done at this point and i should keep doing recovery and possibly try wearing a foot silicone pad inside my right shoe. No more checks have been scheduled and i am free to move on with my life. Now, the questions: Thanks for any kind of insight you could provide!-	2017-03-02 21:54:15Z	Pills N Pillows	3	0	orthopedics, recovery, post-surgical, femur, leg-length-discrepancy

I have omitted chronic diseases as a group, although they are projected to increase from 90 million (1995) to 168 million by 2025. The confluence of aggravators work too well together: quality of life, disposable income, percentage of those depressed, number of those with multimorbidities, and the fact that the incidence shows no signs of stopping. We may be looking at a snowball effect: If the workforce is undergoing constant depletion and is being increasingly transformed into a burden, the economy will start to shrink, and this will hasten the process of depletion of the remaining workforce. Access to health care will begin to decrease, further hastening disintegration of health, economy and living standards. I think it is abundantly clear looking at the chart below that life expectancy has no chance of increasing by 2025, but the question is how much will it decrease and how quickly?

11325	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/11325/murkyaggitated-final-stage-last-hour-of-sleep	Murky&aggitated final stage (last hour) of sleep	I am posting this hoping that others who are having similar sleep disorders will maybe want to share their experience. I apologise for what seems to've become a very long thread - I tried to stick to the most relevant details. For about a year and a half I've been suffering from a specific type of sleep problem. The last part of my sleep, towards the morning (perhaps the final hour or so; hard to tell exactly) is very agitated; feels like a dizziness, as if I had mud in my head, and where I am half-awake (almost conscious/obsessive dream-like thoughts reoccur) yet find it difficult to wake up. This means that, after a struggle to break away from a confusing, exhausting last hour of sleep, not only will I have spent longer in bed than I'd have wished (say, 9 hours) but "in exchange" I get a day during which I am often tired, and sometimes find it hard to stay awake longer than 10pm. "Tricking" myself out of sleep before the critical stage starts (e.g. after 7 hours of sleep) doesn't work, as then I just feel under-slept. Other (even more upsetting) side-effects of this long-standing sleep disorder include irritablility and apathy to exercise and to sex. In addition, I seem to've acquired a form of tinitus (high-pitched buzz in both ears), the severity (loudness) of which varies from day to day, though hard to tell if correlated with sleep quality. Several medical tests (including ear-nose-throat, endocrinology and head MR-imaging) revealed no obvious cause underlying my symptoms, however a sleep study (polysomnography) revealed two presumtive (tentatively-given) diagnoses:  1) REM sleep disorder (although I don't have the intense dreams characteristic of this diagnostic) 2) borderline sleep apnea (several episodes of irregular breathing per night).  After this test, my somnologist prescribed Circadin 2mg (melatonin), which I've been taking for a month now without any noticeable improvements even after being told to double the dosage; the medic recommended, if the Circadin treatment remains ineffective till the end, that I next try to sleep with an anti-apneic mask (CPAP). If that will fail also, she said the only remaining cause remains stress; I haven't been particularly stressed times, however I   tend to take things to heart. Some further details: - Taking natural sleep supplements (camomile tea, pills with lavander, etc) before bedtime helps sometimes but not reliably (probably not beyond placebo) - My sleep is abnormally dependent upon bed-time, in that if I go to bed late (a lot later than, say, midnight) I am guaranteed a tormented sleep. However, even going to bed early (11pm) hardly helps with the final-hour-restlessness that I describe. - I'm keeping careful sleep logs, however none of the factors I suspected - including amount of exercise (which I don't do enough of) and stress during the previous day, bed/pillow conditions, bed time, anything to do with meals (including coffee), etc - don't seem to obviously (and single-handedly) lead to this final-hour-syndrome - Soon after falling asleep, I am told I often fidget/twitch and snore, although I never have trouble   asleep (only at the waking-up end) - Since 1.5 years ago when my problems started, the frequency with which my sleep ends with such a restless hour varies: I've had a few good months/weeks, but otherwise it's rare (maybe one night out of 10) that I   get the symptom, i.e. when I wake up easily and rested. - My sleep hours are normally regular (midnight to 8am) I am male, mid 30s, no other major health problems. If anyone has encountered similar symptoms and can share any advice of what they tried that worked, I'd be really grateful!

More specifically, does gargling help prevent sickness when a person   the early-stages of being sick? (That slight feeling of rawness in one's throat, for example, or a light, abnormal fatigue).  A friend of mine says that gargling during this stage has worked wonders to prevent oncoming sickness. The argument made is that one absorbs the offending bacteria/viruses via the respiratory tractand gargling with an antiseptic kills off otherwise sickness-causing pathogens. For example, if wearing a mask helps prevent sickness by blocking pathogens from the throat, why wouldn't using an anti-septic on the throat directly similarly prevent sickness? I think this is a biological oversimplification. I claim that, by the time a person feels   symptoms, said person is already sick and gargling won't help prevent further sickness.  study claims that gargling with   as a   measure (i.e. - before feeling any rawness, irritation, inflammation, or fatigue) reduces the occurrence of respiratory tract infections. While I don't think it's quite relevant in this question, it's the most related thing I could find.

I'm sorry if this is an obvious question. I frequently have migraine attacks, and have to take some pills to stop the pain. Now my question is, does a pill stop the source of an attack, or does it just stop my brain from feeling it? Let's make a clear example: You have a broken bone, you take a very powerful painkiller (or maybe even injection), so you can't feel the pain in your broken arm anymore. But still, if you apply pressure on the bone, it will still damage the body, regardless of feeling it or not. So it's not curing the bone, it's just preventing you from feeling it. Now when i have these attacks, i need to stay in dark and rest (as you already know what is a migraine attack), and if i still continue to (for example) use my computer, it will hurt more and more with each second passing. This is an alert from my brain:  Now i know a simple pill won't cure a major wound or a broken arm,but still, does these medicines cure a headache, or i will still damage my body by continuing my things when i have an attack and take a pill which stops the pain almost instantly?-	2017-02-23 09:15:40Z	Butterfly and Bones	2	0	headache, migraine, nsaids-pain-meds, analgesic-pain-killer, acetaminophen-pain-meds

My mother, a school science teacher, is of the opinion that the common cold gains its name from the fact that you can acquire a cold virus more readily when you yourself feel cold. For example, in her view, if you were to spend a day in a cold temperature with inadequate clothing, or spend a long time standing in a rainstorm, you'd increase your chance of catching a cold. I can see the potential for this to be true - if your body is at an inadequate temperature, it might be more susceptible to catching a cold (or anything for that matter) as your body is busy trying to keep you warm rather than protecting you from disease. I argue with her, however, as I understand the name of the Common Cold to be referring to the most common symptom of it, in that it makes your body feel cold, causing you to wear extra clothing. Could someone please enlighten me as to how the Common Cold actually takes its name, is it one of the above alternatives, or something else entirely? As a bonus, is there actually any merit to my mother's logic - is it actually easier to catch a cold when you're physically colder than your body would prefer?-	2017-02-22 10:56:43Z	wattostudios	2	0	common-cold

If I leave some ground beef in my fridge for more than a day or two, it becomes visibly different, it browns, and just looks less appealing. I've been told that for ground meats it is especially important to cook them all the way through because even the insides have been exposed to bacteria in contrast to say a steak. When I apply the same logic to sausages, it seems pretty bad. They are also made from ground meats, but because of the casing it is much more difficult to see if the meat inside is going bad. It seems to me that people keep sausages in their fridge for far longer than they would keep ground beef or other ground meats. For instance, sometimes my roommate has sausages in the fridge for 2 weeks or so, and I really wonder if that is okay or not.

Almost 2 years ago I got a knee injury (ACL and meniscal tear) which left me with a mechanically locked knee for more than a month. I could still walk normally without much instability. Fortunately, my doctor suggested physiotherapy which got back the original knee movement and restored part of the muscle strength (not full strength though) Right after that, I got a scholarship to a PhD program in China so I didn't do anything to it at first. Last year I rechecked with 2 doctors in somewhat reputable hispitals in Xi'an China, both of them concluded after checking my MRI results and performing physical tests that surgery isn't needed (or that it is not worth it) but I will have to stay away from competetive sports. Now my concern is mostely related to my healthy knee, which hurts me when I put weight on it or if I do activities like jogging.  So to get to my question :  is it possible that my injured leg got a bit longer (maybe caused by weak muscles or loose ligament)? Or is it that I relied on my left side for too long until its muscles became tight which developped a lateral pelvic tilt? If that's the case, should I see a doctor? Or someone with other profession (could you offer an exact name of the profession, so I try to translate it to Chinese) Recap : - Injured right knee with weak muscles. - Left leg feels shorter (or right leg longer) which causes pain in healthy (Left) knee.

Oxytocin is released through social interactions and has manifold benefits, some of which are sleep and pain. This   article ascribes that one of the benefits is sleep: In articles elsewhere, it mentions that  . Thus...

Me and my team are planning to go to a Dementia based Hackathon early March and since this is our first actual hackathon we were wondering if you could provide some advice regarding our idea. Here's some background on our team and idea. Our Team: It consists of four people, three of whom are second year Computer Science students and me. We are all beginners - novices at programming and can somewhat use python. Only one of our friends is comfortable enough with Java so we won't be able to use an android app. Our Idea: To create a game for dementia patients where we help them retain their memories and cognitive function by asking them to select the right picture of something. For example, if they would like to remember what a traffic light is we would get a couple of pictures from google images (one which is the actual traffic light) and ask them to select the right picture. In our theory this will help reduce the regression of cognitive function by helping patients retain their memory through a fun game and possibly stimulate neurogenesis.  Since only of one of us knows Java we are planning to create a Web based game instead of an android app. Some Issues: We are wondering on what basis we should be asking the questions ( For example, how would we know that most dementia patients need to remember what a traffic light is?). Another thing is I was wondering if we could somehow collect the data from patients playing the game and do some analysis or show it to a professional so they can assess their cognitive function. However, would that be too advanced for us programming wise (we are only beginners programming wise)? Note: Since this stack exchange is mainly based on health just providing some advice on our idea would help a lot (like how good it is, some tips to make it better, etc.), although if you have some experience with programming and would like to give us advice as well that would also be great. Although I think I will go to SO after to get programming specific advice.-	2017-02-15 22:05:15Z	DreamVision2017	2	1	mental-health, brain, prevention, computers, dementia

I've often heard/read that brown rice is a better choice over white rice, because it contains the germ and the bran and so has higher levels of fibre, protein, fatty acids and so on... Unfortunately it takes quite a while longer to cook and doesn't really go well with some of the foods I like to eat with rice, so I usually stick to either basmati or parboiled rice... and feel guilty (I don't really, but it makes for a better story). So I go into the shop and pick up three varieties of rice of the supermarket's own brand, i.e. all similar packaging/labelling, easily comparable nutritional information (all values per 100g as sold, i.e. dry, uncooked), take a photo of the nutritional information, and I find this: Basmati rice:    Parboiled long grain rice:   Long grain brown rice: So this brown rice, which everybody knows as being high-fibre, contains just under 12% more fibre than parboiled rice? And a whopping 27% more fibre than basmati rice, which is about the whitest looking rice you can find? Is that it? It also seems to have the lowest protein content of all the rice varieties looked at here, how is that? I'm really confused by this.

Especially in this time of the year, influenza infections that cause fever are quite common. I would presume that the body heats up in order to kill off bacteria (similar as to why we boil water, and cook food). This doesn't really make much sense when it comes to viruses, as they do not have a similar metabolism.  Still, one symptom of influenza is pyrexia, so I conclude that pyrexia is triggered in some part of the immune system which does not differentiate between a viral and bacterial infection. I imagine pyrexia to be the body's standard response to an intruder of any kind. Am I right here? I also do have 2 follow up questions:  How does our body increase the temperature?

So a claim that something is "naturally" fat-free sounds appealing. But how can quark be naturally fat-free, when other dairy products are not? Is it just a marketing ploy? An example: You start with full fat milk, you add rennet, you get curds, you drain the whey, you get cheese. Considered naturally high fat. You start with full fat milk, you add some lactic bacteria, you get yoghurt. Considered naturally (relatively) high fat (to the extent that we now "make" low-fat ones).

I was learning about   and I noticed that it said that one of the symptoms was "neck and shoulder pain". What confuses me is that CVS (or digital eye strain) seem to be a problem experienced by the  . However the neck and shoulders don't seem to be muscles very related to the eyes but rather it seems that discomfort in these would be caused by bad posture rather than anything to do with the eyes. If that is the cause how does eye strain causes discomfort in the shoulders or neck or visa versa?  As anecdotal experience (I know its not scientific evidence but it might be the cause of my confusion), whenever I've personally experienced digital eye strain the major discomfort for me has been from the upper part of my eyes or headaches. I think my neck has felt a bit stiff but I find it hard to believe that there is actually some causation between the two, specially because the neck pain is an order of magnitude smaller.  Does someone with more knowledge on this can explain this phenomenon? If the relation between eye strain and neck pain is real it seems that if I were to look down say and bend my neck for a prolonged period of time, that should cause eye strain or if I over use my eyes (by looking at the same thing for long time, say a screen) then my neck should hurt. But it doesn't seem that any information travels from the eye to the neck to the brain (rather more directly to the brain).  So essentially with my mental model of how things work, it seems that neck/shoulders issue are more common accompanied to computer vision syndrome due because people that look at screens a lot might also have bad habits of posture but it doesn't seem there an actual causation of one to the other.

It is common for Colorado front rangers to ascend up a 14,000+ ft peak in one day starting from Denver @ ~5,500. I myself just this last weekend went from Colo Springs (~6,100) to Monarch ski resort and summited on Murkwood Point which is 12,500 feet, thus doubling my elevation in one day. It seems the difference between the climbers outlined in the article and weekend warriors like myself are that most of us don't sleep up at these altitudes. We go ski or hike and come back down that same day, spending no more than 6 hours above 12,000 feet; the article says you can contract brain damage even if you don't feel symptoms...  I'm curious if climbing to    is enough to trigger brain damage; in more detail, is someone coming from sea level up to 8000ft equally as bad as someone going from 8000 to 16000 (since it is 8000 altitude gain either way)? Or does it get exponentially worse the higher you get? Just want to be careful, because like I said above, it is   for people to ascend 6,000 - 8,000 feet in a day, e.g. doing 14ers in Colorado and in my mind, this isn't work risking your brain permanently... however, I wouldn't mind if the symptoms go away when I descend.-	2017-02-02 02:50:11Z	Pills N Pillows	2	0	exercise, brain, irreversible-damage, organ-damage, altitude-sickness

10892	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/10892/how-can-i-bypass-the-most-expensive-drug-in-the-world-which-goes-on-sale-and-get	How can I bypass the most expensive drug in the world which goes on sale and get cured?	I have an ALS-like disease called SMA type III. It's a progressive neurodegenerative disease and there was no cure until recently. I have been waiting for a cure for forty years. Thanks to technological advances in medicine, a pharmaceutical company in the USA developed a cure based on antisense oligonucleotide technology. Its name is Spinraza, it's proved to be effective in treatment and FDA approved it, it's on sale now but it's the most expensive drug in the world, about 75000$ per vial and I read that I need 8 intrathecal injections at least. Since it's at exorbitant price I need to look for alternative medicines.  Let me give a brief info about my disease: It affects motor neurons in the spinal cord. Unlike ALS, upper motor region in the brain is not affected. And unlike ALS, the cause of the disease is known. I began to feel the symptoms when I was three years old. I had weak muscle tone, weakness and atrophy developed, so I can not use voluntary muscles effectively, I needed to exert much efforts to do simple movements in the early stages of the disease. What reduced me to paralysis  stems from deletion of codons from SMN1 gene located in 5th chromosome at 5q13 locus. Luckily another identical backup gene exists in the same chromosome called SMN2 but it unluckily has a single nucleotide transition from   to  , so it turns out to be a stop codon. As a result of that mutation, SMN protein can not include the "end parts" named   so it produces short-lived not fully functional  protein which is essential for motor neurons.  Clinical trials concentrated on inducing   mechanism to bypass the stop codon on mRNA during protein synthesis. Trials proved that it's feasible.  Another treatment approach is gene therapy. What do you propose in  my situation?

The disease was cured and I have had no sequels or long term effects that I know of, leading an active life, doing sports, yoga and so on. Now in my fifties I'm beginning to have issues of backpain. The medical tests put it down to ageing but (now the question) could it be long-term effects of  the childhood TB?

Eventually I'm planning to go work at a facility (gym, possibly pulmonary rehab) with trainers and machines. At the moment, I'm hooked up to a stationary oxygen compressor with limited movement and mostly confined to my bed and desk. So, I have very limited range of movement or open space to exercise in. But I want to start building up my strength ASAP, especially since I'm working from home all day with plenty of free time to do it. I have using small hand weights doing lateral raises (I think? arms lifting straight out at the shoulder), as I have plenty of room out to the side. But in front, I don't really have enough room to properly do curls. Instead I have been rotating my arms 180 degrees so they face outward, and doing curls up to my side instead of up to my chest.

The material must retain its magnetic ability and I've seen studies on their ability to "remember" waves that are subjected to it (as some ferromagnetic compound can do). It would be good if the shielding did not block against very low earth magnetic beneficial vibrations(Schumann resonance of 7.83 Hz ,etc),but I think ferromagnetics do.

Theoretically, if one had the majority of the symptoms for Lupus, and even tested positive for SLE via a ANA blood test result, but still hasn't had a "Butterfly" rash ever to appear -- could they still be medically diagnosed with Lupus?  My Rhematologist was telling me that he does not diagnose anyone with Lupus unless they eventually develop a "Butterfly rash" -- otherwise he just diagnoses people that have all the Lupus symptoms (except the Butterfly), even if they tested positive for Lupus in the blood-work, as "fibromyalgia." To him, the Butterfly rash is the single most important hinge that swings a fibromyalgia diagnosis to a lupus diagnosis.   But everywhere I look online, not everyone that is positive for Lupus will experience the "Butterfly" Rash. Right? Or am I wrong?

I have an atrophic scar about 4cm to the right of my lip. I wanted to get subcision but the plastic surgeon said there's a risk of damaging the buccal nerve which would then mean I wouldn't be able to speak properly.  He said it's risky because I don't have much collagen in that area.  1) How deep is the dermis and epidermis in that region? 2) is the Buccal nerve right below the epidermis or is it protected by a muscle or another layer? 3) How deep would you need to go to hit the buccal nerve? 4) Would a dermapen that goes 2.5mm deep hit the buccal nerve if the skin in that area is not very thick due to collagen loss?-	2017-01-19 04:48:15Z	Butterfly and Bones	1	0	face, plastic-surgery

I know there are already questions related to this (e.g.  ) and I'm not here to debate whether OMAD is a worthwhile diet or not. Rather, I'd like to get some input on what the makeup of that single meal should be. I've seen many people suggest the OMAD diet without recommending any specific meal plan/breakdown I saw   discussing how/why OMAD works. If I understand this correctly, by only eating a single meal glucose/insulin levels in your body are allowed to drop, and ketosis is allowed to start providing more stable energy release throughout the day and to use up energy stored in fat cells. Is that a correct understanding? Given that, is it advisable to eat a carb heavy single meal? I would imagine that would cause glucose levels to spike - does that then get stored back into fat cells thus preventing weight loss?

I am simply a hypochondriac who, in general, wishes to learn more about his afflictions. I had previously been diagnosed, by a physician, with Gilbert's Syndrome. They came to the conclusion after a blood test showed that I had elevated bilirubin levels, and a follow-up blood test was performed, showing that my bilirubin levels had decreased on their own without intervention. What I thought had been unrelated was the fact that I generally have a lower platelet count, though it fluctuates, but stays on the lower end of the range of what is a normal range. I know, as well, that my mother has this same issue with her platelet count and that it also slightly decreases every year, and there has never been a significant jump from what I know. I am not sure, however, if she has Gilbert's syndrome as well, but I am aware that it can be inherited genetically, so it is possible that she might. For a while I had been wondering about the cause of my platelet counts, and had finally stumbled upon one source which claimed that Gilbert's Syndrome can cause decreased platelet counts (and MPV). I am wondering if someone could explain a little more, hopefully in simpler terms, as to why Gilbert's Syndrome might cause a decreased platelet count and if this could be the reason that I typically have a lower platelet count.-	2017-01-19 05:11:42Z	Butterfly and Bones	0	0	blood-tests, liver, platelet-count, bilirubin

Due to some problems with my insurance, I can only get an appointment in mid February. From experience, I know that eventually the tooth will start to hurt by itself witouth any stimulus. My question is, what can I do to delay this stage of pain as much as possible? Should I brush my teeth an excessive number of times a day? Should I floss around that tooth often? Should I use mouthwash? Of course this is generally good advice, but I am afraid that since the cavity is so close to the nerve already, excessive brushing of teeth may help the bacteria dig towards the nerve faster.

10685	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/10685/does-drinking-water-increase-the-risk-of-shock-with-an-open-wound	Does drinking water increase the risk of shock with an open wound?	First let me explain the scenario:  Someone received an open wound, lets assume from a cut so no blunt-forced trauma meaning no reason to suspect internal injuries. The wound is bad enough that serious blood loss occurs. This happens in a remote place, so medevac and professional health care, are if at all available, delayed by days. A good first aid kit is available, but nothing like IVs. Initial wound care has been done (this is not the part I am interested in here, assume it has been done correctly). Obviously the patient will need hydration. The question is whether hydration should be delayed or not?  Broken down: Does drinking water have any detrimental effect in terms of stopping the bleeding and chances to get into a state of shock?   Typical unspecific first aid recommendations state to not give a patient anything to drink. If a reason is given for this, it is usually that the patient might need surgery. This is not an issue in this case. Also with food it is clear that it is a bad idea, as digestion "needs blood", same for water? There is a (seemingly dubious)   where someone states that it will "only dilute the blood" and it is again more directed at internal injuries. And AFAIK it is a normal procedure to give a trauma victim fluids over IV before blood transfusions are available, so this seems wrong to me.-	2017-01-09 18:42:13Z	Pills N Pillows	1	0	first-aid, hydration, bleeding

After the test, she will just quickly scan the results, tell me that the results are fine, there is no cure for tinnitus, and then give me generic advice like "try turning on the fan when you sleep to mask the noise". My actual consultation time (not counting the hearing test time) is probably 15 mins or less, and I am charged $200+ for this (which is the standard rate in Australia apparently). I have no clue what this test is supposed to show in the first place (the specialist claims it can detect whether my ears are damaged, is this true?). Isn't there a more indepth test to find out what is causing the tinnitus exactly? I can't believe that I am being charged $200+ just to be told to "try turning on the fan".

Over the last year his manic states have progressively become worst, lasting longer, and he has become more delusional. Right now he has been in a manic state for nearly three months. He is suffering severe delusions of grandeur. He thinks he is time traveling, and that he has hacked the universe through the Internet and is now one with everything and has been saving the universe, and all of us in it. He thinks he is the head of an Internet crime organization, regularly talks with Vladimir Putin, blew up our home town multiple times with the help of terminators, and is doing breakthrough physics work is his basement (he's not even proficient in high school math). He thinks that he is worth millions of dollars even though he is broke. He is spending any spare money he has on items of no value, thinking they are sound investments. I could go on and on with his delusions. He does live with someone who helps him, has control of his Social Security Checks, pays his bills, etc, but this person has no obligation to do this, and I am afraid that he will alienate him and won't have anyone to help take care of him in the near future. He refuses to be on any type of medication. He was committed for a few months, a few years ago, but a judge thought he was not a harm at that time so he was released. I think that has changed. I am afraid that he might harm himself trying to transcend this dimension or something to that effect. Or that someone else may hurt him if he approaches a stranger that doesn't know he is not a physical threat. He needs to be hospitalized and put on medication, but he won't go to the hospital or take medicine when a doctor tried to give it to him. My question is, what can I do to help my friend? What can I do to get him the help that he needs, or convince him to accept help that is offered. I am afraid for his safety, and I know that if he accepted help his mental health, his quality of life would improve. I miss my friend and I want him to be safe and have his mind back, or at least be more lucid and grounded in reality. He has lost touch with reality right now, is not sleeping, bathing, eating right, etc. Please help. We live in Franklin County Ohio if that helps with any questions regarding legality.

Sorry I couldn't find a better title but by this question I'm not really looking for a cure. I'm just curious to know what happened to me and in my body. So I would never enjoy food except a couple of dishes everything else used to taste terrible, maybe I should say I didn't like to eat. I would only eat to live and as soon as I feel I don't need it I would stop. Then I went to see a doctor and he was Endocrinologist. He prescribed me these medicines: After a week or so the world was totally different. Anything I would eat, tasted awesome. I  would finish my dishes enjoyably. Even those dishes that I used to vomit by just looking at them was tasting incredible. Within 4 weeks i gained nearly 15 kilos (I was too skinny, only 48kg and 174 cm)  After 9 months or so the doctor reduced the dosage and I gradually stopped taking them. However 3 years later, I moved to Australia and again gradually I turned back to old days.  It's not as bad as old days but I again lost weight. I am always reluctant to have lunch and I push myself to eat. Even doing activities doesn't change my appetite really only a little that's not noticeable.  So my questions are: The first question is more important to me as I am very curious person about how things work. Thanks. Please note I'm not looking for advice. P.S.

After five minutes she's out. This represents the perfect behaviour for bedtime process. But, she does this at 1:00 AM and sometimes even 2:30 AM and pretty much every night. The fact that she has school the morning after does not change that behaviour. Her overall productivity is not impaired. She can study math at 11:00 at night with very good concentration. She does not feel the fatigue.  She plays competitive Basketball, Volleyball, does ballet and pretty much every activity school offers. She's a pretty busy bee and feels great about it. In the morning, she a bit grumpy and her overall respect for her parents is declining. But I would say, this is a general pattern in teenagers.  Studies are clear, living this way for all her life will hurt her overall health.  Now what?  Should I force her to go to bed earlier? I have tried both, forcing and let-go and she won't change her strange habit. I like the let-go approach because my relationship with her is way better. If I force her to go to bed earlier, she fights back and argues...I loose every time. So the let-go choice is better but I feel very bad because she might be arming herself.   Is there any scientific studies explaining how to deal with this type of teenager? I think forcing brings so much frustrations on both parts that it may impair our overall health in the long run; even more than bad sleeping patterns.-	2017-02-02 20:19:13Z	Pills N Pillows	1	0	sleep, sleep-cycles, sleep-deprivation, psychology-psychology, adolescents-teenagers

First three times we tried to have intercourse she felt so much pain and each time she bled (not much), till now each time we try penetration she feel intolerable pain and screams VERY loudly (to the point that i get scared for her well-being). I tried to insert my finger there, it went smoothly with some minor discomfort on her side, then i tried 2 fingers, it went through also with some minor pain. We tried to apply an Anesthetic Gel (Lidocaine) on her hymen area, but it didn't help the pain. Also we tried "Durex Play" lube but she felt very bad burning (obviously "Play" does not Play nice with cuts) At this point i'm out of ideas and don't know what to do. 2-My second problem is: We take our time during foreplay, mostly i give her oral (around 15-20 mins), during that time i'm rock hard, when she gets really wet and i try to penetrate, the moment i approach and get in the right position, i got flaccid  :( it is like magic ! It is happening every time now ! Any help regarding the 2 problems would be much appreciated :(-	2016-12-21 13:36:15Z	Kal211	-2	0	gynaecology

Why?	I started eating Asian food rather frequently about 3 years ago.  I like hot and spicy dishes. I have no problem eating for example a Vietnamese Pho with lots of chilis in it. Also, I love to prepare my own food (of any origin) using lots of different types of oil. However, if I only get to eat one drop of chili oil, my body starts to take it seriously.  It started when I first made chili oil myself and put a good amount of it in my meal. A few hours afterwards, my heart started beating fast and strong and that did not stop until about   later! It felt like it was pounding during an adrenalin rush, maybe not as strong but without end. I could hardly sleep. No relaxation technique helped.  Also, my stomach didn't do too good, but it was not bad. The problem was my heart and the unrest it caused me. This was as bad as it ever got. Since then I got the occasional unintentional load of chili oil in restaurants. The symptoms are the same, but weaker and shorter (12-20 hours maybe). I assume in those cases it is just not as much chili oil as it was at the first time. Maybe a quick explanation of how chili oil is made. It is really simple. You put several sliced red chilis (with seeds) into olive oil and let it steep for a few weeks. That's all. Afterwards you use the oil directly from the container it was made in. What can cause this? What is different with the oil compared to the single ingredients?-	2016-12-20 16:01:12Z	Sebastian	1	0	nutrition, stomach, heart

My own view is that this is not enough evidence of a causal link between the disease and the use of aluminium foil in contact with food, so I am not going to stop using it.

10514	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/10514/performing-valsalva-maneuver-with-partly-open-airway	Performing Valsalva maneuver with partly open airway?	The Valsalva maneuver is defined as " " or " ".  Some breathing practices involve pushing air out against resistance, such as   in yoga or the slow, controlled exhale recommended by some weightlifting coaches. This can be done by partly closing the glottis while exhaling, or by firmly exhaling through the mouth with lips slightly open, as if one were whistling. Unlike the definitions above, the patient does not have a fully closed airway and is still taking in oxygen. But subjectively, this kind of breathing feels like it's raising intrathoracic and eustachian pressure in the same way as Valsalva.  Does forcefully exhaling against resistance have similar physiological effects to the Valsalva maneuver? Are there differences caused by the fact that the patient is still breathing, or by the fact that this maneuver can be maintained and repeated for much longer than a "strict" Valsalva?-	2017-03-10 18:08:11Z	Butterfly and Bones	1	0	breathing, pressure, valsalva-maneuver

Is there any medical value when a care provider talks to a trauma patient to keep the patient conscious? It's well known that in cases of trauma (in physical medicine) always the paramedic or physician would try to talk to the patient in order to keep him or her conscious. It's known also from movies as the sentence "Stay with me, man!" etc. Is there any medical value to do that? While it doesn't seem to matter to talk someone that lost a lot of blood, if the patient will lose consciousness, they will lose it with or without conversation. The only medical value that I can think about, is just to observe and monitor the patient but not as a tool to keep them conscious. Is that right?  I would like to see any scientific reference that supports the claim that it helps actively to keep the patient conscious, if any. -	2016-12-11 02:31:33Z	Ubiquitous Student	6	1	emergency, emt

I've looked at dozens of websites, more than half associated with universities, and I still can't figure out which foods are high in purine and which are not.  What I do is try to compare the purine content, like per 100 grams, and go from there.  But many guidelines don't give you the number, and instead say which ones are "high" and which are "medium" or which are "safe" to eat and which not.  For instance mushroom has been mentioned as both high purine and low purine.  One site mentions tuna as something to be avoided while another says it's safe to eat.  Some sites mention the actual purine content but only for a limited number of food (and I'm not sure how accurate their numbers are, given that other sites don't agree).  For instance, Wiki links to this (non university) page which gives purine content for limited number of food:  In any event, I'd appreciate it if you could link me to a paper or book or site that is both comprehensive and accurate, in terms of listing purine content of different kinds of food.

(  can be anything you like: cancer, insanity, arthritis, sarcasm etc, doesn't matter, I'm more interested in the availability of information). I was baffled by this question.  Surely my medical records tell him who my parents/grandparents are, and therefore what my medical history is.  Why is he asking me directly if he has the database at his fingertips?  It's not like he's just making conversation. My parent's sure don't tell me what ails them and I'm sure their parents didn't encumber them likewise.  My own personal knowledge is certainly out-of-date, incomplete and unreliable at best! If anyone knows the answer to his question, then it's his computer screen, right? Is he just too damn lazy to look it up?  Or doesn't he have access to my family information?  Either way seems very worrying.

Here is my readings in one day: 160/97 150/100 After 5 min of walking in a street: 130/80 After 5 min of walking in a street: 120/90 After 5 min of walking in a street: 125/85 Does that make sense?

I did a cursory search but it didn't yield any viable information. Putting regular stress on various parts of the human body and its systems seems to have an overall strengthening effect. Working out builds stronger muscle, microdosing poison gets you some immunity to poison, bone microfractures lead to denser and stronger bone and so on, gradually and continuously working out various parts and systems of the body appears to have a beneficial effect on their performance. So what would be the effect of subjecting the organism to continuous alcohol microdosing? And I don't mean "drink a little once a day" but adding a minuscule amount of alcohol to water and other consumed liquids, dosed according to the liver's performance so that the alcohol level doesn't exceed the legal limits you can drive a vehicle with, perhaps even significantly lower than that. If poison microdosing builds up immunity to poison, and I am only assuming that it is being metabolized by the liver and thus improves its ability to metabolize poison, wouldn't alcohol microdosing too make up for a stronger liver? I've also read about studies which show conflicting results, while some appear do indicate there are some benefits to drinking a little alcohol (but not microdosing), others claim that drinking any amount of alcohol is detrimental to the health, but again, that means drinking recreationally, not microdosing.-	2016-11-20 21:02:49Z	dtech	3	0	alcohol, liver, metabolism

My coworker and I were having a discussion over the rate of alcohol absorption.  He argued that after you reach x number of drinks, your body stops passing as much ethanol into the bloodstream because it "knows" when your blood is too saturated with ethanol. He didn't say that ethanol would not be entirely blocked from entering the blood stream, just that the rate would slow down the more you drank.  Is there any truth to this? -	2016-11-16 23:32:10Z	Prince	1	0	alcohol, drug-metabolism, ethanol, blood-alcohol-levels

I'm an archaeologist, but I am not the Indiana Jones type (tall and brawny) -- but rather, a very petite female (4'9" to be precise). One might say, that I lack the muscle tone and strength to do all the physical labor one would expect from an archaeologist, and they are certainly accurate. But what I lack in physical strength, I make up for in my small stature (and brains -- at least in terms of archaeology). For instance, I am often the only one on the team able to fit and crawl into tiny tomb openings and document the archaeological site lurking underneath the surface, or slide down into a tight pit and document an artifact, or squeeze inside an ancient chamber and able to report back to the rest of the team what I have discovered. Tight spaces have never been an issue for me.  However, on a day-off from excavating in Egypt, myself and a few crew members went to the Pyramids of Giza, of course. We had the opportunity to enter and all of us fared the "Ascending Passage" with ease, though my   started muttering complaints about how tight it was (but no one thought anything of it because it was indeed tight... but we all expected that... and none of us really cared all that much because we were in the FREAKIN' PYRAMIDS).

10151	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/10151/explain-my-reaction-to-clove	Explain my reaction to clove	I was 10 years old when I had my first experience with cloves.  The family had just moved into a new house, which had been vacant for a while and thus a little musty.  My mom went for groceries and returned with a can of whole cloves.  She spread them all around- in each closet, cupboard, kitchen drawer, even under furniture just before it was set in place.  My reaction was quick.  I could not even enter the kitchen where the greatest amount had been spread.  Everywhere else in the house I still felt ill- a significant headache and mild nausea.  I was able to sleep in my room, which was upstairs and there were no cloves there, but otherwise I spent most of that September either at school or playing outside. Now I am 45, and just today a co-worker a couple of cubicles over went to dab a bit of clove oil on himself, and instead spilled it on himself.  The smell quickly filled the team space, and I was instantly uncomfortable.  I took a long "coffee break" hoping the place would air itself out, and when I returned I was okay for a while.  By lunch I knew I had to leave.  I explained the situation to the boss and took a WFH afternoon (I am "at work" right now!)  It's been an hour and although my head is clear, I still have a tinge of nausea. I've never seen a doctor about this, because for the most part I've taken a "if it hurts when you do that, then don't do that" point of view and simply avoid cloves.  Even when I had the situation at age 10, my parents ignored it- they probably figured, "What an easy way to get him out of our hair."  Today's episode makes we wonder if I should see a doctor, however. I don't think the symptoms fit calling this an allergy.  I described it to my co-workers and boss as "sensitivity."  I wonder if anyone has had a similar experience, or can explain why I have this reaction and if there is a solution beyond simple avoidance?

I have never seen any kind of professional advisor, because I thought I could cope with my problems, until recently. I post it here, because somebody might be in a similar situation seeking help, too. I was a shy, introverted guy at primary school and in college, and still am. I did not and do not drink alcohol at all, though am planning to have a nice first beer with my brother. Maybe it could have allowed me to relax in the past and party/make other people know me more, I do not know. I am not sure how relevant this may be, but my parents divorced 14 years ago. My brother was in his teens when that occured and he was devastated but I also endured a kind of a breakdown around a similar age as he did. My brother moved out very early. I stayed with my mother who has got a hell of a lot insecurities and I would often sink in her problems and try to fix her relationship with her parents (my mom is a teacher (working) and her parents also are (retired)). When I was 15, I had such a row with my mother that I almost fainted and an ambulance would take me. I moved out from her to her parents, which futher worsened their relation. This is sad to state, but I would rather confide in and trust a random person than anyone from my family, which is one of the reasons why I post this question here. I am considered a mature, wise and intelligent person but I have trouble getting along with people, especially with women. I feel as though they can feel the bad vibe the second they see me and do not want to continue discussion, not saying of going on a date. I do not want to blame my mother, but I am inclined to believe it has taken some toll on me, because I can not stay with her for longer than 2-3 hours. We would talk normally, but after some time something inside of me would tell me to flee. I feel very sorry for her, and regret having told her about how I have felt about this, but she was pushing me to tell her why I had felt the way I had. At school, I have always felt alone even though I had friends. Things like being chosen last on PE lessons would not bother me much then, but such relatively small nuisances are now re-emerging and cumulating. Now, at the university, I have problems concentrating and can not put up with sad emotions, that is too much for me. I am afraid I will not make it to the 4th semester, and am even more afraid to tell my parents about it. Simple tasks are becoming overwhelmingly difficult to such an extent that I refrain from attending classes because I see no point in me going to them. I used to vent bad emotions by crying and I was used to it, because it seemed to have worked, at least for some time. But now, I can see it is deepening and last two times I felt I was a danger to myself. I thought I was tough enough to get over this, but I feel that that strength is diminishing. At times I feel completely detached from my closest relatives, as though no bonds ever really existed. I do not know if this is insecurity, or me not being able to spot them because I try to suppress anything. Constant fear for the future and reminiscences of the past are very exhausting and debilitating. More and more often I can not help crying, it begins to take over me. I am sorry for a long read, and thank you if you managed to go through all this text. I hope I made some sense out of it.

Tonsillitis is an inflammatory condition of tonsils and there is pretty much nothing after the conventional tonsillectomy. Nevertheless this is what it seems to look like. The case. My gf, 22, had been suffering from chronic tonsillitis since childhood. Lacune samples always showed presence of Streptococcus Aureus. Antiseptic treatment by a wide range of local antiseptics (including the Chlorophyllipt, and rather uncommon Brilliant Green) in best cases gave temporary relief, in most cases there was no effect.  A year ago she underwent Tonsillectomy without any complications, however the pain remained. Moreover, something similar to tonsillar lacunae started to form where the tonsils used to be (abscess?).  I'm no medic, but considering inefficiency of antiseptics, I strongly suspect an autoimmune reaction. To support this idea, she had Pityriasis rosea in anamnesis a couple of years earlier which had been symptomatically treated with local steroids. We had visited lots and lots of doctors. The case seems to be unconventional and nobody seems to care so this is my desperate attempt to request for fresh opinion on what should we do next.-	2016-11-16 20:37:29Z	Butterfly and Bones	1	0	tonsil-tonsillectomy, antiseptics

In this context, I ran into a question that I could not answer myself. As PD results in a degeneration of dopaminergic brain cell, it causes a deficit of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The symptoms that can be observed and that are typical for PD are mostly affecting the motor capabilities of a patient. My question is: How can one explain the tremor in the hands of a patient for example? I assumed that if there is a neurotransmitter missing, it would result in the affected body parts to become numb and immobile. However, for PD, the patient heavily struggles to perform voluntary movement, but involuntary movements seem to be present quite a lot.

A friend tells me that by the time you feel the first symptoms of a cold (runny nose, sore throat, whatever the first symptoms are), your immune system has actually already killed the virus, and the whole sequence of symptoms, from sore throat, to runny nose, to sneezing, to coughing, are just the body going through a kind of unnecessary routine, triggered by the virus, but not actually killing it since it's already been killed. This sounds unlikely to me, but is it true? (I do understand that it's not clear what it means for a virus to killed since it's not clear a virus is alive in the first place. I don't know if the claim is that the virus has been deactivated, or actually removed from the body, or what. But the gist is that the virus has basically been "dealt with" before you feel the symptoms.) (Also, I realize that even if the threat of the virus has already been removed, perhaps the sequence of symptoms is somehow a necessary part of the way the immune system works -- related, say, to how the body remembers the virus for the next time -- but still the question is whether the symptoms are not about actually ridding the body of the virus right now, since it's already been dealt with.)-	2016-11-19 04:42:49Z	Lucky	1	0	immune-system, symptoms, common-cold, virus
10046	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/10046/what-happens-if-a-regular-person-is-given-osteoporosis-medication-bisphosphonat	What happens if a regular person is given osteoporosis medication (Bisphosphonates)?	Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become weak and brittle, and lose mass/strength. So medication for osteoporosis increases bone mass and makes them stronger.  My question is: what happens if a regular person with perfectly fine bones is given osteoporosis medication (Bisphosphonates)? Is their bone density going to increase or is the body going to simply ignore it and pass it out? (Part of the below has been included into the question from the comments) Every adult person (normal or sick) has two ongoing processes in their bones - resorption (older bone tissue gets absorbed) and regeneration (new bone tissue gets created and added to bone structure).  Osteoporosis occurs when the rate of resorption is greater than the rate of regeneration - more bone being absorbed than is being created, thus leading to lower bone mass/density. This typically occurs in older patients whose bodies' regenerative capacity is starting to decrease.  Bisphosphonates (osteoporosis medication) are supposed to act by inhibiting the resorption of bone tissue. (If the mechanism is different, please do clarify in the comments or an answer.) Is there any reason this should happen only in a person with an already reduced rate of regeneration (something like the action of a catalyst which depends on the relative ratio of something and not on the absolute number)?.  Or, is the action of a bisphosphonate simply to reduce the rate of resorption (so that the new rate of resorption matches that of the naturally reduced rate of regeneration)?  In case it is the latter, is it not to be expected that the chemical will do the exact same thing (reduce the rate of resorption) in a normal person (whose bone regeneration rate is still the same) as well as a patient? Could this, in a healthy person, lead to the bones becoming more dense/massive than is normal?-	2017-04-14 18:18:35Z	Pills N Pillows	1	0	medications, osteoporosis, bone-density, catalyst

[closed]	Have scholars since determined Mozart's cause of death?  I know that there has been a swirl of mystery surrounding his death and for quite sometime poisoning by certain communities was blamed as the cause (as Mozart seemed to think so himself and even wrote his own requiem). But for the most part, those claims have been put to rest, correct?  The most likely diseases that contributed to his demise are rheumatic fever (which may have led to bloodletting), miliary fever, a strept infection and even being a hypochondriac (which caused him to consume medicines that contain antimony that are somewhat toxic), right? Which one of these is the most accurate or believed by the scholarly community -- according to the symptoms which were described (or any physical evidence -- has his body been exhumed to examine it)? -	2017-07-19 00:32:13Z	Butterfly and Bones	1	0	history, streptococcal-infection, blood-letting-leeches

Does it prevent postpartum depression?	From what I understand, consumption of the placenta (placentophagy) either via capsule or actual eating, has become more common (although I believe it is still a fringe practice). I know that other mammals have been doing this after giving birth, but is there any scientific evidence that it benefits a human mother? I have read both those that say there are benefits and those that say there is no benefits so I'm confused.  I read that the possible benefits are that the placenta is obviously chalkful of vitamins and hormones that will help the mother to heal both physically and emotionally after giving birth. For instance, it could help prevent postpartum-depression? It contains oxytocin, which helps promote lactation for breastfeeding? It contains prostaglandin, which helps the uterus to revert back as much as possible to its smaller state?  But then I read that there is no evidence that it does either of these, and it's possibly just a placebo effect. That the placenta only benefited the fetus while in the womb.  I'm not pregnant or anything, I would just like to better understand this trend, and know the science behind it. -	2017-07-18 23:15:32Z	Butterfly and Bones	1	0	fetus, placenta, postpartum-depression, oxytocin

Surprisingly, all professional doctors, school-textbooks and other resources, consider as armpit temperatures:  99  F (some-others   98.6 &deg F) = Fever;    99  F (Some-others   98.6 &deg F) = Normal;    99  F (Some-others    98.6 &deg F) = Less than normal.  But this doesn't match with my experience. I feel normal when I'm around 96 &deg F (officially which is less than normal); and 98.6  F is clearly perceptible as fever to me. (and this is   based upon a single thermometer on single event; it is based upon many).  Similarly; my mother tells 98.6  F is much more than a low-grade-fever whereas her normal temperature is around or below 96  F. On the opposite end we have seen peoples (such as my father when was youth) who did not reported any feverish or tired or such at near 100  F.  So it is quite surprising to me, that 99  F (or 98.6  F to some other doctors) is treated-as-definition of lower-end of    standard.   or it is just an 'average' or 'consensus' that doesn't cause serious deviation if used as an overall standard.  P.S. 1:  Wikipedia tells; normal temperature can vary slightly from person to person and by day of time. But I could not find any such mention about fever. P.S. 2: How the human normal temperature could be only one particular value?

In most cases, a tourniquet will be used on a limb that has arterial bleeding as opposed to venous. And in the case of arterial bleeding, the tourniquet will be applied proximal (above) to the injury. However, I began to wonder if one had to use a tourniquet to control a venous bleed where the tourniquet would be applied. Since venous blood is flowing back to the heart, couldn't the tourniquet be applied distal to the injury?   Theoretically, this is an injury in which   a vein has been injured but the bleeding cannot be stopped through traditional methods. -	2016-10-25 17:25:26Z	Pills N Pillows	1	0	blood-circulation, wound-care, emt, vein-venous, pressure

Usually a dentist would ask you if you're sensible to cold, hot, sweet or acid foods or drinks.

Which is worst or do they all mean the same ? Edit:  For any sensibility to happen the emanel must let the substance pass throught the dentin. What I belive is that: hot or cold change the temperature of dentin which in turn change the presure around the nerve, but doesn't necesarily need to touch it directly, acid and sweet (that became acid thanks to bacteria) get to the nerve by the pores of dentin, while air needs a direct road to the nerve, thus making it the worst sign.-	2016-10-26 11:04:28Z	Eiws Not	3	2	dentistry, oral-health, tooth-decay, acidic, teeth-sensitivity

I buy them from Costco.  Today I came across this page on Amazon on the same product.

I'm a very picky eater and don't even like seafood, so forget about anything exotic as eating worms! I got nauseous thinking about it and the fact that I've had these for several months now, and went and dissected a few of the figs but could not see anything like that.  Apparently they're fairly small and also hard to distinguish from the inner pulp of the fig. While reading the comments I saw some angry discussion between some commentators about it, some saying that this is the norm and most fruits naturally dried have things like that inside them and alternative would be using pesticide and ingesting chemicals.  That the US government allows some minimal level of things like that inside the food that we consume.  Of course the other side was saying that this is wrong and dangerous.

Cold slows down blood flow to an injury, thereby reducing pain and  . Cold therapy slows circulation. It should be used if the area is   or bruised. Compression stockings are used to help increase circulation. This helps swelling. How comes these two are true at the same time? I have reactive arthritis and my feet are swollen after long days especially when I stand up or walk a lot. I've read that poor blood circulation causes this and shifting between cold and hot water improves blood circulation. Normally I avoid hot water because it triggers my inflammation, it definitely makes it worse and cold is always good. Anyway, I tried it and I ended with ice compress after massaging in hot water. It didn't reduce swelling at all, it just made it worse. People also say that I should try compression socks for my swollen feet, but I am suspicious about it. If it increases the blood circulation it can't be good for me. Cold slows down the blood circulation and I know it is good for me.

Good evening again, everybody!  As my backstory goes, I am an insomniac (why you get so many questions from me).  I am so fatigued, but no matter what, I just can't fall asleep...  I've tried Melatonin -- the natural sleep hormone -- before, and it worked for a while, but it lost its effectiveness quite quickly. I started upping the dosages to get that "sleepiness" effect, and then stopped because I didn't wanna do anything dangerous.  But I wasn't sure -- is it possible to build a tolerance to melatonin (if it's natural)? Or was it not working because I was more stressed than usual?  What is the highest safest dosage an adult of 150 lbs should take?  Thanks.-	2016-10-19 03:06:01Z	Pills N Pillows	1	1	sleep-deprivation, sleep-aids, insomnia, drug-tolerance, melatonin

Adderall + Welbutrin / Bupropion	Current Medications: Adderall 20mg IR, Welbutrin (Bupropion) 100mg IR twice /day.  Symptoms: Over time I've developed an odd set of symptoms:  --My face always tingles / i feel compelled to "pull" my skin nervously.  If I take my Adderall I then notice this increases PLUS:  -- My eyelids get puffy (as in an allergy symptom). -- My throat feels tight.  -- I feel fatigued (as much as if I never took it).  -- Mind feels foggy Possible ideas:  -- I recently switched pharmacies and the brand of the adderall is different. So I switched to a different stimulant (ritalin) and noticed the same effects though slightly less so. However I have no history of an allergy to any of the inactive ingredients. -- As of about 3 months ago I increased my dosage of welbutrin to 200 per day. This was about the time my symptoms started to get worse.  Im curious if you all think this is more likely to be:  1. an actual allergy to the aderall (or inactive ingredient contained therein) OR if  2. the aderall is interacting with the welbutrin in an negative way producing these effects that seem to be allergic.

I was born a asthma sufferer. My asthma can be triggered by both sport and allergenes. I use a Ventolin inhaler (thus containing the active substance called " ") when the asthma becomes really uncomfortable. I have seen significant improvement in my comfort during endurance sport (such as running or cycling) when I use Ventolin before doing it (no matter if I feel ok or not regarding my asthma). It is a well-known doping product used by endurance athletes (including those who do actually not suffer from asthma), so that it made me wonder if the comfort improvement was due to the fact it not only "diminish my asthma" but also improve my performance as it would for someone healthy (not suffering from asthma). Suppose there exists someone who has the exact same body as I have, but without the asthma problem. Is it possible that this drug improve my performance in such a way it makes me significantly* better than such a person (who does not take the drug)? EDIT: even if the Wikipedia page says that there is "no compelling evidence that salbutamol [...] can increase performance in healthy athletes" (citing  ), I have often heard (but don't know if it is true) that many endurance athletes use salbutamol, so I really doubt it does not improve performance if they take it. Moreover, only one study does not seem enough to confirm a fact as most likely true (in a scientific perspective). So I am asking here for facts backed by different scientific sources. *significantly is vague and subjective, but can be understood as follows: a "significantly better performance of an athlete over another" consists in "this athlete completely outclassing the other one".-	2016-10-18 20:33:56Z	MoebiusCorzer	1	0	sports, asthma

I know that the deceased's relatives must give consent for an autopsy to be performed (if they do not already know the will of the deceased beforehand), but  Obviously, it's when a Jane/John doe's body is found, a murder/suspected murder has taken place, death is caused by an unknown reason, medical malpractice may be the culprit of the death, the body experienced traumatic exposure to the elements, scientific research conducted, a third-party (e.g. medications or faulty devices like parts of a car), may have contributed to the demise, etc. What are others? My friend and I were discussing and he thought that autopsies were performed on EVERYONE, unless the deceased's loved one's did not give permission, because the death certificate had to state the cause of death. But I think this is wrong; I know it's wrong. Because I know plenty of elderly people who have died in the hospital and did not undergo autopsies. The cause of death could be apparent; an autopsy is not necessarily needed to determine cause of death.   Because of the expenses surely tied to it?

I am one of the self-motivated activists who run some groups to answer various misconceptions about science and try to fight against ignorance, pseudo-sciences and blind faiths. I was recently asked by several participants about fasting as a "remedy" for infections. Many Ayurvedic practitioners make this claim and make vague reference to research on autophagy. Unfortunately, millions of people fall victim to such fallacious claims.  Here are some references about claims: 1."... Patients down with common fever are almost always advised to fast for one day, so that the body toxins get washed out for good; this opens up a healthy passage for the bed-ridden to be treated from fever as soon as possible." [Source:   2."When you are of the belief that you have been infected by amoebiasis or have an over growth of candidas stop consuming food and water until your prana starts flowing to pingala and your hunger is back in fiery shape." [Source:  These are just two examples. There are many such sites with millions of followers. Ayurveda is a recognized medical practice in India. But, I'm not convinced about such claims because research only shows that "intermittent" fasting boost autophagy which in turn improves immune system in general. Autophagy is a catabolic process where a cell "eats itself" and recycles the intracellular constituents. This also happens when cell naturally dies. Intermittent starving is only one of the ways autophagy gets induced and studies only show that autophagy induced by intermittent starving boosts immune system. Moreover, research also shows that some cancer cells also induce autophagy and rely on that for survival. In such cases, inhibition of autophagy is a actually a good strategy.  However, I don't think any of these imply "recovery" when you are already infected or when infection is well established. It's dangerously fallacious logic and it's like saying, "Your heart becomes healthy when you run regularly. So, start running when you have an heart attack". I simply want a valid reference that says fasting is actually beneficial even when one is already infected. To me there is a very good chance that opposite may be true. -	2017-03-09 10:52:10Z	Butterfly and Bones	5	1	immune-system, bacteria, virus, fasting

Bottom-line:    Growing up, I would always use a Q-tip to clean out the earwax buildup in my ears  . However, as research became more available as the years went by, audiologists and doctors alike have told me that Q-tips are not the best way to clean out your ears. In fact, they have the potential to cause further damage to your ears because you may just be jamming the earwax further down your ear canal, which can lead to infections/inflammations/loss of hearing, etc.  So the alternative method to cleaning out my ears with a Q-tip was to blow-dry them when I got out of the shower. I did this for a few years until the audiologists said that even though the blow-dryer doesn't sound too loud to me, I could be causing a lot of damage to my ear drums.  I don't recall what the alternative cleaning method has since been.   Yes, I am fully aware that a doctor can flush out the earwax, but I don't have the time nor the money to constantly be seeing the doctor since I have earwax everyday due to my hearing aids. I have a lot. -	2016-10-06 00:48:33Z	Butterfly and Bones	4	1	hygiene, audiology, hearing-aids, earwax, hearing-impaired

[closed]	~3 days ago, I was jumping on a trampoline. Being that I was jumping on a very good trampoline with a gymnast and a cousin or two of hers, I started endeavoring to do flips. After trying to successfully land a front flip 1-2 dozen times (I only succeeded once -- Hey, it was raining. :D), I decided to try to do a  . That, dear reader, is the crux of the problem. Inspired by my (almost) successes in the past, I jumped up, flipped 180 degrees, and landed on my head. Naturally it didn't feel too good, so I climbed out of the trampoline and took a break. I didn't really figure it would turn out all that bad. I kept turning it from side to side to keep it loosened up, but the next day it was worse than it was when I first landed on it. The day after my accident, you could feel where a vertebrate in my neck was out of alignment. Over the past couple of days, I've been treating my neck gingerly.

PSSD or Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction really worries me. This is when you carry on experiencing the sexual side effects of an SSRI for years after stopping taking the medication. If you take a single pill and then stop, you may feel a few side effects including sexual dysfunction, but I find it very unlikely that you will carry on experiencing this side effect for years to come, from one pill. I think the same applies if you take an SSRI daily for 3 weeks. You will likely experience the side effects for the 3 weeks, and then maybe for a couple of weeks afterwards, but I do not think that 3 weeks of medication is significant enough to leave you with sexual side effects for years or forever. The brain is very plastic and can heal remarkably well. But then you here stories about people who have taken SSRI's for months and then stopped, but then carried on experiencing sexual dysfunction for years or permanently. So where's the line?

Around the same time I started taking Dexedrine (about 4 years ago), I developed a quirk where I randomly blurt out words (such as names of my family members) or make little yelps for no reason whatsoever -- even when I was alone. I thought I was just an odd person. My family noticed it too when I visited them, and they playfully make fun of me.

[closed]	I have seen multiple doctors, including a neurologist, who are bewildered by my symptoms.  Upon altering the dose of lamotrigine from 400 mg to 375 mg, and then back up to 400 mg (split into two doses), I experienced violent myclonic jerks soon after administration of the medication, and noticed a numbness in my right palm, and a tremor I didn't previously have in my left. I also recall consuming alcohol and taking Valium that night. Shaken by the experience, I begun to taper off the lamotrigine under my doctor's guidance.  Over the following few days, the numbness that I initially noticed in my right palm spread throughout the right side of my body. Although originally localized to my right side, this numbness soon presented on my left palm, and spread until  my capacity to perceive pressure, temperature, pain etc. was noticeably reduced throughout my whole body (including head).   I also experienced frequent muscle twitches throughout the day, and continued to experience myclonic jerks following the administration of the night dose of the lamotrigine. Now, having tapered off the lamotrigine, my body continues to loose sensation. I experience occasional muscle twitches, and have a tremor in my left hand that I did not previously. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is a "normal" ability to perceive somatic-sensation, and 0 being none, I would be a 3.  Is there a label that encompases these symptoms? I have had an EEG, MRI, blood test (B12, etc.) and EMG. All of these tests have come back as normal. Where should I go from here?

When I was in Highschool, I was working 50+ hours, attending high school, and working on my Eagle scout project. I hit Energy drinks pretty hard. Between that and pizza I gained a pretty good amount of weight. Most of which I have now lost.  However, I am trying to study for an industry certification and I have a very hard time staying awake for more than 30 minutes or so if I sit down to study. I have found that I can sip my way through a monster, like I linked above, and it keeps me awake very well. Better than studying while standing or trying to do other exercises to keep awake (some of which just aren't an option because they make it too hard to read or I cannot type). The Monster does the job of keeping me awake fine and it's 0 points on my weightwatchers plan. I know that's not the best metric, as basically all diet/zero calorie sodas are  0 pts on it.  Long story short, if I am drinking 1 of these a day. 2 on the high side, which really isn't much more caffeine than several cups of coffee from what I have seen, is that going to be bad for me? And a good deal of people drink many cups of coffee a day. In an effort to fight any ill effects, I do drink 1 can over the course of about 6-8 hours and I drink at least a liter of water along with it. I find that sipping on both as I go helps me stretch it out.  Please note, I am open to comparisons and constructive feedback.

I would like to know what the name is for the medical condition, whose severity could be categorized by a vision dexterity test possibly related to overall body / hand to object reaction time after hearing a sound, whereby someone may have a low degree of awareness about objects in front of them / in their surroundings. This may be even when the person has perfect vision or does not but wears glasses. For instance, while in a car or other situation, someone could tell you "look at that (sign or object)", and you would be so slow locating it that it would pass by without you noticing. I think this condition may be related to either genetics, Down syndrome, or brain damage due to a car accident, or some other factor related to sound and vision processing speed, or brain sensitivity to motion, or both. I really don't know. I see this as a form of blindness (because it feels like a (vision loss) blindness, with a lower degree of non-assisted imagination).

For years I've tried exercising, eating healthy, etc. It works to some degree. I get plenty of sleep. I believe the issue is mental. For example, this morning I have a truck load of science experiments to build, but as I sat down to start building them I was swamped with horrible feelings, making it feel like I was carrying a mountain on my shoulders. At least one issue is that I get stressed due to fear of failure. I would much rather spend my entire day thinking. To leave my inner world of thought and actually do physical stuff feels like climbing a tall mountain. It's painful.  Is there anything I can do to numb such sensations? Sometimes I want to be a robot who feels no pain. Perhaps coffee is the answer. Or meditation. Or electric shock therapy lol. Or hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Or joggers high. Or some kind of psychological therapy or hypnosis. The reason I ask about becoming numb is that twice when life became incredibly horrible I suddenly had the most wonderful blissful sensation of numbness sweep over me. There are no words to describe how wonderful this numbness felt. It didn't last long, about 10 minutes, but during those 10 minutes I could do anything without pain /stress / sadness / fatigue / fear / feeling down. It would be great and more productive to be able to feel like that during my work hours.

On  , I eat melon a few days ago and I felt gassy during next 24 hours. Also, recently I was eating vegetable made from Raw Melon (it's know in my area, don't know about others) and I felt slightly more gassy. As my gastroenterologist doesn't know much and doesn't tell me much, I want to know the TIME after taking/eating them when we feel gas, just to make sure if Milk, and these fruits and vegetables are actually causing gas. Wherever I asked the question about lactose/fructose intolerance, they suggested me to check myself by eliminating foods. So that's what I'm doing these days. I see improvement but not much. Is it just after 1-2-3 hours of taking these products (this is related to my milk related issue)? If yes then how is it possible because things take at least 15-20 hours to reach large intestine? (I'm asking this because some sites say milk can cause gas after a few minutes of taking it!) Or is it actually when it reaches large intestine, undigested after 15-20 hours?

To read more about this procedure, you can read it here:    (Yes, that means I attended my senior yr of High School in a wheelchair). It was a painful process, but for about 6 years or so I was much better able to manage the pain that I had previously experienced on a daily basis.  Now, being only 10 years later at the  , X-rays show that arthritis has taken up residence in both of my ankles and  ; getting worse and worse. I have developed   to compensate for all the stress put on my deteriorating ankles. But I didn't need an X-ray to reveal that. My joints swell like balloons and hurt to the extent that you can almost hear the bones rubbing against the other bones.    When I was a bright-eyed 18 year old facing Triple Arthodesis there were vague warnings that sometime in the distant future (maybe when I was in my mid-fifties? Maybe older?) that I would have to address potential arthritis. And that I shouldn't expect to run marathons. None of that mattered to me -- that was too far in the future to concern me.

My OBGYN could not officially diagnosis me with endometriosis without performing a laparoscopy (a surgery), and he wants to avoid that at all cost, and he says, even if I had endometriosis,  the treatment would still be the same. So he is  going to treat me as if I have endometriosis. Looking at my medical history (all the pain/vomiting/nausea/PCOS, but yet having a clear Colonoscopy and Endoscopic Ultrasound and no food allergies) in addition to pressing on trigger points on my abdomen and inside cervix, he believes I have endometriosis. He believes that endometriosis may be contributing to my fatigue, extreme nausea, abdominal pain, migraines, digestive issues, etc. So to solve that he wants to insert an IUD into my uterus in two weeks. You can read about general IUDs  . Basically, it's a contraceptive that is inserted directly inside me. But it should help with all the symptoms associated with my period by getting rid of my period. It can last for up to 5 years. I can remove it (if I ever were to try and have kids). He thinks this is far superior to treating my pain than regular birth control.  The one he wants me on is called Mirena. You can read about it  . But it seems that a lot of the side-effects are the same as the symptoms that I'm trying to treat, so I'm wondering if it will be counter-productive. How common are the side effects of fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, etc? Also, by doing research, I've seen that this medication/device (Mirena) has been subject to many lawsuits, which naturally has me a little on edge. Have they improved this drug since the lawsuits? Is there anything I should be concerned about because of the lawsuits? -	2016-10-02 23:21:12Z	Butterfly and Bones	1	2	gynaecology, endometriosis, inter-uterine-device-iud, uterus, contraceptive

I understand the difference between STM and LTM (short/long term memory). However, remembering a fact is different than learning a skill. Example: Let's take a 99% mental-only skill like Software Engineering. You understand that IF this, THEN that, ELSE something-else. That's how you define a really basic piece of decision logic. There are many more complex forms of that which can become very abstract. At some point, you understand all of them (maybe even for dozens of languages) and you understand it so well, you subconsciously take a requirement and translate it into possibly hundreds of lines of code within seconds. This seems similar to the way people learn to read/write and speak multiple languages. Is this simply a function of LTM which translates bits of code into actions / results? If so, how does that LTM become more readily accessible than other areas of LTM where one has to think harder to remember something?

9142	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/9142/when-to-take-a-blood-test-after-a-gout-attack	When to take a blood test after a gout attack	Gout is caused by an elevated level of uric acid in the blood, which results in crystals forming in the joints. Once this reaches a critical level, the body responds by targeting the crystals, resulting in inflammation and severe pain. When there is suspicion that a patient has gout, he is typically sent for a blood test, to evaluate his blood level of uric acid. What I am wondering, is whether it matters how long after a gout attack this blood test is taken? As such, which of the following statements are true: 1) During a gout attack, the level of uric acid in the blood drops due to the body's response to remove the crystals. Therefore, the patient should have the blood test several weeks after the attack, to ensure the uric acid levels are back to their stable level. It doesn't matter what the patient eats during these weeks, because the uric acid level is dependent on long-term dietary habits, rather than the very recent diet. 2) Similar to 1), the patient needs to wait a few weeks before the blood test. However, the patient also needs to ensure that he eats according to his "standard" diet during this period, because uric acid levels are dependent on short-term dietary habits. For example, if the patient cuts down on foods causing the uric acid during this period (e.g. red meat and alcohol), then the level of uric acid during the test will not be a typical measurement. 3) The level of uric acid does not decrease dramatically after a gout attack, and the blood test can be taken soon after.

In movies, people who are shot or stabbed in the chest, especially  in or near the heart, generally lapse into unconsciousness and/or death instantly.

9069	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/9069/why-would-the-following-nutritional-scenario-lead-to-hunger-etc	Why would the following nutritional scenario lead to hunger etc?	Basically if someone had enough calories(but from mostly from carbohydrates and saturated fat only, with a little protein), why would they still feel hungry?  I know lacking adequate protein and fats can lead to health problems but my question is more about why the body would still by hungry despite this diet e.g. Does the body need an minimun amount of calories from protein? As an example.  Lets say someone needs 1500 callories to maintain body weight/energy. They live only on some chocolate biscuits.  The nutrition for the chocolate biscuit is as follows and they eat 16 buscuits per day: 1 biscuit/16 per day  calories 116 /(so*16)= 1856 calories per day.  saturated fat 6.0g /(so*16)= 48g fat per day.  Carbohydrate 14g/(so*16) = 224g  of which sugars 9g/(so*16) = 114g  protein  1.3g/(so *16) = 10.4 Note that the diet has no polyunsuturated fats or monosaturated fats.  As you can see it exceed the 1500 calories required, uses both carbohydrate and saturated fat and only has 10.4g protein. I know this diet would cause helth problems however that is not my question.  My questions is: Why would the body still be hungry despite well exceeding the calories required? Is it because the body needs a minimum amount of protein(more than 10.4g), the body needs a minimum amount of polyunstaturaed/monosaturated fats etc?  What is the reason?

My wife often has menstrual pains that knock her down for 1-2 days every month. She uses heat packs to make it bearable.  I saw an infrared light on special offer earlier today and considering buying it for her to see if it helps. Wondering if that helps. Vendors don't mention it specifically as a way to use it. Some sites suggest it's a way to use an infrared light. Other sights talking about menstrual pain specifically rarely seem to mention infrared light therapy as an option. So, I'm getting mixed signals.  Going slightly more fundamental, I believe menstrual pain is caused by cramps (uterine muscle contractions) and in some cases inflammation.

I'm a man in his 30s who has lived with mild spastic diplegia (cerebral palsy) all his life. Longevity runs in the family (all my grandparents have made it past 90 and one is working on 102). It recently occurred to me that I've never met an older person with CP, and I've started to wonder how this may or may not affect my life span. Googling for this information is flat-out terrifying, since the population averages include much more severe presentations of CP than my own, so lack of mobility and difficulties with self-care significantly confound lifetime outcomes. I'm fortunate to be on the very mild end of the spectrum: muscle tightness in both lower extremities but no other involvement. I am fully independent and do not need mobility aides of any kind. Currently participating in regular PT to (successfully) counteract some increased tightness of late. I realize this is a strange question to ask here, but there seems to be little information for people in my particular situation (perhaps an indication that I have nothing to worry about?).

Because all women suffer from their periods, and it's a pain for everyone so I don't want to appear like a hypochondriac if I approach my doctor about this (because I do have a lot of other conditions). While doing an ultrasound for something else, they did note that I had an anteverted uterus (but I don't think that's worrisome), but also that I had a 2.2 x 2 cm cyst on my right ovary. The report said it was benign, but that seems awfully large and could be causing me a lot of pain? Is that normal? And how do they know it's benign? Is this all PCOS stuff or is it endometriosis too? -	2016-09-15 22:16:30Z	Butterfly and Bones	2	1	pain, menstruation, endometriosis, pcos, ovarian-cysts

I understand that diet, habits and lifestyles differ preposterously across different countries and different people. Of late, there has been an increasing trend among people to take multi-vitamin tablets as a daily dietary supplement. Is there any actual benefit of taking it? Assuming that people normally eat a balanced vegetarian diet, I think the only justification for taking these could be that they aren't deriving all the essential nutrients from fruits and vegetables alone. Could the gradual degradation of environment over time be a reason for that? The answers so far suggest that the evidence in this direction gathered by most studies is inconclusive at best.

I need some concise resources (hopefully a book) to have a general study about brain. Anything from brain hormones to brain ability to learn and its weaknesses (like prejudice!)    : I share some basic understandings and fun facts about brain, so you can figure out what I'm searching for (It's verbose, So you can skip it!):  Recently US companies show a huge interest to corporate wellness programs. It simply means finding a way to get employees involved in physical activities. Setting some incentives like:  . It seems fine in the first glance, but I believe it's a mitigation, not a solution. It's like pushing a car instead of driving it!  This the point I introduce my own non-technical definition of a healthy brain:   A healthy mind doesn't need any incentive to do what is supposed to be right. If you know seating behind a table and staring to a screen for a long time is not supposed to be a good idea, simply stops doing it. A healthy mind is more a responsible source of decision making, rather than emotional one.  So what about emotions, love, etc. ? If you have played any music instrument, probably you are familiar with music scales. A single music is written in a specific scale. A talented composer selects a note or more out of the default scale. That's the same about life. You should have a normal and healthy lifestyle to fall in love, go for your emotions, etc. And you should know where and how you should select your excepted notes! Otherwise it'd be a chaos (and a healthy mind does not like a chaos)   In order to recommend a healthy mind we need a better understanding of brain (medically and psychologically).   is a hormone persuading the brain to experience some adventure and even fear. Alcohol makes your brain more emotional. Suppose someone has a crush to another one and either of them are married. Is it a good idea to take alcoholic drinks for a while!  In a Recently  I heard some news about brain learning capabilities. A normal human brain can learn up to 70 years old brain works like muscles. The more you put rational pressure, the more you learn. If you know all this facts about your brain, you won't waste your time watching stupid TV shows, just because you're 60 years old and you're retired! If you believe how much fun reading a book has, you'd put your time on studying instead.  In a nutshell, having an apprehension of brain, will help me create some meta models of healthy lifestyles, so I can help myself and some other people :)-	2016-08-17 16:08:33Z	HPM	1	0	mental-health, brain

That said, I've been looking for any evidence that states when is the appropriate time to stand or sit in the morning?  As in, after I first wake-up from my slumber would it be healthier on the body to start the day in a standing position?

So this happened: I steped on a bee and got stung on the underside of my large toe. During the day after the sting, my foot swelled and formed blisters on the upper side, near the sting. I opened the blisters and applied Octenisept (disinfectant) and Dermatol (poweder of talcum and Bismutum Subgallicum) to dry and protect the wound - this is a treatment I remember from my childhood for wounds like this. Since then I kept the area in the open as far as possible (figuring that it heals faster that way) and apply Dermatol occasionally. The fluid in the blister was clear, yellowish so I figure lymph fluid. No thick yellow fluid, affected foot isnt warmer than the other one and I'm generally fine. Else I'd have seen a doctor allready. With googling i found out that Dermatol may not be sold in Germany anymore (since 2003 actually) because there's no proof of any effect.

Thinking about refugees and the incredible problem of how to feed them, it occurred to me that vegetable oils are extremely calorie-dense, inexpensive and while relatively unpalatable, theoretically not a bad choice as a method of keeping people fed for a few days or weeks as we connect them with more long-term accommodations. Sunflower oil, for example, contains 1927 calories per cup, roughly the NIH recommended daily value, and most of those calories come from monounsaturated (good) fats. Most exciting is that sunflower oil can be bought in bulk for around $1.25 (US) per cup. Other oils are far cheaper even. That means you can feed refugees for less than $1.25/refugee/day, plus the cost of a multivitamin, using a non-perishable and very easy to distribute ration, and in theory keep them happy and healthy until better arrangements can be made. For longer-term rations, casein is fat-soluble, fairly complete in amino acid profile and can be purchased in bulk for around $2.75 (US) per 50g, the NIH recommended daily value of protein. This would more than triple the cost of the ration, but would make it capable of feeding people for far longer without adverse effects, theoretically. Plus, it could be dissolved in the oil for easy distribution. After some healthy (debatably) experimentation and research, it seems like an oil-only meal can be a somewhat uncomfortable experience. However, this can be largely ameliorated by splitting up the 1-cup meal into smaller amounts spread out over a few hours, similar to how most people snack throughout the day rather than eating 24 hours worth of food at once. Further, it would appear that most of the discomfort from this meal results from the way in which fats are digested, especially as it concerns the stomach. Basically, fats just sit in the stomach unaltered until they make their way to the duodenum, where bile salts emulsify and break up large fat globules. Yet the liver can only produce so much bile salts at a time, making this a rate-limiting step in digestion. For large amounts of fat (like a cup of oil), this can mean hours of the stomach's enteric nervous system being bothered by large amounts of fat waiting to move on. I think a decent solution to this could be to add emulsifiers simulating bile salts to the ration, allowing the natural churning of the stomach to far more quickly breakup and emulsify the fats, eliminating this rate limiting and thus speeding digestion and hopefully eliminating discomfort.-	2016-08-05 07:36:41Z	TheEnvironmentalist	2	0	nutrition, diet, digestion, calories

I've been coughing since about 3 weeks. I've some symptoms that might indicate a pertussis, including the "whooping" coughing (though not that distinctive), nausea when coughing badly, exhaustion. I might have been exposed to someone with pertussis. I had an immunization against pertussis, but this had been done more than 10 years ago. My physician heard breath sounds, which led him to send me to a Thorax CAT scanner (which showed no signs of lung inflammation). Additionally, he told me to wear a filter mask. He also prescribed me antibiotics (amoxicillin), though I'm unsure whether they show any effect. Although I asked for it, he didn't do a smear/blood test (for pertussis). I'm on a daily basis visiting a kindergarten (with a daycare center / pre-kindergarten in the same rooms and with the same entrance).

I'm attempting the "duct tape" treatment for a wart, which has worked well in the past with a verucca.    tape The treatment involves sticking some duct tape over the wart and leaving it for six days, then removing it and rubbing off the dead skin with a pumice stone or similar. The problem I have is that the wart is on my big toe, and it's proving really difficult to get the duct tape to stay on.  I got some extra adhesive waterproof duct tape, and I strap it on with water-resistant Elastoplast plasters, but it still seems to come loose quite quickly. What would be perfect, I think, is some strips I can put around the outside, like I'm doing with the elastoplasts, to hold the square of duct tape in place, that are really "hardcore" when it comes to sticking, and are also airproof so they don't let air in under the edges of the duct tape.  For the glue strength I was thinking of steri-strips, which I know have some kind of super strong glue that stays attached to the skin for 5-7 days.  But, I don't think steri-strips are airtight.

I did, and he was easily able to push my arm down. He told me my misaligned jaw meant that my muscles were off centre and therefore weak. He then moved my jaw until the top and bottom teeth were centered and made me bite onto a popsicle stick. Now he told me to put my arm out and when he tried to push it down he said he couldn't because i am much stronger now. He prescribed me a $2000 AUD pair of braces that i can put on and off, which will fix my TMJ. He said it could take a few months, he said it could take a few years, but it will eventually be cured. Back then i was still a kid living with my mum and I told her the TMJ joint disorder made my jaws lock when i opened my mouth and i couldn't eat so she ended up buying it for me. I wore it for about a week and it just felt like it was making things worse. so i stopped wearing it and after about 3 days it got better. 3 months after that i went to the dentist again who said i got much better. I didn't tell him that i stopped wearing it. The reason im bringing this up is because i saw the "put your arm out and resist me pushing your arm down" thing done by this energy stone seller on TV.

To the best of my knowledge and research, their advice has been generally very good and scientifically sound. There is one thing they keep suggesting I do to help boost my metabolism: eat numerous (snack every 2-3 hours) small meals a day rather than a traditional 3-meal breakfast, lunch and dinner. For a variety of reasons, this does not personally suit me, and quite frankly, the reasons I've been given as to why this happens don't seem to line up with what little research I have seen on the topic.

7534	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/7534/why-does-breathing-stop-during-cardiac-arrest	Why does breathing stop during cardiac arrest?	I've been reading about resuscitation, and found several suggestions that people don't continue breathing after effective heart function stops because the diaphragm quickly runs out of oxygen.  Is this correct? As best I can tell, current conventions are to continue to attempt resuscitation so long as brain stem cells are likely to stay alive, which, at normal body temperature, seems to be somewhere around 5 minutes after loss of pulse. But while the brain stem is alive, does the respiration center not continue to (try to) breathe?  If so, does the diaphragm really use all of its blood's reserve oxygen in just a few breaths, and simply not have energy to breathe?  If not, is there some other effect that impairs breathing when the heart is not pumping effectively?  I   it's the latter, since otherwise CPR would never include respiration, and effective CPR would be evidenced by the subject's breathing.-	2016-07-23 21:52:56Z	Lysander	3	2	cardiology, breathing, emergency, cpr

Based on my medical coverage, I actually have a choice of a few doctors, and each doctor is affiliated with particular hospitals, so when I choose the doctor, I will indirectly choose which hospitals the surgery will be performed at (in theory). Now, as surgeries go, and even surgeries related to vision, cataract surgery is probably an a fairly low level of complexity, and most any modern hospital that performs vision surgeries, would likely be equipped to handle such a surgery. But, I am more concerned about their ability to handle any complications that might arise during the surgery. By "how advanced a hospital is", I'm talking relative to the equipment the hospital has available, and the training and experience of the staff, for a specific surgical procedure, and the ability to handle any possible or likely complications related to that surgery. So, for a particular hospital (and even a particular doctor), how can I find out if they are suitable for the procedure? (I suppose it mostly relates to qualifications, reputation, and experience).

After talking to a physiotherapist I was advised that if physo goes well activities such as mountain biking could be done as early as 6 weeks as long as one does not fall. So,  6 weeks moderate exercises is fine, no risks to be taken.  6 months not 100% healed but can resume more risky activities. What would reasonable at 3,4 and 5 months.

I climbed Mt Fuji, 3500 meters, almost 3 nights ago. Most of the way I had a headache. While getting close to the top I had the crinkling noise when I would breathe, one might get at such altitudes. I descended soon after the crackling noise was noticeable enough. I was at a decent altitude being less than 1000 meters in less than 12 hours. The crackling noise disappeared quickly after I started my descent. After being at a normal altitude I seeked medical advice. He said my breathing didnt sound normal. I got an xray of my lungs and the doctor said I looked fine and only had a mild fever. Was given ant-inflammatory and antibiotics. The night after descending my head still felt a little heavy/funny, I had a low appetite, and would be out of breath while eating a lot of food.  Next day I felt almost completely normal until I was finally back at my home by myself at night. My head still felt a little funny and my breathing isnt a hundred percent normal. Woke up in the middle of the night and had a hard time getting back to sleep due to anxiety and abnormal breathing. Today I still dont feel a hundred percent with my head and breathing, but only a minor amount. My question is how long until mountain sickness completely goes away?

Two years ago, I engaged in a practice called erotic electro stimulation where men/and women use electricty (from TENS) to stimulate the genitals for pleasure (in order to induce orgasm).  From my understanding, TENS machine induces this effect by stimulating nerves and increasing blood flow. This practice is beeing used since many decades and every website I have visited (before engaging in that practice) said it was safe. I have done this for 2 years without any problems. I then took a drug called doxazosin (a drug prescribed for men who have enlarged prostate or who have high bloood presure).  My current issue is that I suffer from sexual dysfunction: my penis (the head of it) has lost its sensitivity and I have diminished orgasms (not pleasurable). Although I am aware that these symptoms can be associated with doxazosine, could these symptoms be linked to my use of TENS?

He should be the only other resident who's already there.  Having before lived in bedsits where problems multiply, I have schizophrenia and am now 48.  I have found that sometimes when people believe that someone isn't as strong mentally to be good around them, their behaviour worsens.  In my experience, they've gathered their friends around them, became difficult and ambiguous and have generally played up, behaving in ways that I can not see anything else but that something is wrong.  I'd be there, or talked about also, but particularly not spoken to.   I do not want to enter in to circumstances like this again.  Next month I will be 49 too, while still staying there.  My concern is, that if these issues start again whilst there, what should I do?  I have no yet knowledge or vision as to whether the housemate is a bookworm, or an addict, or how.  In the absences of no assurances that they might not play up and despite my confidences in myself, I am very reluctant to be in a same room as them. I will not simply move on.  I'm going there to stay for a brief period, just for 2 months.  I believe that approaching these ones that initiate the concerns in themselves, are completely unapproachable, to the means of withdrawing from any such situation because of what could occur.  These actions of others occur from people excluding the mentally ill, and not including.

7315	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/7315/are-generics-tested-for-side-effects	Are generics tested for side effects?	I have been reading about generics vs brand-name drugs.  I've learned that generics go through extensive testing for bioequivalence (both rate of absorption and total absorption of the active ingredient).  The statistical testing regime sounds pretty substantial to me, as far as testing of effectiveness goes. Are generic drugs tested to ensure their risk of side effects will be roughly equivalent?  Or, are there reasons to believe their side effects ought to be equivalent, in magnitude and likelihood?  I understand that generics may have different inactive ingredients.  Could this cause the risk of side effects to be materially different between versions of the same drug from two different manufacturers?  Or is that super-unlikely?  Should I discount/ignore concerns about the potential for variation in side effects between manufacturers? (I do understand that there is a small risk that a patient is allergic to one particular inactive ingredient that's one formulation but not in another, but for purposes of this question, let's ignore that.  Apart from that, could there be noticeable, reproducible differences?  Or is this unlikely?) (I have read  .  I know enough statistics to understand why claims that "generics can be up to 45% different in effectiveness" are highly misleading.  I've read about studies indicating that the average difference is more like 3% or so, and is probably similar to or smaller than the range of variation among different batches from the same manufacturer.  But those seem to be measured by absorption into the blood, and I'm not sure what that implies for the risk of side effects.)-	2017-04-13 12:53:20Z	Community	4	0	medications, side-effects

After watching the documentary  , I was inclined to look for trustworthy dietary advice online. Without getting into arguments about whether Fed Up makes a good argument about sugar consumption, one thing they did for sure was highlight the biases of some institutions like the USDA. Now I'm trying to find (relatively) unbiased information about food and nutrition. Some websites that seem popular: So, can anyone recommend websites which base their advice on peer-reviewed scientific literature, and which do not have ties with the food production industry? PS. I asked this question over at  , but it was deemed offtopic there. It was suggested I might ask here.

7177	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/7177/salt-and-bad-sleep	Salt and bad sleep	I've been having more and more problems with salt for a few years, especially late before I'm about to sleep. Eating out, beers at a pub with the associated salty nuts and food or a barbeque at home will render a night of bad sleep, nightmares and constipation the next day. Cutting down on salt is an obvious answer and I cook most meals from scratch with no or very little salt, bake my own bread (most recipes calls for 2 % salt, I find it salty enough at 0.5 %) but many ingredients come very salty as is, cheese and soy sauce to name a few which are too much work to make from scratch. Cooking myself usually solves the problem most of the time but eating out can't be avoided sometimes. I can reduce the problem by drinking plenty of water before going to bed, but I will wake up to pee in the middle of the night and the urine is very diluted so I assume I drank more water than needed to keep the salt balance (I've read 0.6 % blood salt concentration), but I can still very much feel the effect. Otherwise I'm slightly overweight but do cardio for 6-9 hours per week (cycling, skiing or running) so I'm definitely working on it and my stamina is better than most people my age, have no trouble sleeping and almost never constipated. I'm thinking about seeing a professional about this, but what should I ask? What should I check up before to make it meaningful? UPDATE: One and a half years since I posted this. Did see a physician who did take the time to do the blood work. Salt balance as in sodium to potassium balance was normal as was the overall salinity. He recommended me to keep eating less than 5 grams of salt per day. Still possible if I keep baking my own bread and cooking all meals from scratch.

Many people use   for sinus irrigation.  Using them can reportedly help with infections, allergies, headaches, congestion, and other sinus-related issues. Small packets of chemical mixtures are sold to be dissolved into distilled water for use within a neti pot. The most commonly sold packets often include "pharmaceutical grade" salt and aluminum free baking soda. Those packets quickly get expensive.  They also are wasteful, as you have to dispose of the non-recyclable packets in the trash after each use. A couple years ago, I researched making my own neti pot mixture.  Not surprisingly, my research turned up information that conflicted with other information. Everyone agreed that the solution should be primarily water.  But some people insisted it must be distilled water, whereas others said they just use tap water. Some people said just to add salt, others to just to use baking soda, others to use a mix.  Some said if it burns to add more salt (and they explained why it seems counter-intuitive but how it actually makes sense when you look at the chemistry involved).  Others said if it burns to add more baking soda.  Ugh. Another ingredient that was sometimes mentioned was hydrogen peroxide.  Some people recommended adding about 1-10 drops of hydrogen peroxide to a gallon of salt/baking soda mixture.  Some people said not to do that.

A recent test of a one of my friend's gave: I have found conflicting info about the reference ranges for the two antibodies, for example,    shows the reference ranges are 20 IU/mL and 35 IU/mL respectively.  Let me take THYROID PEROXIDASE ANTIBODIES to ask the question: if the same blood sample is sent to two labs the same day with different reference ranges, one is 35 IU/mL, one is 9 IU/mL. 35 is about 4 times of 9, can I say that the result value of the THYROID PEROXIDASE antibody in the lab with range 35 will be roughly 4 times of the result value at the lab of reference range 9? For example, the result value of the antibody at the lab of reference range 9 IU/mL turns out to be 19 IU/mL, then the same blood sample tested in the lab with range 35 should be roughly 4 times of 19, which is about 76 IU/mL? That way, the ratio of the result value to the reference range will be roughly 2 for both labs, i.e. 19/9, 76/35 are both roughly 2.  Or, I am completely wrong, the result value at the two labs should be roughly the same value, in the above mentioned example, both should be approximately 19 IU/mL? But then there is a problem for diagnosis, because one lab says it is within normal range, one says it is beyond normal range.-	2017-05-29 19:55:43Z	Kate Gregory	3	0	thyroid

[closed]	In her 2010 book GAPS Gut and Psychology Syndrome, Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride offers a very strong criticism of the health impacts of vegetarianism (and to an even greater degree, veganism, hereafter implied). Highlights include the claims that: She references the book,   by Lierre Keith.  She also goes on later in the book to list additional health concerns resulting from vegetarianism.  Needless to say, this contention is extremely controversial.  Many people still believe that vegetarianism, and even veganism, are healthy lifestyle choices if executed properly. My question is, what does the highest level science have to say about vegetarianism/veganism?  Presumably individual studies have shown conflicting results, offering firepower for people on both sides of the debate.  Have there been any systemic reviews/meta-analyses outlining a high level picture of what we know about this subject from a scientific perspective, which would be more credible than a single study?

In order to be able to care for them better. Im working on a open source project to provide remote monitoring of senior population.  The idea is to detect anomalies in behaviour and generate alerts if needed. This is an implementation of the latest buzz word IoT [Internet of things]. Basically Im using AWS IoT platform, and a combination of arduinos and raspberry pis for sensors boxes. The data collected is analysed searching for patterns and anomalies, That after anonymization can be shared for data science and research purposes. So basically a bunch of wireless sensors can be used to measure different things like: . movement . temperature, humidity, barometric pressure . Gas, air quality . object temperature [like a stove/heater] So one example is that after the system learns what is the normal time a person goes in and out of bed, it can detect an abnormal time staying in bed, and alert if necessary. What things would be useful to measure in the aged care environment?  What insights about routines/behaviour are valuable for a carer, doctor/nurse, family member?

But my understanding is that the only "machine" indicated for restarting a heart that has completely stopped (i.e., "flat-lined") is manual compression.  I.e., even if you're a patient in a Level 1 trauma center, if you flat-line then all the machines get pushed aside and one person is going to start pushing on your chest above your heart to try to get it started.  (And you might get a does of epinephrine.  Oh, and if you're really "lucky" and they have your chest torn open then they'll reach in and compress the heart directly.)  Is this accurate? If so, isn't this weird?  Pushing on the heart through the rib cage to get it to spontaneously start seems like trying to rescue someone drowning by standing on the shore and poking them with a stick. We can electrically stimulate every muscle to contract.  I understand that a functional heartbeat requires a   series of contractions.  An electrocardiogram can   the sequence of contractions in a functional heartbeat.  Why can't it (or something like it) pump current back through its electrodes to   a perfect heartbeat? Or, if one could place arbitrary electrodes directly on a heart, could an electronic device force it to beat  indefinitely  when it has flat-lined?  Or is there some reason that is not technically or medically feasible? Again, it just seems weird that when the heart stops the current best practice is basically to just try "nudging" it to start.-p3035goa	2017-04-13 12:53:20Z	Community	2	1	cardiology, medical-device, emergency, cpr

5874	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5874/can-manual-external-defibrillators-restart-a-heart	Can Manual External Defibrillators “restart” a heart?	On TV it appears that every time a heartbeat monitor flat-lines they pull out the paddles of a manual external defibrillator (MED) and give a few shocks, often explicitly cranking up the output when an initial charge doesn't restore a heartbeat. My technical understanding of this is that a MED is   indicated when the cause of the heart "stopping" is some form of fibrillation or arrhythmia.  Granted, maybe "off-screen" is an electrocardiograph the EMT is referencing.  But if not, would an EMT ever use a MED if the only thing he knew was that a person had no pulse? Or, is it the case that a heart will   stop due to either fibrillation or arrhythmias that a MED can reverse? What if a subject   have a steady heartbeat: Can a MED   a beating heart? I suppose that if a subject has no pulse one might argue that the MED can't  .  But is a MED a substitute for CPR?  E.g., if you had a MED and   on the patient would you apply both MED shocks   CPR, or what is the current best practice? Back to TV depictions: They almost always show the subject of MED arching his back for roughly a full second when the charge is applied.  I've never seen a real MED application, but my understanding is the pulse is only supposed to last 12ms.  Also, since it is applied across the chest, the skeletal muscles most prone to contract would presumably be the chest and upper abdominals, which would (if anything) cause the exact opposite contraction, and only for an instant.-	2016-05-27 15:06:30Z	Lysander	3	1	cardiology, medical-device, emergency

Melatonin, a hormone, is sold over-the-counter in the US and Canada. Clinical psychologist Michael Breus  : An endocrinologist named Richard Wurtman  : Imagine this scenario:  Once a month or so, a healthy young adult wakes up after five hours of sleep and has trouble falling back asleep.  When this happens, he finds that taking a small dose (between 0.5 mg and 1 mg) of immediate-release melatonin seems to usually help him to fall back asleep an hour later. Fine; he finds it helpful.  But is it safe?  Dr. Breus says melatonin should be taken before bedtime.  And Dr. Wurtman seems to have studied the use of the tablets close to bedtime  not in the middle of the night.  [Edit:  Hormones are powerful substances which may have short-term or long-term side effects which we're unaware of.  Dr. Breus seems to be implying that melatonin can be used for delayed sleep phase disorder but should not be used for ordinary insomnia.  I wonder whether or not it is truly safe to swallow hormones to help deal with these awakenings.] (I added this postscript to my question on May 19.)

5830	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5830/overcome-emotions-when-talking-to-people	Overcome emotions when talking to people	I need something to calm myself down when interacting with certain people(crushes included here).  Sometimes I'm so calm, and I could say whatever I want, but most of the time,  there's a wave of emotions hitting my chest and neck. Possibly also some blood pressure increase in the brain, if I recall correctly. I can't hold my smile anymore, I can't control my face muscles easily, words won't flow as easy as before, even walking becomes a bit irregular, as I start to feel my legs less in control, and so on. This destroys my confidence, and makes me more introvert, wanting to avoid such situations from happening again, so less social interactions.  I know the theory, that all of this has deep roots in brain's memories from the past, moments that you, as a person, felt awkward while interacting with others, etc; and in order to overcome it, think positive and try to remember more "glorious" moments, while interacting with others, so that your brain will somehow forget and "un-wire" those memories. I need to understand why is this happening, what happens in the brain, what supplements/pills could I try in order to reduce it, etc. I'm approaching 30's, and it's kind of late to think that this can be solved naturally, just by interacting more, until I'd become "numb" to these emotions.  I've lived almost half of my life already.  Why I don't think that a psychologist could help me? I don't know, I'd see myself there being a bit nervous for the first sessions, then after a while, I get used to the person, and the emotions disappear.  But then, if there's someone new, or someone new that I'd like a lot, I'd be back to square zero, filled with those pesky emotions inside my brain, chest, neck, legs, etc.-	2016-05-16 19:04:18Z	Alex	7	1	mental-health, treatment, anxiety-disorders
5826	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5826/whats-caused-by-the-chemicals-and-whats-caused-by-the-smoke	What's caused by the chemicals, and what's caused by the smoke	The great many downsides of smoking are certainly well-documented by now (to say the least), but something I've struggled to find an answer to is the following: When looking at health risks of smoking, what's caused by the substance in question being absorbed and interacting negatively with the body, and what's caused simply by the act of inhaling smoke? My assumption would be that most of the damage is caused by the inhalation of the smoke itself, especially any damage to the mouth, oesophagus, and lungs, smoke (any kind) simply being dangerously irritating to these parts of the body. Then, damage to the brain and/or other parts of the body are mostly caused by the specific substance being smoked... How much of this assumption is correct? Perhaps it's misleading to try and separate the smoke from what's causing the smoke at all, as what's creating the smoke dictates how bad it is. However, if that's the case, doesn't that imply that some products for smoking, while still bad, may create smoke which is "less damaging" than others? For ease of answering, feel free to just concentrate on tobacco products (possibly including any additional chemicals added to the final product) if you feel it's necessary to keep your answer from not being too long.-	2016-05-16 04:08:36Z	Susan	6	2	smoking, lungs, toxicology

5814	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5814/is-drinking-salt-water-to-induce-vomiting-safe	Is drinking salt water to induce vomiting safe?	A couple of years ago I was on an expedition in Honduras, and was one of many in our team who succumbed to an unknown water borne infection that caused repetitive vomiting and other unpleasant symptoms. The effects began to manifest themselves at around 11pm at night. I was the second of 14 total sufferers to notice that I was feeling nauseous, and after seeing the first person vomiting I knew I would inevitably follow in their footsteps at some point in the night. While putting on my head-torch and helping the first victim with (sterilised) water and physical support I began to join the dots between what I was seeing and the numerous people in the group who had retired to their tents early that night - I realised then that things were likely only just getting started. Within the hour another 2 people succumbed to the same symptoms, myself and another team member assisted where we could and I continued to feel worse by the minute. After seeing the states my colleagues were in I decided to do something to try to help myself before I became the next person. I filled my canteen with clean water and proceeded to empty a full bag of salted peanuts into it to create the most concentrated salt water I could in the circumstances, found a secluded spot and drank the lot. My body's reaction was rather rapid and unpleasant, but as intended it had cleared by system of everything I had consumed that day. As a result, although I still felt rough I was much better able to help those whose infection had had a greater time period to take hold and produce more extreme symptoms. I didn't sleep until about 4am. Ever since this experience I have vowed that next time I experience considerable nausea I would induce vomiting to clear my digestive system of whatever is causing the nausea before the (assuming pathogenic) cause has time to multiply further - thus reducing the duration of suffering.-	2016-05-14 17:31:47Z	Sam3000	1	0	water, infectious-diseases, salt

I am in the process of building a device that will track eye movement via a camera. To light the eye I am using an array of infrared LED's and my camera is sensitive to IR light. After using the device for several hours today (testing and the like) I have noticed a slight headache similar to eye strain but only in the eye that I have been testing with. My quesion is as my eye is constantly having a bright IR light shone in it, but I can't percieve it as it outside of my visual spectrum, are there still parts of my eye that are sensitive to this kind of light and might be strained/damaged by this? It could very well just be a normal eyestrain headache (as I am sat at a computing while doing this work) but I would rather be armed with more information before I continue this work (as this product might be tested on people other than myself) Thanks!-	2016-05-11 14:05:25Z	Aphire	6	0	eye, headache

I have had this lingering suspicion that maybe my sleep issues might have something to do with digestion but only recently confirmed it by keeping a sleep log. Every day I couldn't sleep, I ended up having a bowel movement within 2 hours. I guess there's some kind of nerve in the intestines that tells the body to wake up when it nears the exit. I tried eating more fiber but it kind of exacerbated the problem because it increases the frequency of bowel movements, making it more likely that I'll wake up before I've had enough sleep. (Unless I'm doing it wrong? I eat a big bowl of lentils in the morning) What can I do to make sure that my bowel movements are well into the afternoon and not during the nighttime or morning?-	2017-04-14 10:00:35Z	Pills N Pillows	3	1	gastroenterology, waking-up, defecate-poop, large-intestines, small-intenstines

If I rotate my head to the right, however, long before the bridge of the nose point, I lose binocular vision and get double images. I can see from shutting eyes etc. that the problem is that the right eye is over-compensating for the head rotation and going too far in the opposite direction (whereas the left eye is still perfectly on-target). Hence the double images. Alternatively: If I'm looking elsewhere and I suddenly move my focus onto the problematic area of vision by shifting my eyes to something far left, I get the same problem: eye on right side ends up looking too far left, left eye in bang on target.

I suppose it wasn't the right time, but in a few years I became addicted to workout and did it without a properly warm up or a schedule. At the age of 16 I was benchpressing up to 100 kilograms and I experienced lower back pains as a big claw would squash my body starting from the backbone. Then I shifted to smaller weights and started kickboxing. At a training session I felt my upper back damaged, but continued lifting some small dumbbells to warm up for a fight. After the ground fight I went home and next morning I felt the upper back almost immobile, with an excruciating pain at every movement. Since then I gave up all the sports, but I still feel the lower back and sometimes the upper back pains for a few minutes (in the same manner, crushing me) when I lay down on the bed. Also I experience minor heart pains, but this may be because I became sedentary and studying 12 hours a day with irregular and unhealthy meals made me accumulate some fat (80-90 kilos and somewhere at 1.60-1.70 meters height, but much of weight is muscular as I still have strength and the fat is just a small layer). Sometimes the pain radiates to the testicles and kidneys as well, but in other situations the kidney stones do the same thing and I am not sure about the source of the pain.

We're now about 3 weeks into another reintroduction, which is going much better (YAY!). Mom's had primarily baked goods and cheese (not much, a slice or two on a sandwich every couple days). So it's obviously not causing issues like before. I'm of the opinion that it's a fairly binary problem - either the milk proteins cause problems or they don't. Mom thinks it's more quantity-related, like mild lactose intolerance, where if our daughter gets too many milk proteins it will bother her. Is there any research to back either one of us up?-	2016-05-03 02:43:01Z	Drew	4	0	digestion, infant, dairy

5596	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5596/any-sort-of-help-to-increase-height	Any sort of help to increase height? [duplicate]	I'm a 20 years old male, 5.5 Feet tall. My father is 5.6 feet tall, my mother is 5.2 feet. I'm suffering and I'm very much unsatisfied with my height. I'd give anything to accomplish my goal which is to gain a few extra inches. I'm not expecting an unrealistic result, just a little improvement. (1 or 2 inches would seriously make me the happiest man on earth). Through my entire life I've been the short guy. It hasn't effected me and I've almost never let it out, but deep down, I'd give anything I possess just to be of normal height, go out with my friends and feel equal, and not inferior or "defected" as I feel now. I feel (and know) that my height is effecting me at many aspects of my life. It makes me insecure in normal daily situations, even when I walk beside someone who is taller than me by more than a few inches.  When I was 14 years old I already cared a lot about my height and convinced my mother to visit a doctor. We took an x-ray of my hand bones. According to this, the doctor said I will probably hit 5.7 feet. I was depressed, but as of now, I would be so glad to get there. I've tried hanging from bar exercises when I was 18, yet saw absolutely no results, so I quit it after 2 months I'm living a very healthy lifestyle. I am 148 pounds, been doing sports my entire life. I've started swimming daily about a month ago, hoping that this would somehow help my height, and so far it has only made me leaner and toned my muscles (which is great) but not my main goal. I'm taking Vitamin D and Soft iron every morning with a glass of fresh lemon. I eat healthy carbs and low fat meat. I take Magnesium before sleep and Moringa super food supplement.  The one thing I'm worried about which could have messed my height growth is my sleep. Since I'm so into growing and yearn for it, it has got to me in my sleep. I've not been sleeping so well since I was 15 years old. I've had times in which I suffered difficulties to fall asleep, sometimes I used to wake up in the middle of the night. In general, when tested my sleep in a sleeping lab, it was turned out that I was dreaming too much during my sleep. My most family members are also not tall (most men are 5.6-5.7 feet), except my grandfather (from my father's side) which was 5.7 until 20, and grew to 6 feet. Since I've heard most men can grow until they are 21, I still have hope, I still want to accomplish my goal, I still want those few centimeters that will make me so unbelievably happy.  Is there anything for me to do? Injecting growth hormone at 20 could still help? I regret not doing this before, and if it could still be helpful I might because I don't care about the side effects, I just want to grow so bad.  I will definitely keep up with my swimming, because I enjoy it and it helps my body, but can it help my height?  Please give me any tip or advise, something that will give me hope. Is there any workout routine online that has been proved successful? Is there any product online worth buying?  Thanks for your time-	2016-04-23 16:24:30Z	S. Peter	0	0	nutrition, sleep, height

5589	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5589/what-happens-when-a-person-gets-the-wind-knocked-out-of-them	What happens when a person gets the wind knocked out of them?	I asked   (making a pronounced, sharp huffing or hissing sound).  Some of the answers say that one of the reasons for the exhalation is the expectation of being counterpunched, possibly to the body, which makes it desirably to preemptively empty the lungs to reduce the effects of having your wind knocked out. This simultaneously makes sense and confuses me.   If you've had the wind knocked out of you (as I have, more than once), you know that it isn't simply a matter of the lungs being emptied - if that were the case, you could simply take another breath and replace the missing air without any fuss.  Instead, having the wind knocked out of you makes it utterly impossible to breathe in for a fairly long time - in my experience, you start to take in a little bit of air after about 30 seconds, and can breathe somewhat normally after a minute or so.   The reason having your wind knocked out is so panicky and terrifying is because your body seems to turn traitor and refuse to partake in the fresh air surrounding you, and which you so desperately need.  It doesn't seem to be a matter of the lungs merely emptying;  it feels like the diaphragm itself has stopped working. What is happening here?  Have the lungs merely emptied?  Is the diaphragm convulsing or temporarily paralyzed?  Is it something else entirely, or a combination of some/all of the above, and/or other factors?  And finally, does it really make a difference whether the lungs are full when the impact occurs?-	2017-04-13 12:49:44Z	Community	4	1	lungs, injury, breathing, sports

Still, radiation levels were serious and many people in these cities contracted illnesses and, in many instances, died.

5533	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5533/elevated-glucose-right-after-waking-up	Elevated glucose right after waking up	After a recent blood test that showed elevated fasting glucose (110mg/dl) and elevated triglycerides (~335mg/Dl), I got myself an Accu-check glucose tester and started regular testing to try to figure out where I'm at in terms of insulin resistance etc. Several times now I've had a set of results I don't understand. Today for example, I tested my glucose level right after waking up and I got 106mg/dL.  Feeling this was a bit high (my average over the last 7 days is 100) I drank a bit of water (as I hadn't drank any overnight) and re-tested 20mins later. The second test result was 96mg/dL. Same thing happened three days ago with 108 and 109 after testing twice immediately after waking up, then 97mg/dL 25 mins later (again after having a bit of water as I hadn't drank any during the night). Which of these results is more relevant/accurate. Is the first one skewed by slight dehydration, or is the second one less relevant because of either the water or the ~20 mins of activity? For context, I suspect that the elevated glucose and triglycerides stem from both my sedentary lifestyle and daily alcohol use. My diet on the other hand has been quite good and I've generally avoided sugars and high GI carb for almost 10 years now. For the last 10 days I've stopped drinking and am in the gym almost everyday alternating between weight training and ~30 mins on a stationary bike. Edit 1: As Graham Chiu pointed out, water intake in the morning should not skew my results. Although, I'm unclear whether not drinking enough water on a given night could increase the result the following morning? The other question is, can there be a ~10+% drop in blood glucose after 20-25 minutes of light activity in the morning? Or should I be chalking this up to coincidence and meter error margins (even though back-to-back results are quite consistent)?-	2017-04-14 05:50:00Z	Pills N Pillows	1	0	diabetes, fasting, glucose, waking-up

He has about 70 years old. He doesn't present any signs of dementia. I assumed halucinations started because of the higher level of urea. Anti-pshichotic didn't worked on him. Without dialys theraphy, he'd probably die in a few days. I'm really interested in this case and curious about the treatment. Isn't something left to do?

Might sound like a weird question, so here's a bit of context: The story I'm writing is quite fantasy-driven (i.e. characters can seemingly "create" elements like thunder and water out of thin air). However, despite these fantasy elements, a lot of realistic moments occur which are often based in human unpredictability, so it's not like characters don't fear anything because they possess special powers or whatnot. Parts can easily turn into a killing/slaughter scenario   "A Song of Ice and Fire", or even "Attack on Titan". In a certain scene, an entire village was put up in flames. Amidst the confusion created by this, a man saves another fellow man from a house that is completely alit in flames. Upon his rescue, the half-burnt man asks his hero to save his daughter who's still in the house, to which he replies with the question: How old is your daughter?. The other man is baffled by this response, not understanding where he's coming from, to which he backs up with If your daughter is around 4 years old, there's nothing I can do. My explanation is that this character is not risking his life if he knows the person-to-save would most likely die even after being rescued when other (possibly more important) lives are concurrently in danger. So my question is this: If a house is on fire, are young children more prone to faint since they have a more underdeveloped body system than adults,  , due to their size, can they stay safe from smoke and large fires by sticking themselves into corners until their rescue arrives?-vx8cnf597hdfa	2016-11-11 14:13:50Z	Butterfly and Bones	0	0	age, fire-safety, smoke-inhalation, unconsciousness, carbon-monoxide-poisoning

However, I notice that all the staring at screens takes a toll on my energy during the day and I want to protect my eyes.  I have already altered the brightness/contrast and colour of my monitor.

Edits more than welcome) I'm not really interested in the tinted version since I covered that with adjusting the settings of my monitor. My interest is in glasses with a low correction that cancels out or reduce staring.

I don't eat as healthy as I should primarily because of the work involved (expense isn't helpful).  I'm a busy young professional and by the time I get home from work, I just don't want to cook.  It's super convenient to pour my dinner from a pitcher that took me 5 minutes or less to prepare the night before and I feel good knowing that I'm getting proper balanced nutrition. But I just can't do the liquid diet all the time.  It was driving me crazy and I've reverted (mostly) to my old (unhealthy) ways.  It's not that I don't like the taste or anything.  It's actually pretty good after a few days' acclimation.  It's just boring eating (read: "drinking") the same thing all day every day and the lack of solid food seems to present a psychological barrier I wasn't expecting. While munching on a delicious chicken dish, much like a casserole, that was made for me for my birthday recently, I began to wonder if there was a recipe for some sort of crockpot meal that might offer similar benefits, e.g. total balanced nutrition in a simple-and-inexpensive package.  Something I could dump in the crockpot and come home to perfect food in the evening with little to no effort.  Maybe even make up several days' worth in advance. Unfortunately, my Googling has turned up nothing but "dieting" recipes.  "Less than 299 calories per serving!" etc.  I'm not interested in "dieting" per se.

5287	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5287/how-consistently-does-alcohol-affect-reaction-times	How Consistently Does Alcohol Affect Reaction Times?	I've always been told that alcohol will reduce reaction times.  There are lots of sources for this online.  For example: And countless others.  It seems pretty solid.   However, anecdotally, I've noticed a trend where my performance in activities that benefit from a low reaction time improve after I've had a few drinks (namely online FPS games).  I decided to investigate further and setup a small experiment.   Every 20 minutes I would record my BAC level using a breathalyzer, take an online reaction time test ( ) five times, and consume 1oz of 80 proof alcohol. For reference, I also consulted an online chart estimating BAC levels (  - I'm male and ~160 pounds) The results I saw are completely contradictory to everything I've ever been told.  Over the span of three hours, my reaction time   increase.  In fact, it decreased!  Each point in the chart below is 20 minutes apart - and the estimated BAC level from the website.  And the test consisted of 10 measurements (and I dropped the 2 lowest, 2 highest and averaged the remaining).

You may have heard about the Folding at Home program.  They study protein folding by successively calculating how a protein proceeds to be manipulated according to scientific principles.  The calculation is done step-by-step, or in serial.  Contrasted to this is more "parallel" calculations, in which many combinations are analyzed at the same time.  For instance, we could inquire as to which compound(s) bind to a particular protein.  There may be a million or more different combinations that can occur.  If we more compounds are added to this this compound, there may be a million new combinations that bond to each and every of the previous million combinations, for a total of a million times a million combinations.  If we continue adding to this structure, we will have a million * a million * a million * etc... I was wondering if anyone has fit some medical questions into this type of "parallel" computation.  My motivation comes from studying this type of calculation from a computing standpoint, and I wonder what types of problems might fit into this framework.  I'm really hoping that there will be many medical problems that fit this type of "parallelism", but I don't know medicine/biology very well.  Any help, such as ideas, papers, or even people that I could talk with about this would be greatly appreciated.  I am really just looking for someone to point me in the right direction.

Between the upper and lower "healthy" limits is a rather large range of weights. Anecdotally, when I am at a BMI of 25 I still look and feel rather overweight (flabby, bulging belly, etc.). I've only ever been as low as around 21 or 22 BMI, at which point I am rather slim, and at the weight I'd need to be to achieve 18.5 I imagine I would be very skinny, too slender by my personal standards. Is it really the case that someone at a BMI of 18.5 would be equally as healthy as someone at 21.75 (the midpoint) or 25? By healthy I mean equivalent risk of long term illnesses, early death, etc. (assuming other health-related factors to be the same). If not, then is there a more accurate way to determine an optimally healthy weight (as opposed to merely a range of healthy weights)?

I eat protein bars regularly. The ones I typically eat are called Pure Protein or Balance bars.

My question is not really whether or not processed foods are healthy to eat (Natural > Processed > not eating), but rather if the human body utilizes the protein and vitamins contained in them. Will 20 grams of protein from a protein bar have the same effect as 20 grams of protein from organic grilled chicken? Are the vitamins they contain (which I assume are similar to taking a multivitamin) effect the body in the same way as if I ate nothing but organic fruits and vegetables?

I have noticed a very strange, but positive, side effect of taking melatonin supplements or cherries high in melatonin (I have blood tests which confirmed food allergies, and apparently my absorption of melatonin is blocked, in part for this reason). When I am deficient, I don't like to open the blinds, but I actually consistently actually crave sunlight in the morning when I have sufficient melatonin (and I feel less anxiety (unless taken in too high of an amount, in which case I feel depressed), I better experience and remember dreams, and I am actually able to engage in prayer, which is something that has been hard for me to muster the energy for while deficient, despite having enjoyed the activity previously). Are these effects, in particular sunlight craving, recognized phenomena? Is anyone familiar with a mechanism by which melatonin would do this?

A couple of years ago I saw a   television documentary about sugar and fat. One section mentioned three experiments performed by Dr Paul Kenny in which rats were given their ordinary rat food plus and unlimited supply of: Experiment A. Unlimited sugar Experiment B. Unlimited fat Experiment C. Unlimited sugar and fat mixed together (50:50) The stated results were that in experiment A the rats did not put on any weight, in experiment B the rats put on weight but not much and in experiment C they put on loads of weight and would eat the 50:50 mixture to the exclusion of their ordinary food. I also remember the documentary said the 50:50 ratio was critical and if the ratio was shifted too far in either direction then the weight gain effect reduced sharply. It was postulated that the reason for the satiety error was that sugar and fat don't often occur together in nature so the rats (and maybe people too) haven't evolved the biochemical feedback mechanisms for determining when they are satiated from such a mixture. Edit: (Dr Kenny's work seems to be related to  ) My question is this: have there been any follow-up experiments from this work?

5046	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5046/does-pain-lower-resistance-to-addiction	Does pain lower resistance to addiction?	For a little background, I'm known by everyone in my circle of family/friends for being the most healthy.  I eat far less than most people do and it's usually fresh vegetables and things like chicken white meat and eggs for protein.  I wasn't always this way, and I was a chow hound in my youth.  I was quite large, too.  Looking back at this, I believe that I have a degree of food addiction.  Resisting sugar is an everyday struggle for me, and I have gone through periods where I don't resist it very much.  But usually I stick to generally healthful food for months at a time. Recently, I slept in an improper position that caused me to wake up with severe pain in my neck.  In the grand scheme of things, it really hasn't been that bad, but it was still causing sudden sharp pain throughout the day. I noticed that my resistance to eating things that are considered junk food was much lower.  During moments of pain, I kept having the urge to eat something of large portion that I normally wouldn't have often like hawaiian bbq, burgers, ice cream, etc.  I resisted for hours until I caved in and got a teriyaki bowl(I paid for a large with extra meat and sauce) and a Coke. This isn't normal behavior for me.  Sure, resisting temptation is a struggle every day for me, but I also rarely give in just that easily.  The whole experience reminded me of one of my friends who deals with chronic pain, and usually she indulges in things like ice cream when she's having a flare-up.  She usually tries to eat right but her condition often throws her off the wagon. Is there something about pain signals that cause the brain to lower its resistance to addiction?  I anticipate some people might think that the answer "yes" is common sense, and I think it would be if the pain was caused from withdrawal; the pain I described in both cases is not withdrawal and resistance to addiction was sufficient for long periods of time prior to the incident.-	2016-03-07 02:17:46Z	user10800	1	0	diet, pain, neurology, addiction, food-addiction

In the past month, I've had what I believe to be ear infections (or maybe just hardened earwax) in one ear and then 2 weeks later, the other ear. They are extremely painful, and I've been taking pain killers. This has severely effected my work. Sometimes when I poke my finger into my ear and scrape with my fingernail, large chunks of ear wax comes out. I don't remember this every happening when I was younger. I'm trying to learn more about how I can prevent this by understanding how I should treat my ears in order to prevent this from happening in the future. I've been cleaning the hole in my ear with my wash cloth which has soap on it using a single finger. Is this bad? Will this actually increase the amount of earwax or possibly the soap mixes with the ear wax in some way leaving infection prone residue in my ear?   I've also noticed that I have these problems when I was using Dove soap, which I've always felt the residue burns the skin.

Are there any studies that attempt to address this? Related questions: Is there any information on the reported duration of ganglion cysts in the case that they do spontaneously resolve?

Ive checked the definition, and if I understand it, this means that the receptors are permanently blocked through some reaction with this antagonist. The question is:  Does it mean that this cell which receptors are blocked is defective forever?  And side effects will never go away because, in this case, cell needs histamine to work properly?

Because, as it stands right now, I am only flossing about 50% of my teeth.

4776	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4776/is-hemotoxic-snake-venom-safe-to-ingest	Is hemotoxic snake venom safe to ingest? [closed]	I have heard that snake venom is safe to ingest. Normally when I hear about this it is about hemotoxic venoms such as that of a rattlesnake. The argument towards snake venom being safe to ingest is that snake venom is digested into amino acids. However no matter the kind of venom there are always going to be side effects from ingesting it. For hemotoxic venom it is internal bleeding in the peritoneum as well as anemia. This is really bad because the person will be in a lot of pain, barely conscious if at all, and have the symptoms of anemia. Rattlesnake venom in particular also causes nausea and vomiting so it can feel like you have a severe stomach infection. For neurotoxic venom it is the digestive system not working at all or digesting too fast depending on the venom. For myotoxic venom it is muscle injury which can cause muscle soreness. For cytotoxic venom it is killing of all cells. However if we had a natural antivenom(like our antibodies reacting to the venom and our wbcs getting rid of it) we could use cytotoxic venom to cure cancer if our cytotoxic T cells aren't active enough. For cardiotoxic venom it is the heart stopping or beating too fast. In fact I think that snake venom is more acid resistant than most proteins and so less will be digested. Also the proteins might be too complex for pepsin to break them down. So is hemotoxic snake venom safe to ingest or is it something with a high risk of poisoning if it gets ingested and there are no wounds in the digestive system? -	2016-02-15 22:18:31Z	Caters	2	0	digestion, poison, venom

I've heard on multiple occasions from less than credible sources that dieting by eating less (usually implemented by skipping meals, not smaller meals) will cause the human body to enter some sort of "starvation" mode where it hoards calories because it thinks it might not get more calories in the future. Most people also mention it can cause an increase in weight. The people I hear it from say it like it's common sense and widely believed so they never have anything to support it. "That's just the way it is" they claim. There's a lot of variables at play here and I'm no biologist or nutritionist but I'm interested in knowing if there's any research backing this claim. Is there a starvation mode that your body can fall in to? If so, what triggers it? Has there been any research into how the body reacts to fewer feeding times and overall less calories? What are the long term (6+ months?) affects of a diet like this if a person can still ensure proper nutrient intake aside from calories? I'm not talking about extreme fasting or starvation diets. I'm thinking diets with 1000-1500 calories a day in a consistent fashion (taking in roughly the same amount of calories at roughly the same time of day).

The value has consistently been in the 55-60 range for several weeks (most typical value over the past week or two is 57).  Over the past few days, however, it jumped to around 62; a 10% increase. The bulk of the increase occurred 2 days ago, and the only thing I can think of that happened within that timeframe is that I got a mild sunburn (from kiteboarding, so primarily on my face/forehead from looking up at the sky all afternoon).  But correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation.  So my question is, can a sunburn lead to an increase in the body's resting heartrate?  And if so, why? I know a Fitbit isn't a medically accurate device, and that there's pending litigation over whether they're accurate  .  However my anecdotal experience with my particular device is that it's quite accurate when at rest (during strenuous exercise the instantaneous readings can indeed be a bit funky and it can temporarily lose count altogether; although the average values that get logged to the dashboard seem reasonable despite the transient outliers/glitches).

I was talking with somebody who believes that when having stomach flu (gastroenteritis) and feeling nausea, you should try to vomit. This person's theory is that the stomach flu virus makes some foods (the ones that cause nausea) toxic to the body.

Then, after the toxic food is vomited out, the body is relieved and can recover more easily from the stomach flu. I thought this was an absurd theory and that you should try to avoid vomiting while having stomach flu to prevent the loss of nutrients.

Can anyone tell me how much allergen is present in an allergy shot, so I can compare to the quantity in this homeopathic solution?  Thanks!-	2016-01-21 19:08:20Z	D. K.	1	0	allergy

My wife and I would like to have another child, but would very much not like to try if the probability of this occurring again is above a certain threshold (of which we have already settled on one). All 3 doctors I have consulted were unable to give a definitive cause of death, nor were any willing to give a numerical estimate of the probability (whether for reasons of legal risk, or something else) that our next baby will be stillborn. I am likely too distraught to properly evaluate my situation and would very much appreciate an independent (from mine) probability estimate of what caused my son to die, and given that cause, how likely it is that our next child will die as well. : V (L and my only biologically related living son) had no complications during birth, nor has he showed any signs of poor health whatsoever. L has a cousin who has had two miscarriages, and I have an aunt who had several stillbirths followed by 3 live births of healthy children. We know of no other family members that have had similar misfortunes. J (my deceased son) was the product of a 31 week gestation. L (my wife and J's mother) is 28 years old, gravida 2, para 1. L presented to the physicians office for routine prenatal care and noted that she had not felt any fetal movement for the last five to six days. No fetal heart tones were identified. It was determined that there was an intrauterine fetal demise. L was admitted on 11/05/2015 for induction and was delivered of a nonviable, normal appearing, male fetus at approximately 1:30 on 11/06/2015. : According to a leading obstetrics textbook1, causes of stillbirth are commonly classified into 8 categories: obstetrical complications, placental abnormalities, fetal malformations, infection, umbilical cord abnormalities, hypertensive disorders, medical complications, and undetermined. Below, I'll list the percentage of stillbirths in each category (which may be used as prior probabilities) along with some reasons for or against.  (29%)  (24%)  (13%)  (14%)  (10%)  (9%)  (8%)  (24%) What is the most likely cause of death? How likely is that cause? Given that cause, if we choose to have another child, then how likely is it to survive its birth? Are there any other ways I could reduce uncertainty (additional tests, etc...) that I haven't listed here? Are there any other forums where these questions are more likely to get good answers? Why won't doctors give probabilities? Help with any of these questions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. If your advice to me is to consult another expert (in addition to the 2 obstetricians and 1 high-risk obstetrician I already have consulted), please also provide concrete tactics as to how to find such an expert and validate their expertise.-	2017-03-09 10:18:15Z	Butterfly and Bones	2	0	miscarriage, 3rd-trimester, birth-defect

4339	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4339/maximum-safe-dosage-of-zinc-for-4-6-weeks	Maximum safe dosage of zinc for 4-6 weeks	After refractive surgery, the doctor suggested taking 1000mg of vitamin C daily to help minimize scarring.  When I went to pick up the vitamins, I also noticed that there was a supplement claiming to be designed to support eye health that also included vitamin C.  Specifically, it has: ...per tablet.  The recommended dosage is 1 tablet/day, and I'd have to take 4 times that amount to get 1000mg of vitamin C/day.   From what I can determine 800 IU of vitamin E and 4 mg copper are within safe/tolerable limits, however 160mg of elemental zinc is quite high.  There are only a few conditions I can find where dosages around that level are recommended for therapeutic purposes: So my question is, what's the safe maximum dosage of zinc over a course of 4-6 weeks?  From what I can find, it seems like the biggest risk is that high dosages of zinc lead to copper deficiency (hence why it's used to as a treatment for Wilson's disease).  Does it therefore follow that 160mg/day should be okay as long as it's supplemented with some extra copper and not continued on a long-term basis?-	2016-01-10 02:52:36Z	aroth	4	2	dosage, supplement

In it, a character has a deep laceration across their throat which has been hastily stitched up.  Upon drinking some water, they find that it passes straight through the stitched-up wound.   The solution presented in the film is to rub some gunpowder (assuming period accuracy, this would be early 1800's black powder, not the modern stuff) into the wound and then ignite it.  Presumably to seal the wound more completely by cauterizing it.

When a car passes me, I can always know by the smell if the driver were smoking or not (and I systematically try to hold breath and anticipate that), I can also smell some other odors of the inside of the car, but I don't smell the exhaust pipe gases.  I'm wondering if I'm alone in that case, is it normal? I'm quite paranoiac when it comes to breathing cigarette smoke, so I don't know if it affects only me. I've searched and posted other threads concerning tobacco smoke, and I'm convinced the amount of tobacco smoke on  a road is not insignificant compared to gas exhaust, of course it's less, but it represents more than 1% (at least here in France) and it's really concentrated when you're in. Smoking tends to generate a lot more particles than people think  ,  , and possibly more toxic ones  ,  ,  So is my case 'normal'? Am I alone to smell the cigarette smoke trails in the traffic (on a bike I mean, for those of you that sometimes do bike, I don't think I'd smell them if I were in a car too)?

4238	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4238/multidrug-treatment-to-prevent-evolution-of-resistance	Multidrug treatment to prevent evolution of resistance	I was just reading   in PLOS Medicine on the treatment of multidrug resistant TB.  They suggest that treatments are more effective if a large number (more than 5) treatments are used simultaneously.   I know also that many infectious diseases are currently treated with combination therapies (eg ACT for malaria, atripla for HIV) to slow the evolution of drug resistance.  I was curious if there was a down side to using every (or almost every) available treatment for a given infectious disease, instead of one or a few?   Certainly some treatments come with side effects which are unpleasant enough to avoid them from the start, and there may be instances where different drugs interact to be less effective (or in combination tolerated only in lower, less effective doses).  But in general, is there a downside to hitting infectious agents with every potentially effective treatment as a matter of course?-	2015-12-30 14:51:46Z	JohnP	2	1	infectious-diseases, evolution

I usually set my alarm really loud so that I will definitely wake up. Usually that is accompanied by disorientation, headaches, etc. However, I read about 'completing the sleep cycle' and that it allows for more fulfilling sleep, along with easier waking up, so I started finding ways to implement that. One way that occurred to me: what if I set my alarm to 'endless mode' but lower the volume to around 30%? I read that it is very difficult to wake a person in deep sleep, but it becomes easier in light sleep. In this way, when I am in deep sleep I won't wake up, but when I transition into light sleep, then the lower volume will be enough to wake me up. Is this a good technique?-	2015-12-30 04:32:14Z	M.

Several of my coworkers take regular smoke breaks outside the office a few times per day. I don't smoke, but I join them once or twice a day. There are a few reasons why I find it valuable to do this: I'm aware of some of the research around secondhand smoke. In particular, I'm aware that it's  , which means that the risk increases with exposure, and that even a small amount of exposure can be harmful. Furthermore, the effects of secondhand smoke are  .

Our 8-month old son is doing very well so far, developing physically and mentally right in lock step with where the "developmental miletstones" say he should be. At around 4 months of age we noticed he started developing a small red mark on his arm that kept getting a little bit bigger every few weeks. At his 6-month well visit the pediatrician said it was a  , and that it was nothing to worry about. Furthermore, she said: I asked if there were any surgeries available to remove it and she stated that surgical removal often exacerbates them and makes them worse and/or more dangerous. While this was all very reassuring, it has now almost doubled in size since that 6-month well visit, and is now roughly the size of a thumbtack, so it appears to be picking up " ". If you Google mastocytoma, you get back a slurry of articles/blogs/etc. that give mixed information. Some coincide with what the pediatrician said and they state that mastocytoma is nothing to worry about. Others state that while its typically benign, it can become malignant and dangerous under certain conditions. I guess I'm worried that the pediatrician is simply trying to relieve/placate us by telling us that "it's alright". Meanwhile, it's doubling its size every few months. So I ask:   What signs/symptoms/changes take us from the "definitely benign" zone into the murky in-between zone? Would a trip to the dermatologist be a prudent next step?

My girlfriend and I follow a ketogenic diet (I have been doing this for almost 3 years now and my girlfriend for almost a year). I would like my daughter to also follow a (somewhat) ketogenic diet.

3872	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/3872/what-does-dairy-sensitivity-feel-like-to-an-infant	What does dairy sensitivity feel like to an infant?	We have a 4-month-old, exclusively breast-fed, with dairy sensitivities. Mom has eliminated dairy from her diet, which brought a huge improvement. A couple weeks ago we slowly reintroduced dairy (a couple biscuits made with milk) and confirmed the sensitivity is still there. Has there been any research on what the infant is actually experiencing? When she was younger, it seemed an almost acute pain - sitting happily one second then an utterly pained cry the next, refusal to be set down, etc. During the recent reintroduction it didn't seem to be as painful, but just a general discomfort - wanting to be held, but no pain cry. The oddest thing though was the effect on sleep. Before the reintroduction she'd been sleeping through the night without issue. During, she would wake up 2-3 times per night. Upon waking she would lie there and babble, or work her hand out of the swaddle to suck on her fingers, and one time she just hollered (loud noises, but not unhappy). It just seemed like she was ready to be awake and play. We eventually just nursed her to get her to go back to sleep, but she never really got upset and "needed" to nurse. Really I'm just curious what she might be going through, as I obviously don't have an intolerance and she can't tell me. Her changing reactions haven't helped me figure it out either.-	2015-11-28 03:23:12Z	Drew	2	1	dairy

3838	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/3838/can-gerd-be-caused-by-too-little-stomach-acid	Can GERD be caused by too little stomach acid?	Ever since the book,  , I've wondered if it is true that GERD can be caused by too little, not too much, stomach acid. Is it possible that too little stomach acid can cause GERD? If so, by what mechanism would this occur? I dont disagree with the fact that GERD is caused by a malfunctioning lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and I dont disagree with known causes that would contribute to a malfunctioning LES, but what seems very likely to me is that low stomach acid is an additional cause of a malfunctioning LES. This reasoning behind this is that undigested food is putrefying and rotting, expelling gas within the stomach, then increasing pressure on the LES. It could even be possible that low stomach acid is the cause in a large majority of the cases of GERD. There is an entire integrative medicine field, aka holistic health, that has identified in many cases GERD is actually caused by too little stomach acid ( ,  ,  ). And while I am usually not one to ever listen to this field of medicine, they make some really astute observations. I realize this isnt what the mainstream doctors believe, but the mainstream is being influenced by a 15 billion dollar industry. The PPI section in the store is huge. Ive been to multiple gastro docs, and its like assembly line Prilosec prescribing. Two people who know our family, that have both been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, just happen to be taking Prilosec / Nexium for many years prior. Another friend had to have is colon cut out because of a bacterial infection, which could have been caused by the elimination of the bodys first line of bacterial defense (stomach acid). All evidence pointing to low stomach acid seems legitimate, so why not give it proper attention. So here Id like to diagram what I believe to be the problem: the step-ladder catch-22 inflammation and putrefication snowball effect. Remember, all of this is on the basis that when it comes to low stomach acid, GERD is being caused by the rotting / putrefication of food in the stomach (due to the pyloric sphincter remaining shut) and the resulting gasses which bubble up past the 2-way LES causing GERD. Then, the rotting food causes  , and the problem starts to compound. It basically goes like this: When you go down this step-ladder road for a few months, the avenue out of it is daunting, if not impossible. In my opinion, we could have millions of sufferers in our country, and for that reason I want to find out the truth.-l3793nddas8aweqb5zlf	2017-03-07 10:25:41Z	Pills N Pillows	8	0	gastroenterology, stomach, gerd-acid-reflux, acidic, lower-esoph-sphincter-les

Also, in theory, if there would be an advancement that would allow them to move their bones with the aid of artificial muscles, would their bones be rigid enough to still support them? If not, would there be a type of therapy combined with supplements that would help them regain strength in their bones?-	2015-11-22 23:39:36Z	Dave Liu	5	0	spine, bones

Being under general anaesthesia is physiologically not the same as sleeping. Sleep is needed in humans for restorative processes, a rule of thumb being 6 to 8 hours a day.

Sometimes the doctor has a website and will display his show his research papers but it's usually not the case, and when it's the case that doctor is often expensive and unbookable before 6 months. I don't have any condition that will make me die in the very short term. I have mostly conditions I'd like fixed and that can greatly improve my life.

Beyond the obvious fact that HSV-2 is far more common genital, and that I still wouldn't call it an 'ear infection' if he had HSV-2 around the ears, there are other warning signs and it's just not worth the risk.  I've already advised her to walk away quickly. However, I am curious now.  Just for the sake of completeness and my own knowledge (I get asked questions about STDs more then I ever expected, and while I'm not a medical expert but I   like to be informed enough to give accurate answers where I can), I was hoping someone could help confirm just how probable, or improbable, having HSV-2 on the ear really is?-	2016-11-12 02:35:59Z	Butterfly and Bones	4	0	sti, genital-warts, herpes-simplex, ear-infection, groin

[closed]	Periodically, I record my food intake.  Over the years, I've tried to hone my methods for capturing the most accurate data possible, but since I don't have my own lab, I am forced to rely on data that I find on a food label or online.  Recently, as I began recording a turkey burger I had eaten, I wondered how best to calculate the 1/8 of an ounce of olive oil I cooked it in.  Below is a description of how I prepare my turkey burgers and you'll see my dilemma: So, as you can see, this doesn't seem to be an easy matter of simply finding the nutrient data for 1/8 of a fluid ounce of olive oil.  Previously, I used to calculate just nutrient data for the turkey patties, and paid no attention to the oil I cooked it in.

I recently underwent a blood test, and during the third vial I passed out. I awoke just as the sixth was being finished and could not immediately stand. The vials were small, only 5ml each if I remember right, and the blood letting was at an NHS hospital, UK. In the few minutes after this, I discussed it with the nurse, only ever having fallen unconscious once (having hit a nerve cluster in my right knee). She noted that young men tend to fall unconscious far more than another demographic, although could not recall the reason why. I professed no prior knowledge of the subject, although prodded some weak ideas about height being a factor more than gender (I am ~190cm, or 6 feet 3 inches). Only one semi-satisfactory answer has been offered so far, and it's more a combination of answers than anything. Seeing as full blood donations are never done by children, data is only really available from adults, another nurse I know personally offered from her experience that more nervous patients tend to pass out more often, but that they too tend to be men. It was then theorised that since the nervousness is known to move blood away from the brain and towards muscles, this would accentuate the blood loss, causing unconsciousness. She also said young men were likely more nervous due to inexperience with any meaningful amount of blood. Is this a simple, personal observation, perhaps even a white lie so as to keep a weakened patient calm, or is this backed by any statistical data?

The problem isn't that I feel the need to clean my teeth frequently, but that when I decide to clean them I simply have to clean them a lot. And it has already went so far that I began to split days into "good" days (not cleaning my teeth) and "bad" days (cleaning my teeth). Sometimes I can't even enjoy the rest of the day if I know that I will have to clean my teeth on that particular day.

Can removal of internal organs affect the posture of the body, or cause the stomach to protrude?-	2017-04-18 03:16:52Z	Pills N Pillows	8	0	posture, removal, uterus, internal-organs

Her respiratory values are as follow BEFORE treatment: pH = 7,36 PCO2 = 48 mmHg PO2 = 70 mmHg She is treated with 100% oxygen and the values after treatment are: pH = 7,35 PCO2 = 52 mmHg PO2 = 145 mmHg I am now asked to calculate her alveolar-arterial gradient and thereafter explain whether this number is indicative of a Va/Q mismatch. I calculate her A-a gradient to be 21 mmHg. An expected A-a gradient would be roughly 20 mmHg for her age. This seems normal? I tried with an external calculator as well and the values are normal too? Why is she admitted to the ICU if her A-a gradient is completely normal and then treated so that her A-a gradient goes severely down?

The goal of that post was to sell some fancy shaving tools and not really educate people about how to care for their skin (face and the rest of the body).

When I first started getting floaters in my eyes (several years ago), my opthalmologist told me that they don't go away but over time your brain learns to ignore them/filter them out.  This seems to be largely true in my case; what, at onset, was very invasive is now mostly not a problem.  But sometimes they become more prominent again, usually for a few minutes at a time.

3420	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/3420/effects-of-arbs-on-potassium-levels	Effects of ARBs on potassium levels	Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used to treat hypertension. One of the side effects of these drugs is to raise serum potassium levels. This occurs because ARBs block the effects of angiotensin II on receptors, which leads to reduced aldosterone production. Aldosterone causes retention of sodium and excretion of potassium, thereby lowering serum potassium levels. My question is whether this effect is immediate or delayed. For example, if a person begins taking an ARB daily, will its effect on potassium levels be the same on day 1 as it will be on day 30?  Assume normal kidney function and no other drugs. If the particular ARB matters, consider losartan. -	2015-10-16 01:30:50Z	Carey Gregory	10	0	medication

When referred to a gastroenterologist for intermittent pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen (slightly under the rib cage), my friend was told that she probably had an ulcer and the doctor needed to do an endoscopy to confirm.  My friend has gone to two doctors so far regarding intermittent but intense pain in the upper right quadrant of her abdomen (slightly under the rib cage). Her GP considered it to be possibly gallstones and referred her to a gastroenterologist to get an ultrasound and further treatment. The gastroenterologist, however, thought it was most likely an ulcer and that he would need to do an endoscopy. I'm   looking for an internet diagnosis for her :) Her primary concern is that an ultrasound is less expensive and doesn't involve sedation or require a day of fasting, and she wonders whether the gastroenterologist has chosen a less likely avenue to pursue since he would get paid much more for it. To that end, she wants to know  , and potentially consult another specialist before undergoing an endoscopy.

How can a patient decide on his activity level? What signs are there that there is too much or too little activity?  Also, if activities should be reduced: is there a difference between types of activities?

Also, is an activity which is known to be irritating to either hearing (e.g. being around persistent noise) or balance (e.g. being driven in a car on a mountain road with many turns) worse than other kinds of activity?

Recently, I   to reproduce the technique: The hiccups didn't stop this time, so I thought I must have mistaken the breathing order. Therefore I tried reversing: Once I stood up, I immediately felt symptoms described in   (found this page through a comment to  ): I squatted down again after approximately 3-5 seconds and the symptoms subsided (with the exception of the headache, which lingered for a while), and I still had the hiccups. I gave up on the technique and later managed to stop the hiccups while having some yogurt in my mouth and drink it with the head down (close to my knees). I'm assuming that in the second sequence the blood flows rapidly to the legs and at the same time to the diaphragm to help filling the lungs, causing a blood pressure fall, and the head, in this case, is primarily affected. I'd like to confirm if this makes any sense.-	2017-04-13 12:53:20Z	Community	5	0	blood-pressure, inhalation, blood-circulation

I do eat dairy products and try to make sure I have a portion of protein at every meal. Usually milk and nuts and breakfast, cheese at lunch and eggs, quorn, soya or pulses at dinner. I do not take any vitamin supplements as I am aware there is zero evidence they are effective in boosting health. I chose to become vegetarian for ethical reasons, but have always understood it's generally healthier than eating meat, which is a bonus. Recently, however, I have noticed that I'm having mild symptoms which could be associated with iron or protein deficiency: I have less energy than usual, and my hands and feet get cold quickly and don't warm up easily. These issues are minor and more of an irritation than a real burden. It's also possible they could just be encroaching middle-age. My children, 5 and 9, have been vegetarian their whole lives (and refuse to eat any fish) and don't seem to lack energy. I am wondering whether it might be beneficial to start eating shellfish (scallops, oysters, clams etc) on an occasional basis. These foods are rich in protein and iron and would seem to be a relatively ethical choice, lacking the nervous structure of higher animals. I also think there may be additional health benefits from having a small amount of seafood in my diet. The questions   has some useful information, but does not contain anything about seafood.

[closed]	For the past several years, I've been cooking for myself, but from the start, I never took   into account. I've just been eating until the last morsel on my plate was consumed (and there was sometimes enough food for multiple people) on my plate. This seems to have led me to feel the need to consume more and more during each meal before I feel full. Nowadays, I never feel satiated. Instead, my stomach just feels like "one more bite will make me throw up," yet I'm still hungry for more food. Today, so as to not eat myself broke, I drink several litres of water (usually 3 to 5 litres, or 100oz to 170oz) per meal   and hope that the water will help me reach that point where my stomach is so full that I'm about to throw up. I've tried eating less to perhaps lessen this problem, but then not only do I not feel satiated, but my stomach doesn't feel "filled" either, and I leave the kitchen craving food. To put this into perspective: whenever I eat out with friends at a place that serves a proper, standard, wholesome dinner, everyone I'm with seems to feel absolutely full--sometimes stuffed--from the meal they order. Often times, they would need to bring leftovers home. But to me, their meal was just a small snack. The only temporary solution I have to this problem is exercising frequently: a 3km jog everyday. My BMI has always been and still is ~20.4. What's wrong with me? Where did my satiety signal go?-	2015-09-26 23:40:26Z	Nixu	1	0	nutrition, brain, food-addiction

Running away from stress is definitely   today's world.  The doctor said: "I can inject cortisol liquid into the skin". Maybe acceptable, but however the lose may keep going, though. After injections, the skin is going down and begin to lose its elasticity, and got old. So, cortisol is harmful for skin even though it was a bit good choice.

I am assuming our body would undergo some changes to adapt to the new environment. I have recently graduated and came back to home, both in different cities. Within a span of 4 months now, I feel not as energetic as I used to feel in my college. I went for check up and thankfully, everything is alright. Nothing major happened. Not to mention the water and diet in my hometown is different from what was there in college. I feel that I frequently experience gas and acidity problems, I sometimes get gags too.

They are fairly close to my "normal" teeth: generally, the only impact of them on my everyday life is a slight pressure I sometimes feel on the sides of my tongue. However, my dentist has suggested that I get these teeth extracted, as the gap between them and my "normal" teeth is difficult to clean and they serve no real positive purpose, and if they decay, they may affect the function of my "normal" teeth. I am partly hesitant to agree to this because of memories of painful tooth extractions in my childhood. That's a personal issue, but I also don't know how much such a procedure would involve (and cannot ask my dentist at the moment), and having more knowledge might ease some of the distress about possibly getting the procedure done.

[closed]	Ear infections are not contagious, and most resolve without antibiotics. There are risks inherent with excessive antibiotic use as well as many allergies and negative side effects. Ear tubes require cutting into a healthy membrane, leave scars, have multiple side effects, and frequently don't solve the problem of chronic infections. The anesthesia required for the procedure carries its own risks. With these negatives in mind and knowing that the body already has a tube designed to do the same thing without the risks why are more efforts not made to improve their function?  Why is our current treatment standard despite the known risks, when other options are obviously still unexplored. There is not enough research done on many treatments such as balloon inflation as cited by the chochrane review ( ) and  stents which has studies both ways.

2010	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/2010/preventive-extraction-of-permanent-teeth	Preventive extraction of permanent teeth	I am 32 years old man now and I think about such an interesting problem. My teeth are very strong and still develop, but not as before, so they grow not so fast as in my twenties. Now I look in the past and think, what could I have done to make my teeth situation better with my today's knowledge.  Recently I had extraction of my upper right first molar. From dentists I had not heard anything distinct and intelligible about my discomfort about this tooth. ca. 5 years ago a dentist made a small filling on it, in the center. Still I was already then very skeptical about this approach and asked to remove the tooth, but was told, also by respected dentists that it is   and I must in any case try to   the tooth.   Few times a year, since then, especially with fast growing air temperature and humidity, and especially before heavy rain or storm, I had bad discomforts, which sometimes grown into some kind of animal fear, but I didn't have real pain, like in case of caries or pulpit. 3 months ago I had another small caries on this tooth (upper six), I went then to the dentist and insisted on tooth extraction, and I have this tooth pulled. Doctor told first about making root canal (strangely used the same phrase " "), but I stood on my point. And what a wonder, now it is all gone! I can even breath with nose better now. I consider now everything what have happened and other teeth state and come to following idea: in my case I would've my tooth pulled much earlier, say at 20 years, and interestingly, the same I could tell about lower first molars. I don't know how, but it seems that I could have much less problems with teeth now, just because they sit too dense and they press on each other which is causing really frightening processes. My both lower wisdom teeth were extracted at 25 years. One lower molar has root canal treatment.   So my hypothesis is that extraction of teeth, in young years can solve many problems. As said, in my case I would say it would be both wisdom teeth, say in age 18, and then just pull the first molars when they start to decay or if not decayed before say, age 25-30, just pull which looks like a good candidate. It sounds a bit strange and sadistic but for me it would be much better than making those fillings. And I see now in my case, it can be  .  In my case it seems that the strong roots started to grow into some areas which they are not supposed to touch, but there are too many theories about it. Anyway the simplest solution was to extract it. So such a question bothers me:  Note that I had no visible anomalies, such as tooth row deformation in younger years, so my teeth look normal and I started to feel pressure only at ca. 23 years.  -	2015-09-02 15:26:34Z	Mikhail V	3	1	dentistry

I'm working on a science-fiction story, and a recent scene deals with someone tampering with the O2 levels of a ship's recycled atmosphere.  I find myself wondering,    In other words, what were the ship's O2 levels set to before they were changed? According to my research Earth's air generally runs around 20.8-21% oxygen, and can be dangerous if it dips below 19.5% or so.  The ISS, for example, uses a basic sea-level air mixture of about 21%.  On the flip side, many athletes spend time in oxygen-rich environments to improve their training, and I know many scuba divers who use   tanks with up to 40% oxygen to give them energy and increase their focus, etc.  However, I also know that using enriched air like that can lead to long-term issues and oxygen toxicity at certain levels. So my question is,    If you could control the air mixture of a ship, would it be more beneficial to set it at 25%, or 30%, etc? And just to be clear: I'm looking only for the longterm effects of the oxygen mixture on human health, and not other practical considerations (like chance of combustion, decompression, etc).-	2015-08-31 17:12:08Z	Nerrolken	4	1	breathing, oxygenation, air-quality

Last night, I read a horror story about a baseball coach who assaulted his star player after training because she made his son look bad as the eternal number 2.  He fed her peanuts while she had a nut allergy twice and then forced himself on her. There were several minutes between the time she was first fed the nuts and when she managed to use her epi-pen, at least enough time for her coach to feed her a second handful of nuts, drag her into the announcer's area and violate her. What I found weird was that she started feeling better instantly and managed to overpower the coach, run away, ambush him and beat him to death with her baseball bat in a few minutes. She also didn't go to the hospital afterwards to get further treatment for the reaction. I thought that an epi-pen needed more time to work, especially if there's also the stress from the simultaneous assault.

The patient saw the physician the day after the rash appeared; diagnosis took about a week.  The date of the bite was not known; the patient never saw the tick.  Treatment started with oral antibiotics but symptoms (joint pain, primarily) remained and the physician followed with a month-long course of IV antibiotics.  I do not know which specific drugs were used.  Total time from first visit to the end of the IV treatment was about five months. At the time the patient was told by the physician that the blood test for Lyme looks for antibodies, which would "always be there now", which is why it was not possible to say with certainty that the disease had been treated.  The patient was also told that the characteristic bull's-eye rash only appears in about 25% of cases.  Years have passed since this happened. If this patient were to be bitten by another tick in the future, would it be possible to make a determination of Lyme Disease?  If so, how? (The patient takes appropriate precautions but knows that nothing is ever 100% effective.)-	2015-08-16 23:02:50Z	Monica Cellio	7	0	diagnostics, lyme-disease

I was given a giant gummy bear for my birthday. I ate it in one sitting, just a few days ago. And then, I searched Google about diabetes. Now, there are three things troubling me. Soon after I ate the giant gummy bear, I felt very tired - a symptom of diabetes. From the day after I ate the gummy bear, I noticed my breath was slightly sweet. It usually smells really bad before I brush teeth in the morning. It stayed like that, which got me worried. Today, my cough worsened. I had a drink. After brushing teeth, I coughed in the sink, which caused the drink to go up my nose and mouth - basically, I threw up. It could a symptom of diabetes, or just an effect of coughing with my head down like that. Now, those three are symptoms of diabetes and I'm getting seriously worried.

A few nights ago, I was using my laptop outside in the dark. Some moths and other insects were flying around in the light it was emitting, but unfortunately I didn't think anything about this from a bat's perspective.  Suddenly (and incredibly silently) something flew into my face, completely blocking my vision momentarily. I thought at first that it was a giant moth, but it was too fast for a moth, and besides, it flew away immediately. But it took a few moments to realize that it was the wing of a flying bat that had basically hit me in the face. I had no scratches, no blood, didn't feel any fluid when it hit me, and I washed myself well. About 15 years ago, I was exposed to the saliva of a known rabid animal and had completed a post-exposure prophylaxis series of 5 vaccines as well as getting a rabies immune globulin shot, so I wasn't overly concerned. I know that any significant first exposure to a potentially rabid animal, or a possible rabies-vector (bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, etc.) merits a visit to an emergency room and immunization.

1865	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1865/whats-the-difference-between-etiology-pathogenesis-pathology-pathophysiology	What's the difference between etiology, pathogenesis, pathology, pathophysiology and epidemiology?	Most of my searches either end up explaining any of the above words in terms of the other four, or explaining the concept in simple words in such a way that makes it difficult to see the difference between them. A simple google search took me to medicinenet.com -  pathology -  "that branch of medicine which treats of the essential nature of disease." etiology - "The study of causes, as in the causes of a disease." Pathogenesis: "The development of a disease and the chain of events leading to that disease." So I decided to try wikipedia as, I felt, all   will necessarily fail to actually explain the differences between them as the differences are pretty nuanced. But wikipedia articles on these terms were either very detailed or very general, in the sense that although I understood what they were saying in any particular article, I still couldn't figure out how the rest of the terms were referring to something different. All seemed to mean - understanding why and how diseases work/spread and how to control them.  The only term I understood distinctly here was epidemiology, which means studying the occurrence of diseases in a given population (thus putting a geographical limitation). I guess I'm looking more for an explanation which draws a parallel to convey the message. Definitions won't work. For ex, if someone were to ask me the difference between environment, habitat, ecotone and niche, I would try something along the lines of -  Environment = library Habitat = different sections (like literature, reference, philosophy etc) Ecotone = gate of library Niche = the place a particular student occupies in that library through his interaction with other students etc-	2016-02-22 07:31:04Z	Yuganka Sharan	3	1	terminology, pathophysiology

So, would my immune system (and my health in genera) have equivalent results as it has if I really put my effort to do exercise?-	2015-08-05 15:59:56Z	Ooker	3	0	exercise, immune-system
1783	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1783/do-hepa-air-filters-serve-any-health-benefit	Do HEPA air filters serve any health benefit?	I have been researching particulate matter pollution and air filters. I read about HEPA air filters and that they can capture over 99% of particles in the air, including allergens. I was thinking that might mean HEPA air filters could really help with indoor air pollution and keep people healthier, especially in locations with high particulate matter, and especially in homes with fuel-based heating in the home. I assume this should help with asthma, allergies, and may help prevent the effects of particulate matter. But I don't see any actual studies that show this when I google the topic, I feel almost all the results are trying to sell me an air filter instead of giving a scientific explanation of the benefits.-	2015-08-04 11:31:13Z	zagadka314	3	0	air-quality

1770	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1770/psychosis-while-using-prednisone-how-long-will-it-last	Psychosis while using prednisone: how long will it last?	I am 29 years old, male, and for about a year I have been treated with prednisone for an Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemy; I started with 50mg/day; the dose was sistematically reduced (now I am at 5 mg/day), since the anemy got better and since the following things happened. Already a few days (  I notice: I felt "normal" in that period) I was extremely agitated, I had few outburst and then I started to feel very confused, my head was blank and I also developed a maniacal behavoir (mostly of a political kind), but (and this is what really bugs me), when my mind was blank (on the bus, at the groceries store, in the office,..) images of sexual kind appeared in front of me and I   describe the whole thing loud (I was somehow   by  ; I am sorry: it is very difficult to explain, and I am not sure I understand it either).  I consulted a psychiatrist: his opinion is that the psychotic symptoms are a side effect of the prednisone; the hematologist confirmed and reduced the dose.  Now I can almost control  : when my mind goes blank I try to focus really hard on something till that feeling goes away. It doesn't work all the times, especially when I am tired, and it also gives me horrible head-aches.  Confusion, on the other side doesn't seem to get any better: sometimes I fell kind of lost, I barely understand what happens around me and what people are saying. So I wonder: how long will this torture last? If I stop taking the prednisone, will everything be solved? Neither the psychiastrist, nor the hematologist could answer me (they warned me about the problem of stopping abrouptly the cure with prednisone).  I am worried that the prednisone triggered something that was hidden in my mind, something with which I have to learn to live, and it scares me.-	2017-04-14 18:26:05Z	Pills N Pillows	2	0	mental-health, triggers, steroids

1762	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1762/severe-asthma-and-autoimmune-skin-reactions-with-no-relief	Severe asthma and autoimmune skin reactions with no relief [closed]	I have lived almost my entire life in Ross County, Ohio,  . I remember smelling the   when I was young, I don't even smell it anymore, but people comment about it when they are in Chillicothe. Much of my childhood involved using wood stoves or kerosene heating in the winter. I remember the year 2000 when my father had plastic wrap up instead of a wall and used kerosene for heating. When I was young, I was never able to run like everyone else, and my breathing bothered me from time to time. By the time I was in high school I no longer participated in any sports. But it wasn't until a few years ago, when I joined the Army, that I was diagnosed with asthma. It meant I could never meet the physical requirements and I was sent home from basic half way through, since the inhaler didn't help enough. But since then, it seems to be getting even worse. Two years ago we partially heated the house with a clothes drier, since it was very cold and the heater wasn't working at low temperatures, and I ended up in the emergency room a few times for my breathing difficulties, I could hardly stand at times. The doctor believed the clothes drier caused it because of the extra particulate matter.  Last year I moved to Warsaw, Poland, to attend a university (it is far, far cheaper and the cost of living is extremely low, so I was able to afford it), but my breathing got so bad I had to return to the US. While in Poland, a skin issue started to appear. It appeared on my legs, arms, and especially on my hands. I just realized it is only the areas that are generally exposed (below the knees, near the elbow and lower). I saw numerous dermatologists, which proscribed me multiple fungal creams, antibiotics, and finally steroids. It seems to get better and worse, but it has never gone away. At its absolute worse, it would randomly bleed, appear red, and itch. The skin remains dry. I now have a powerful steroid (Halcinonide Cream, USP 0.1%). I have been using it for 5 or 6 months, off and on (when it gets better and worse), but it never goes completely away. Recently it has covered almost the entire top part of my arms, from a bit above the elbow, to my knuckles, and the front of my legs, from the knees to my ankles. I also have a lot of dandruff now, which I never had before.  I returned to Warsaw for the summer, arriving in early may, and I am about to fly back to the US. With the lower cost of living, and the very low cost of medical care, it actually saved me to come here for the summer. I also met the woman I love here, and we got married this summer, which is the primary reason I came back! I plan to come back in December and have two teeth removed (with airline tickets, it is still cheaper than in the US). In the US, I live with my mother, close to a busy road. In Poland, the road isn't too busy, but pollution is high, and there is a bus terminal along the building, and a lot of buses come and go (which I'm sure releases a lot of DPM). My wife was recently told that our pet guinea pig likely exacerbates my asthma and caused my skin problem. We got him when it started getting cold (my breathing always gets worse at that time) and this is when my skin problems and breathing began to get worse. I ended up on strong steroid inhalers but it didn't help much. I constantly felt like I was drowning. In the spring, I stopped using the steroid inhaler because it wasn't helping all that much and I was back to my almost normal state. But I hate this normal state. I honestly can't remember the last time I didn't feel like something is stuck in my throat, like peanutbutter that won't go down. Sometimes I can't sleep and I feel tired for days. In the winters, I can hardly walk to my car without feeling like I'm suffocating. I didn't have heat in my car for awhile, which made things even more difficult.  I can't afford to move out of my mom's house. I don't know what else I can do about my breathing and my skin. I thought about buying a HEPA air filter, but they are very expensive, and I don't know how much that can help. I really don't know what more I can do, the doctors I have seen haven't helped much, and it is expensive and takes a lot of time I don't have. What options do I have? What should I try to do to help with my asthma and skin? (I almost never use the "rescue inhaler" unless I really   need to, but recently I need it more) Would the HEPA filter help me with this?

Needs opinions about the gym [closed]	Before going to see a doctor, I would like to get a few opinions here first. I am suffering tiredness since a few months now. Well, to be totally honest here, it usually comes and go and it's been like that for atleast 2-3 years now. I feel my energy very low and I do not want to do anything. Related or not but a year and a half ago, I was not feeling so well and had a few appointment with a psychologist. I stoped seeing that specialist when the words "pills to treat depression" went out of her mouth. Either because the sides effects scared me or I thought that I could fight it myself with exercises. For a while, I have been into exercise but recently, I have been so tired that I couldn't find the energy to hit the gym. For example, last night I slept for about 12 hours and this afternoon I couldn't resist taking a 2-3h nap and the wake up was hard. I doubt my sleep cycles are really good. I never seems to have deep sleep. Oh yeah, and I find my digesting system extremely slow: If I eat a good breakfast in the morning, I could skip the dinner without any problem. Having that fullness feelings following me all the rest of the day. So yeah, after reading a lot of articles over the past few days on Internet, I found out that it could be either the depression phase that came back harder this time without the unbearable sadness part. Some says that people have a hard time digesting carbs, it could explain why my digestive system is slow. It could drains me energy. Lacks of Iron. I am not a huge fan of red meat. Maybe, once a month? And I don't get supplements. Should I try to fight the tiredness and hit the gym anyway? If one of the above problem is true. Is it dangerous to drain my energy even more?

I doubt there is much of a placebo effect at work, since most of these either did or did not work when I first took them, without having expectations either way.

I was then prescribed tramadol  same results. I then tried naproxen, which worked rightaway. Is there an underlying mechanism, that explains why some of these work for some people while others don't?

I've included the circumstances for my question below, in case they can help you answer the question.  In my current project, I'm dealing with a disease that slowly replaces the blood cells of the human body with its own infectious replicas. These cells serve the same purpose as red blood cells, with the distinct disadvantage that they keep the body infected. In all other aspects, they are essentially red blood cells.  In addition to this, the disease eventually works its way into the bone marrow, stopping it from manufacturing red blood cells altogether. Instead, the bone marrow is forced to create more of the replicas.  The only way to cure an infected person (that I can see) would be to somehow cure the bone marrow and get it to produce red blood cells again. It is my understanding that blood cells are constantly dying and being reproduced, so repairing the bone marrow would eventually result in the bloodstream being repopulated with red blood cells, and the replicas dying out.   On that note, how long would it take the human body to completely replace its blood supply? Or is this even possible? -	2015-07-24 23:09:42Z	Thomas Myron	3	0	blood

Background: I recently adopted a 3-year-old girl.  The first weeks in her new home, bedtimes were understandably difficult.  She had a lot of trouble falling asleep, and resisted going to bed. My wife and I realized that a lot of this probably had to do with anxiety surrounding the sudden life change (she was given little warning or preparation about her move).  We tried all kinds of bedtime routines to help her calm down and be able to sleep.  Eventually we worked out a system that worked relatively well, and resulted in a minimum of tantrums and resistance.  She would lie awake literally for hours.  She was calm and mostly non-interactive, but would just lie there staring at the ceiling, or talking softly to her stuffed animals, or playing with her fingers; finding ways to while away the time because she couldn't sleep.  When she finally did fall asleep, she would often wake again during the night, and then would have the same trouble falling asleep again, resulting in a severe lack of sleep. In consultation with her doctor, we began giving her melatonin about 1/2 hour before we put her into bed.  We started with 1mg, and then, when that didn't seem to be enough, we upped the dose to 2mg (again, as per her doctor). We have found that it works amazingly well, and gives her the ability to fall asleep quickly and to sleep through the night and feel well-rested in the morning. We've been doing this for about 2 months now. There have been a couple of nights where we forgot to give her the melatonin, or just decided to see how she does without it, and it's immediately right back to the hours of non-sleep, so there's little chance that she can sleep well without it, at least in the near future. In researching melatonin online, it seems that there isn't a lot known about its long-term effects, and some websites warn that using it for children can cause problems for them later in life. I want my daughter to be able to sleep well, but I also don't want to do anything that may harm her, now or in the future, so I'm a little concerned about continuing to use the melatonin, since it appears she may need it for a while.-	2015-07-24 16:56:22Z	GentlePurpleRain	14	2	sleep, pediatrics

I regularly observe that if I strech or engage major muscles (chest or legs) my breathing rate quickens considerably in the space of just a few seconds (which is different when I'm not tired).

What should I do? [closed]	I've always had trouble with studying like a lot of other people. I have always been a great student but never had good grades. I love and understand Math, Chemistry and Physics better than many people(even those who get better grades than me) but I failed in two of them in the last exam. The main problem is attention. I am never able to keep my attention on anything; Even video games and other hobbies. But when my mom mentioned that I used to write letters in reverse when I was young, I went online and found out about dyslexia. I checked out   and to my surprise I found that I had a lot of them(20+) in common(I asked my mom, younger brother and elder sister to validate them). Now I'm pretty convinced that I might have dyslexia but there is no way I can confirm. I come from the poor country of Bangladesh. Psychiatrists are costly and aren't common here. People of my country think problems like schizophrenia are caused by paranormal creatures. My mom won't believe me at all and says that I made it all up in my mind; I just have to set myself free.

With different dandruff shampoos not really helping, I'm beginning to think that this isn't dandruff. Dandruff is a problem with the scalp. If I scratch my head in one spot without disturbing the hair strands much, nothing falls out. But if I don't touch my scalp at all and brush my hair back and forth with my fingers, it starts raining cats, dogs, and very small white particles that look like dried skin. But these particles don't look like the yellowed, slightly larger pieces of skin and oil that I've heard come with dandruff. So now I really don't know what to do.

He said no.  Needs to be water.  I didn't particularly care at the time - it was just a 'break the silence' question - but it started to grow on me.  Then it started to bug me.  Why not?  It still had H 2 and O.  Although diluted, the alkalites, minerals, fluoride and all the other stuff that comes from 'the man' is still there.  Or should be - maybe not.  Does citric acid or cool-aid and sugar break all that down. What if I drank a glass of OJ, then downed a glass of water right after. Did I get my water in then? Doesn't it mix after it all goes down?  Is there a time one has to wait before drinking anything other than water, after drinking water?

1530	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1530/can-tight-glasses-cause-headaches	Can tight glasses cause headaches?	I've been wearing glasses since I was about 7 years old (I am now 26). I wear glasses from the moment I wake up until I go to bed (except in the shower).  I've had this problem for a very long time where the glasses leave a dent in my head. I can clearly see it in the mirror whenever I have just taken off the glasses and can also feel it when I move over it with my hand. Aesthetics-wise, it doesn't bother me, but I feel that it gives me a headache at times, especially when it's warm or I've just done some heavy exercise. I think that the heat causes the veins in my head to expand, but they are unable to because they are pressed shut by my glasses. When I take off my glasses and feel the dent when it's hot or I've just done a workout, I can feel the veins pulsating easily. I usually get a headache, but it feels relieved when I take off my glasses for a bit. Is this perhaps a psychological effect or my tight glasses be causing headaches?  I've had similar problems with other frames in the past. I have taken my glasses to the store halve a year ago explaining my problem, but the people there didn't really say much.  They just took it to some other room, came back after 5 minutes, said they adjusted it a bit (I personally couldn't see a difference) and charged me 5 euros.  It didn't solve the issue I had at all but it did make me 5 euros lighter. EDIT September 2016: I notice this topic is gaining a lot of attention. The problem is actually solved now; the tight frames did in fact cause the headaches. At the time I posted this question I was wearing a metal frame that was not wide enough for my head (for 8 years). It's true that a skull is supposed to have those dents along the head, but the tight frames made it much more distinctive. 3 months ago I bought new glasses and I specifically looked for a frame that felt both comfortable and sturdy on my face. The frame now goes along the skin of my head instead of pushing it in. I no longer have the headaches which used to be so common for me. The trade-off is that it doesn't sit as tightly on my face as before, but I can run without my glasses falling off.-	2016-10-03 07:19:21Z	Pills N Pillows	9	1	headache, glasses

As an adult, I second guess all of my parents' advice, seeing that most of it was ridiculous, but some of them just might have been true. A large swath of it was connected to eyesight: "Don't watch too much TV or read too many books, you'll ruin your eyes", "Don't watch TV without a lamp on, you'll ruin your eyes", "Don't read lying down on your side", "Don't read books in the morning before you've had at least something to drink, better yet breakfast", "Don't hold the book too close or too far", "Don't wear sunglasses indoors", and probably others I don't remember any more.  They were never specific about what "you'll ruin your eyes" means, but as far as I know, the most usual vision problem in young people is myopia. But myopia's "works" through an anatomical mechanism, by having an eyeball of the wrong length, and I have no idea if any of these behaviors, or another one they failed to specify, can cause the eyeball to grow wrong.  Are there any known behaviors which cause or at least predispose for becoming myopic? Are any of the behaviors listed above connected to poor eyesight? Is it possible to reduce one's chances of becoming myopic by lifestyle and behavior change? If it is possible, does it only work before the process starts, or does it also slow down the progress of already existing myopia? -	2015-07-01 09:33:09Z	rumtscho	12	0	eye, behavior, lifestyle

As we are all aware, if you drink a large quantity of water in a short time period, you will  likely have to go to the toilet not too long afterwards. The body detects the increase in fluid volume (or more precisely in this instance the decrease in sodium concentration) and kicks off the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. This ultimately results in a decrease in anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) which in turn decreases water absorption from the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubule in the kidney. So my question is, if we rapidly consume a large volume of water in a very short period of time, could the resulting decrease in ADH hormone overshoot the mark and result in the body eliminating more water than what is ideal. That is, could drinking a large amount of water in a short time actually have a dehydrating effect?-	2015-06-30 14:44:57Z	Kenshin	2	0	renal

I have this habit where every morning I cook two fillets of tilapia for breakfast. I've been doing it every morning for over a year now. I do the cooking directly on the plate I'm eating on. I'll rub some avocado oil on a plate, put the two fillets on it, season it, and put it in the oven just like that. When it's ready I put the plate on the table (with a wooden shim below the plate so the heat won't damage the table) and I eat directly from the plate. Not having to wash an extra dish every day means a lot to me. I've been using plates made from porcelain and ceramics. Slowly over this time they've been breaking. So I ordered some plates from Amazon: These are made from an advanced material called Vitrelle, a complex glass-like material. They're completely white with no markings, and they're marketed as oven-safe. I cooked my tilapia in them a couple of times and they didn't break, so that's good. But then I thought to call Corelle and ask them to what temperature these plates are oven-safe. I spoke to the Corelle representative and he said the plates are oven-safe up to 176 degrees Celsius. (That's 350 Fahrenheit.) But I cook my fillets at 250 degrees Celsius (which is 480 Fahrenheit.) I could cook them at a lower heat but then they'd take longer to cook and I don't have much spare time in the mornings. Now of course, just because he said they're only safe up to 176 degrees doesn't necessarily mean they're not safe at 250 degrees. Maybe they are but the company doesn't want to take responsibility for that since most people won't check that when buying the product, so maybe it's just a cover-your-ass policy. My question is:   I'm only concerned regarding health issues, I'm not concerned about the plates breaking at all, because if they break it's something I can see and deal with, while if the plates are releasing toxins into my food and damaging my health, that's something I can't detect. -	2015-06-27 01:29:20Z	michaelpri	6	2	toxicity, food-safety

From a young age we were taught that the treatment for a nettle sting was to rub it with a dock leaf. Conveniently, docks usually grow close to where there are nettles.  As an adult if I get stung I have used the same treatment. It does seem to gradually calm the sting but it is difficult to say if the sting would be better without the treatment.  Looking around for dock leaves is a great distraction. Kids are really happy to be able to help and do something about the problem. I have also heard that getting stung with a nettle is "lucky" (think magic fairy type of lucky here - woo!) and also that it gives a boost to the immune system (now that sounds much more scientific!). These two things are another good distraction and comfort to kids especially.  Does rubbing the sting with juice of dock leaf simple rub away the sting needles? And does the juice dilute the chemicals injected in the sting? In the summer when the nettles are out and it is common to get stung I have found several times that no water is convenient (even in Ireland) so the best source of something cooling is a crushed dock leaf.  I believed nettles had an acid in the sting and that dock leaves had a base. And a simple acid+base=>salt+water neturalising reaction took place to calm the sting.  However, reading a bit more about this shows up different and sometimes contradictory information. It is hard to determine what are actual facts. What chemicals are involved depend on what article you are reading!  I think the facts on nettle sting are: Stinging nettles have sharp needles of silica(glass). There is a mix of chemicals which are injected by the needles. From wikipedia : several chemicals: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-HT (serotonin), moroidin, leukotrienes, and possibly formic acid. Doc leaves are related to sorrel (and related to rhubarb). The leaves contain oxalic acid and tannins.

The red cross claims that donating blood can 'save up to three lives'  That seems a highly exaggerated best case scenario.  I'm curious, how many lives are really saved from a unit of blood?  Specifically, what is the odds of one pint of whole blood producing a product which will be used to successfully treat an otherwise fatal injury/illness etc, and that if the donor had not donated that pint a death would have occurred due to lack of sufficient supplies, or being forced to use fewer resources of less computable ones? What I would love is the ability to do get as nuanced and exact numbers as possible, as part of the motivation of this question is to have the numbers needed to address another question on Skeptics.  If an answer doesn't want to do the exact math pointing me to the resources I need for me to do the math would be fine as well; but I don't even know what products are produced from a whole blood donation much less how to calculate the benefit of any one of those products. I know that blood type of the donor could play a factor here, but to address the question I'm interested in I'd prefer to know about the 'average' pint of blood, so in essence if all the donor of all the varous blood types in the US donated and you averaged all those various pings of different types together what would the average pint do?

What I am saying is, if you eat fast food everyday say at lunch time and if you count your calories every day, made sure you were not going over your calorie limit by eating something small for breakfast and dinner, like oats in the morning, and getting your servings of fruit and vegetables for dinner, and get regular exercise, going to the gym, not sitting down for too much, drinking plenty of water. Will you still get fat? My thinking is from what I know is weight lost is dependent on how many calories you put into yourselves and how many you burn off.

I'm trying to donate platelets more, now that I realize I can do it in between whole blood donations, though I admit I find the whole process far more annoying then whole blood. However, what I find odd is how I've gotten far more pressure to come back to donate platelets then I ever did donating red blood, and the first time the clearly pushed me to donating platelets over whole blood even when I really didn't know anything about it and just going along to help out however they wanted me to.   This last time I showed up I told them that I thought I was due to donate whole blood, and if so wanted to do whole blood since I didn't have time for platelets, but would donate platelets if I wasn't due for whole blood.  Again they seemed very eager to get me to donate platelets, to the point of seeming really disappointing when I ended up donating whole blood. It's inconvenient, to say the least, to loose so much time multiple times a month, I'm happy to do it to help, but I'd at least like to have an idea of exactly how much I am helping when I do it. So, is there a reason they seem so eager to get platelet donations?  Would it do more good to never donate whole blood and only ever do platelets?  Can anyone give me an estimation of how much good a platelet donation does   (not the best case, but the average case of each donation from a B+ donor)?  edit: To try to make this easier I finally sat down and tried to answer another question of mine:    See my answer to it.  The numbers are not guaranteed by me, I am a layman who doesn't really know much about the medicine behind the statistics I looked up, but it may give an answer some basis for comparison of the two options;   they assume any of my numbers are right.-	2017-04-13 12:53:20Z	Community	11	0	blood, blood-donation
1276	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1276/what-is-excess-blood-from-blood-donations-used-for-and-do-we-ever-run-out	What is excess blood from blood donations used for, and do we ever run out?	I regularly donate blood, however, I am curious as to what happens to my blood after I donate.  Obviously some of it will go to people in emergency medical situations, as I intend.  However, I have never heard of situations where someone died because we didn't have blood to donate to them; which makes it sound as if we don't have a blood deficit.  That in turn makes me wonder what the excess blood is used for. So I have two related questions.  First, do we ever   a blood deficit, situations where someone who could have been saved in a hospital dies because there wasn't blood to treat them?  Or specifically situations like that caused by a lack of donors, not some logistical issue getting it where it needs to be.  I have had the red cross call me and tell me that they have a 'deficit' many times, but frankly I hear it so often it leaves me questioning their definition of deficit.  How often do we really run out? Related, if we don't run a deficit then what happens to my excess blood?  I assume that some blood is regularly thrown out, but they figure it's better to have extra and risk it expiring then to run out during an emergency.  However, if we have a high enough surplus do they do something else with it?  For instance is it used for medical research?  If we had say 5% fewer donors would it be our medical research which suffered, but not patients in the hospital? I will continue donating blood regardless of the answer here.  I'm simply curious as to the result.  Well that and it informs this discussion: -	2017-04-13 12:46:45Z	Community	27	1	blood

I'm a 29 year old male, I live in an apartment, and the tenant above me is smoking a lot of marijuana every day and has been doing so for the last three months**. The fumes are entering my apartment through the HVAC system even when the system is turned off, my windows are open, and two air purifiers are on. I spend virtually every day in my apartment for almost the entire day. I jog 20min/day on the treadmill and my resting heart rate is around 65-75bpm when outside the apartment. While inside the apartment, I continuously experience:     I have logged my symptoms and they are stronger when the smoking occurs, but persist in a more mild fashion even after the smoking. When the smoking occurs, I also notice several red bars appear on my air purifier air quality indicator. My roommate is not as sensitive to the fumes as I am and only experiences a subset of the above symptoms and those at a much milder level. While outside of the apartment, all these issues disappear. QVAR has been able to slightly ameliorate only the issue of shortness of breath.    ** ( , but I still mention it in case it comes up: I'm 33% through my lease and I cannot get out of it because my roommate refuses to break the lease even if I pay for the termination fees. Further, upon complaining to the smoker, he denies everything (even though the fumes could be smelled from his windows when he used to have them open - before I complained). The management company is afraid to do anything because of potential legal repercussions. The police always arrives about 1h after the smoke has settled. I suffer under the symptoms even when the fumes are very weak and barely noticeable.)

I was prescribed a medication which can increase blood pressure as a side effect, so I impulsively bought a small home BP measurement unit of the foolproof kind. It is made by a known brand for home medical electronics, so I think it's of reasonable quality. I've never operated one before, although I've had it used on me.  After extensive RTFM, I used it several times over two days, and I frequently got weirdly low measurements. Diastolic was mostly between 50 and 60, but a few times, I saw the display drop to 30, then turn off and give an error. Right now, half an hour after the medicine, diastolic was 63, but systolic was only 90.  Seeing that I usually have a BP in the middle of the healthy range (when measured by somebody who presumably knows what he's doing), and I don't feel close to fainting, I assume that I'm doing something wrong when measuring. I tried doing everything right - sitting straight in a chair, cuff on the naked left arm at heart height, not moving for a while. What are the possible error sources left?

Recently, I had something on my leg that Polysporin was not helping - after a week of twice daily Polysporin I got out the Dr Chase and in two days it was better. It is a matter of family legend that it must contain radiation or mercury or something because it is just not like any other ointment.  As far as I know, it's not made any more. I would love to replace my tin and use it more often, but I haven't been able to find it. However, I can read the back of the tin just fine and it consists of: Zinc Oxide suspensions are easy to find (diaper cream) but they don't have phenol in them. I have turned up a Canadian ointment (how convenient, I am in Canada) called Ozonol that contains 0.18% phenol and 3.72% zinc oxide. How likely is this to be as good? The Dr Chase is a tiny little tin, 2" across, and you use very little at a time of this very thick ointment - it's just like diaper cream. The Ozonal comes in a tube.

This is usually not in large quantities, although a recent story in the local newspaper did report the death of a three-year-old by alcohol poisoning for consuming about 100ml in a short period of time. (This would be without water, as shots, and possibly on an empty stomach, per the local custom.) Everyone knows that  , but I'd like to quantify this a bit if possible. Assume a healthy two-year-old child who weighs about 25 pounds; how much hard liquor would be unhealthy and why? I'm looking for an answer that isn't   for the sake of being zero (unless there's a true reason that   is damaging). Kids often taste it off the end of a chopstick or something similar, so dosages of <1ml in an evening may be realistic in the common case, a couple of times per month. In other cases, a child will be able to drink from the glass, and once at a wedding I've seen a three-year-old nephew-in-law drunk as a result. His dad is undoubtedly giving him too much, but too much by how much?  is the closest related answer I found on this site. The research cited suggests that even a short period of time with high exposure is damaging (which is obvious), but not really the minimum dosage for damage.   posit that a little alcohol each day is healthy, suggesting a threshold effect is in place. Does the threshold also exist for children with developing brains, given alcohol quantities proportional to body weight and likely a coefficient related to mental development stage?  is the closest related question I found on a web search. The Question was " "; the Answer immediately sidesteps the question, asserts that 60ml is a small quantity, and then concludes by explaining that 60ml is not a small quantity. The correct answer may be that the truth is intractable, similar to  , but the situation here is different. I'm not seeing multiple conflicting studies; rather, I'm seeing very little research on this topic. My guesstimate, based on absolute air, is that it's somewhere in the vicinity of 5ml, but I'm hoping there's some real relevant research out there given how important the issue and how absolutely prevalent of a practice it is.  For the purposes of this Question, I'm only interested in direct health effects and long-term damage, and not second-order effects like increasing propensity for alcoholism. I'm really trying to understand how much physical machinery a two-year-old child has when it comes to processing alcohol, such that a few hours later they'd be just fine in the same way an adult is just fine after drinking a small amount of liquor. Do the necessary enzymes exist at all in small children? If so, how much liquor would the child be able to process? (If not, what happened to the ~10ml that the child in my example consumed? What sort of damage did it cause?)-	2017-04-14 18:16:40Z	Pills N Pillows	9	2	lasting-effects-duration, alcohol, pediatrics, enzyme, toddler

1189	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1189/reducing-trauma-from-surgery-prohibiting-sedation	Reducing trauma from surgery prohibiting sedation	I've noticed something a bit worrying about the way certain surgeries are performed, and I was wondering if there is a better way: During surgery, medications are administered to induce unconsciousness, analgesia, amnesia and paralysis. Each of these has a role: unconsciousness as most people would be more than a little uncomfortable seeing their organs in living color, analgesia as the pain of being operated on can be quite significant, amnesia to prevent later trauma, and paralysis so the patient holds still. I've noticed that while analgesia and paralysis can be independently controlled, anterograde amnesia tends to be more of a happy side effect of medications that induce unconsciousness and analgesia. This can be a problem with surgeries that require consciousness, such as many involving the brain or the spinal cord, or performed on pregnant women, as without severely impairing brain function there is no good way of inducing amnesia for the duration of the surgery. Hence it would seem a number of patients have traumatic memories of their brains being probed on the operating table. In short, is there a way of inducing anterograde amnesia without the mental "fog" for trauma reduction in surgery?-	2015-06-08 14:43:10Z	TheEnvironmentalist	1	0	surgery, brain, anaesthesia

Today, in my high school health class we were learning about HIV and AIDS, and I was wondering what would happen to HIV if it killed off all of the cells that it uses to reproduce. For example, imagine this hypothetical scenario: A patient with HIV goes to a doctor who puts them in a sterile environment and gives them every medicine necessary to protect them from other diseases that might be lurking in their body (to protect them from common illnesses that could become deadly without an immune system, like the common cold). While they are in this sterile environment, they allow the HIV virus to attack all of the immune system cells, until eventually they are all destroyed.  So my question is: If all the immune system cells are dead and the virus can't take them over, would the virus just "die" out, effectively curing the patient?-	2016-01-02 09:38:16Z	YviDe	10	1	immune-system, virology, hiv

I take a number of different medications and herbal supplements. Because keeping separate containers in my pocketbook is cumbersome, I've been combining them together in the same prescription bottle. I'm wondering if this alters or diminishes their effectiveness.  The combination includes: regular tablets, some of which have been cut in half; coated tablets; and capsules. The capsules are clear, made of plant-based hypromellose, and are filled with either powdered medication or ground herbs. There are no gel-caps or anything containing liquid.  There's usually some fine powder in the bottom of the bottle, which I assume comes from the broken pills. Other than that, everything appears intact and not misshapen, stuck together, or otherwise compromised.  Is there an overarching rule of thumb for this situation, or would it depend on the specific medications? -	2015-06-17 20:01:12Z	Sue	11	1	medications

I'm 23 years old lanky guy, and my health is below average. I believe it's also wise to mention that I currently have Tuberculosis in my lymph nodes around the neck area, for which I'm taking my medications. My past health issues were typhoid and recently pneumonia (February 2014).   With that being said, I'm currently working two jobs out of necessity. First starting from 1pm till 10pm, and another starting from 11pm till 5am. So my routine is work from 1pm till 5am, and reach home by 6am and sleep till 12 noon, get ready and the cycle continues. This happens 5 days a week, and I get a full two days of rest.   Now I've recently thought about taking a leave on my night job (11pm - 5am) every Wednesday, such that I'll get to have a good rest in the interval of 2 days (I hope you understand the pattern). By first thoughts, this feels like a good enough decision.   But my concern is that I may worsen my health even more. I think I read somewhere that random changes on one's routine can confuse the body which will lead to serious health issues, and since this new routine is pretty random, I fear that I may fall sick all of a sudden, something that I cannot afford financially and health-wise too.   So should I go ahead and follow this new routine? I know there aren't many options that I can choose from, but is there better routine that could follow?-	2017-01-25 09:32:31Z	Butterfly and Bones	8	2	sleep, lymph-nodes

1080	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1080/help-identifying-possible-workplace-contaminants	Help identifying possible workplace contaminants	A family member of mine works in a call center, and has been experiencing several symptoms whenever at work: The list may be nonexhaustive, but these are the most prominent ones. The symptoms vary in severity, causing rather discomfort than cause for acute concern. She is not the only one experiencing these symptoms; in fact several employees have been moved to other locations due to similar symptoms while in this particular building, and even statistically there has been a minor increase in outbreaks of asthma among the employees. Samples have been taken from the air and the linoleum floor, and those have not shown any signs of bacteria, fungi or other volatile organic compounds including 2-ethylhexanol. Yet the symptoms continue, and the only possible explanations offered so far have been insufficient ventilation and psychosomatic causes. I found these explanations lacking however, since so far I haven't found evidence to suggest they could cause rashes that have been appearing symmetrically on the forearms. Also some (but not all) employees transferred to other locations stop experiencing symptoms. The symmetric appearance of the rashes could be an indication that the cause could, for example, be a cleaning agent used on the tables, but then again people working for the same employer in an adjacent building don't suffer from the same symptoms. I have no knowledge of whether the rashes are identical among all symptomatic employees or not. The buildings are not identical in layout, ventilation, or otherwise, but are cleaned by the same company. In my opinion the circumstances point to an airborne agent that is yet to be identified, however as I mentioned, the tests done so far have come back negative. I'm looking for ideas on what could be the cause of such symptoms. Some more points to take into consideration: Workplace safety administration has been notified of the problems, and they ordered samples to be taken. As I mentioned above, the tested samples didn't show anything remarkable. At this point the employer also transferred all symptomatic employees to the adjacent building, which combined with the test results satisfied the officials and the case was closed. The employer has since started refusing transfer requests, and also actively refused when the employees suggested that they could hire a detection dog trained for mold at their own expense. Unfortunately there are no other gov't departments that could be involved in the matter in any sensible amount of time unless there is something concrete (no pun intended) to show that the previous tests were not enough (  that there is some foul play involved). To sum things up, I'm not an expert on the subject, and was hoping to get some suggestions on what could cause the described symptoms. Having concrete suggestions would greatly help getting investigations started again.-	2015-06-01 14:55:59Z	Schlaus	1	0	chemical, mold

1064	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1064/do-vitamins-affect-sense-of-taste	Do vitamins affect sense of taste?	I like oranges. I   like oranges. But I go through cycles of eating them. When I start, they are   sweet. By my fifth of the day they have turned quite bitter. Sensing a pattern I have performed an experiment. The theory is that the more vitamin C I eat, the less I want foods that contain vitamin C. So, I stopped eating oranges for a month. I had one orange and it was really sweet - which validates the inverse of my theory (the less vitamin C I eat the more I want foods that contain it). I then started taking vitamin C tablets for a week and had an orange, and it was bitter. To make sure it wasn't just a bitter orange I asked a friend to share it with me (without explaining why I wanted to share the orange with him). He said it was very sweet and enjoyed it loads. I have been unable to locate studies or anecdotes regarding this sort of thing. So, my question: Do our bodies alter our taste buds based on what we eat in order to maintain a stable balance of nutrients, vitamins, etc? (by encouraging/discouraging us to eat food x because we need/don't need the nutrients/vitamins/etc)? I have previously noticed a similar alteration in sense of taste for spinach for a little while.

1058	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/1058/what-factors-affect-exercise-induced-nausea	What factors affect exercise induced nausea?	I know a few people who would vomit after or during training (various running exercises). My trainer said it was due to the lactate level in the blood, though I can't find a source to corroborate this. According to the reference from   the duration of exercise and intensity (aerobic vs anaerobic) and prior food or drink consumption are the main factors contributing to this effect. I gather it is not a very common phenomenon. It seems like a basic reflex to get rid of food so the muscles and/or brain can get more blood. So is a high lactate level and a non-empty stomach all there is to this? If so I think it would be more common. I'm guessing there is a psychological element too? Can anyone explain the triggers/causes better? Edit: Consider the following scenario: a group of 30 people of a similar age perform intensive exercise. 2 people feel really nauseous afterwards. Assuming that hydration is not a cause, what mechanism(s) explain(s) why these people feel sicker? I think assuming that only pH is a factor is flawed. The wikipedia article I mentioned   states that food intake affects nausea. I can also corroborate this with experiences of many of the people (friends/family) I asked. The article also states that nausea is a consequence of bloodflow to the stomach/gut being restricted (implying the pH recepter does not directly induce nausea). So I'm guessing this flow restriction follows from the pH mechanism in the brain?  By piecing together this info I then get this order of events:   1 - Exercise reduces pH   2 - Brain pH receptor reduces blood flow to stomach   3 - Stomach receptors trigger nausea when blood flow is low (stronger signal if stomach is fuller)   This theory seems to cover both claims of pH (in the answer below) and food intake (in the wiki article). But it is just conjecture on my part.  I could imagine a 4th step where a person has less nausea if they produce more endorfins during exercise, or more when they have a psycological tendency to throw up whenever nauseous.  Or maybe I'm wrong about pH affecting blood flow to the stomach. So, barring hydration-related causes, is it just blood pH and stomach contents that determine the nausea felt after some forms of exercise?  And if pH is a factor (as stated by an answer), how much does sensitivity depend on 1)their fitness/condition to counter the pH decrease and 2)  their physical response to a low pH--e.g. maybe a genetic factor makes some people more sensitive?-	2015-11-24 07:35:30Z	YviDe	3	0	exercise, nausea

So the question is, does it work the other way too? The basic scenario I'm asking about is if one were to go from a lifestyle of plenty of exercise, and a high-calorie diet to compensate (if you need more detail, say the diet consists of plenty of proteins, decent fats, relatively-low carbs, so quite healthy) to a lifestyle of no exercise, half the calories, much more carbs, much less protein. Current evidence seems to indicate this would cause a significant drop in metabolism. So what about the inverse scenario? Say after six months, our subject adds back the exercise, and doubles calorie consumption by switching back to a diet of plenty of proteins, decent fats, and relatively-low carbs. Say this change takes place over a single week, and remains afterward. : I realize "metabolism" is non-technical shorthand for the convergence of thousands of chemical processes used by the body to essentially process energy, and that the changes above would result in complex chains of changes that can't be exactly predicted.

Sex therapy (including  ) is a treatment option for   issues - when there are problems and goals pertaining to sex itself. Sexual health tends to be studied from the angle of being on the 'receiving' end of health, merely being 'improved' as a benefit of good health, or hampered as a result of bad health. But I wonder whether there have been examples of, any research on, or plausible basis for, sex (whether just orgasm as the common denominator, specific sexual techniques similar to Tantra, and whether solo or with a partner) being a 'medical treatment' mechanism for anything  -sexual in nature also. In other words, considering the opposite - sex helping to not only improve health itself - but actually be a legitimate and studied   of (alternative) medical treatment for a whole range of scenarios whose goals have nothing to do with sex. I have no collated research to offer up-front in the question, but only one particular angle of inquiry of my own, which is that sexual activity is part of the   and that, given the involuntary and powerful nature of sexual function, perhaps it might assist in nervous system balance/repair/damage/even issues with PTSD/fight-or-flight sympathetic nervous system issues (e.g. maybe it is the strongest way to activate and train the parasympathetic system where a patient has issues relating to it), if studied. There are many studies that show sex (and especially intimate sexual activity with a partner) has many direct health benefits, proven mechanisms to relieve mental stress and certainly regulate hormones of the endocrine system which then has further beneficial domino effects itself. But is there basis to suspect it could do more? (Similar to well-understood exercise and body movement therapies having massive positive and thus often healing effects on the body?) Has this been studied at all? Obviously in our current society the principal reason for a lack of such study would be the cultural and 'moral' taboos associated with this idea - sex always being an end, but hardly ever a means.-	2016-11-11 14:37:47Z	Butterfly and Bones	16	2	treatment-options, benefits, endorphins, sex-therapy

I do not get any exercise beyond regular commuting/housework. This means I do not go to the gym, or jog or explicitly work out in any way, though I do bike small distances to commute. Ive been to a few health talks, and they have always suggested that with my lifestyle, I should be gaining a lot of weight. However, I am not only not gaining weight, but actually losing weight at a slow pace over the last few years. My BMI is close to perfect. I live a normal life, apart from the fact that I tire easily. This is the reason I dont exercise. I once attended a yoga class where the instructor claimed that after some light yoga in the morning, participants would feel energized all day. Whereas other participants reported that this was indeed the case with them, I would go home and need to sleep (presumably from exhaustion). From childhood, I have always been described by friends and family as having a weak constitution. However, I stress that as long as I dont explicitly exercise, I function perfectly normally, and probably come across as a generally energetic individual, though I still seem to need more sleep than average (8.5 to 10 hours). I do not have any medical problems at all (assuming that weak constitution does not qualify as a disease or medical condition). Why is it that I can eat fattening foods, not exercise, and yet not put on weight? I have been told that this is due to a high metabolic rate.

About a year and a half ago, I was rear-ended pretty hard.  The car was totaled, and I sustained minor injuries on the left side of my body where the impact threw me against the driver's-side door. I had no back or neck pain, but I did have bad pain for nearly two weeks in my shoulder, hips, and legs.  After the pain went away, I was, for all intents and purposes, fine. As of the past two weeks, however, I've been feeling the same type of numbness and tingling in my leg that one would feel after their leg had fallen asleep. I have no back pain and no weakness.  The numbness and tingling is almost always there (it doesn't come and go), starting about 7 inches above my right knee and all the way down to just above my ankle on the outside (not the inside) of my leg. It becomes very mild to the point where I'll forget about it if I'm distracted, but, if I stop to think about it, sure enough, it's there. I will also note that I purchased a standing treadmill desk early January of this year and have been standing for six hours a day after work during the week and all day long during the weekend.  I'd attribute the numbness and tingling my constant standing if it weren't for the facts that 1) it's only started to happen only recently and 2) I feel it in the morning when I wake up and at work while I am sitting down. Is it possible that my accident resulted in a lower back injury that is only now starting to cause symptoms to emerge?-	2017-04-27 04:34:59Z	Pills N Pillows	5	1	injury, numbness, tingling

656	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/656/long-term-effects-of-lens-removal-as-the-vitreous-ages	Long-term effects of lens removal as the vitreous ages?	In a case of pediatric cataract surgery where the lens was not replaced, there is no lens to serve as a barrier between the aqueous and the vitreous.  I once asked an ophthalmologist what keeps them from mixing together in that case -- are they of different viscosities, like oil and water, for instance?  She said it's something like that, but that with aging the vitreous gradually thins (causing floaters, among things) and they end up blending together.  She said this isn't really a problem in practice, as each humour's main function is to deliver nutrients to the right parts of the eye and they can still do that. I understand that the aqueous drains through a duct, so that part isn't a closed system.  But the vitreous usually is a closed system, as I understand it, which is why floaters don't go away.  A remedy for floaters that is sometimes brought up is  , but that carries risk of retinal detachment (according to Wikipedia, and I think I remember hearing that from an ophthalmologist too). Putting all of these together, it seems possible that with aging, as the vitreous becomes less distinct from the aqueous, some of the vitreous might end up draining through the same duct that the aqueous drains through, in an eye with no lens to serve as a barrier.  Is that the case?  And if it is, does it carry with it a higher risk of the things that can go wrong with vitrectomy (especially retinal detachment)?  Or does the risk that comes with that procedure not arise with a slow, gradual aging process? Update: I've seen a reference to the  , which, in addition to the lens, sits between the vitreous and aqueous.

When I was a child, I was diagnosed with spine deformations: scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis. The scoliosis is the most pronounced one in my case.  The professionals (I don't remember if it was the doctor or the rehabilitator who led my medicinal gymnastics classes) told us that it is connected to the bed I sleep in, and advised that I start sleeping on a firm mattress. I don't know exactly if they suggested that a soft mattress causes the deformation to start, or if it only exacerbates it once it has started. And indeed, in my childhood, I was sleeping on an old metal-springs bed which was quite sagging.  The advice has an obvious logic to it, but in the meantime, I've learned that many of the obvious things in medicine just ain't so.

This health reason is the one that makes me ask a question here: I have the impression that DIYing liquid is actually unsafe.

I have heard that if you are in the wilderness and need a sterile fluid to rinse a wound, urine is an acceptable choice.  Sometime ago this topic came up while discussing emergency treatment.  It was suggested that as urine is a sterile fluid it would be a good choice for rinsing an open wound.   Where good means less likely for an infection to set in as if it would if the wound was not rinsed OR if the wound was rinsed with ground or another non-sterile water source.

Neither offered any actual evidence. The specialist gave a rather strange reason, which now escapes me. This idea has inherent plausibility, because eating a lot of sugar could be assumed to stress the  body mechanisms that keep sugar level in the blood under control. Too much stress could cause these mechanisms to break down. This is, however, not the reason the specialist gave. A confounding factor could be that eating too much sugar might cause weight gain, which might increase the risk of diabetes for different reasons. There are (at least) two kinds of answers that would be useful here. The term "too much", of course, is ill-defined.

Our daughter was diagnosed with   (WPW) at zero weeks age in April 2014. I found a very interesting  . It can be summarized as: Since the study is 25 years old, I was wondering whether or not there are newer studies that better results (especially how the recurrence for patients given drugs compares to those without drugs). Are there any recent studies about the long term development/evolution of WPW in toddlers/kids/young adults?-	2015-04-03 00:23:48Z	michaelpri	9	1	clinical-study, wpw-syndrome
16	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/16/dietary-factors-for-calcium-oxalate-kidney-stones	Dietary Factors for Calcium Oxalate Kidney Stones	Is there any evidence that diet factors play a big role in the creation of calcium oxalate kidney stones? Some doctors and other sources recommend cutting out coffee, tea, soft drinks, and dietary calcium to reduce the risk of stones. Other sources seem to recommend cutting out dietary items that increase oxalate levels. It seems that scientists have a good understanding of how kidneys function, yet there doesn't seem to be a consensus for dietary recommendations for these types of stones. The most obvious answer would seem to be water consumption. The less water one consumes, the less dilute the urine in the kidney becomes.-	2015-04-06 02:12:20Z	michaelpri	10	0	renal, urology, kidney-stones

According to   on eye floaters: Even if this might be the case for very small floaters, what about larger ones that cannot be "hidden" from our vision (but that might be moved away from the point we're looking at)? Will they remain visible or could they disappear with time? I couldn't find credible sources or agreement on their fate.-	2017-03-13 04:40:57Z	Pills N Pillows	16	4	eye, ophthalmology, aging

It's been argued by various medical organizations that male circumcision has various medical benefits, such as reducing the risk of catching HIV, or reducing the risk of urinary tract infections, for instance.

My teenage cousin doesn't suffer from any problems due to Calcium deficiency or that need Calcium supplementation. He's lactose-intolerant.    states that he needs 1000 mg of Calcium daily but it fails to address the impracticality of satisfying RDA from eating only  natural foods. Given his fear, he'll keep any consumption of Calcium supplements far below the maximum dosage. Then are Calcium supplements safe to consume?  Conflicting answers from different doctors (whom he consulted) worsen his confusion. Some recommend Calcium supplements, but others reject them.

While playing indoor soccer a couple days ago, I was fouled and fell forwards so that my hand skidded across the court a bit. It left the blister as you see in the image here: What should I consider when deciding to remove this blister? I could open and drain this blister, removing the excess skin afterwards, or leave it as is. I figure since it's in a place that is likely to be touched/disrupted I should remove it since it's likely to open anyways.-	2015-04-13 04:27:47Z	Zaralynda	21	0	wound, removal
5	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/5/can-the-immune-system-break-down-anything	Can the immune system break down anything?	Every time one takes a pill, drinks a glass of wine, or uses an illicit drug, it is understood that the effects are temporary. Caffeine only keeps one awake for a few hours, alcohol only intoxicates for a few hours, aspirin only staves off a headache for a few hours. This is because the immune system breaks medicines down, and when they're entirely gone, so is the effect. So can the body break down anything? The assumption is that the body remains alive long enough to finish breaking down (or not breaking down) the substance.-	2015-04-08 18:37:28Z	kenorb	14	1	immune-system, drug-metabolism
4	https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4/if-human-life-is-so-long-largely-due-to-modern-medicine-does-every-illness-shor	If human life is so long largely due to modern medicine, does every illness shorten lifespan?	One of the most often-cited facts about human life, compared to those of other animals, is that the main reason we live so much longer is modern medicine. Because we can treat illnesses that would previously affect lifespan, we are far more likely to live greatly extended lifespans. However, this leads to two possible (conflicting) logical conclusions: If the first is true, then lifespan itself isn't influenced by modern medicine unless it prevents death as the direct result of a disease, and only   lifespan is affected. In other words, if nine in ten dies at age thirty due to a deadly disease, and one in ten dies at age eighty by avoiding disease, the average life expectancy is thirty five, even though an individual could by living an extremely careful life survive to reach eighty. If the second is true, then short periods of non-deadly illnesses experienced by everyone each shorten life expectancy by a tiny amount, together decreasing   lifespan to the same thirty five, rather than the effect being a result of averages.-	2015-03-31 19:11:24Z	TheEnvironmentalist	28	0	life-expectancy, disease, statistics
