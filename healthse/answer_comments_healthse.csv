15453	15455	No nutrition analysis.  No specific cost analysis.	2018-02-28 23:39:15Z	Paparazzi
15453	15455	It doesn't need a cost analysis. As you've shown, if you don't buy eggs, yogurt, and perishable veggies like peppers, you can eat for under $5 a day.  Whether it's $4.57 or $3.93 really isn't relevant.	2018-02-28 23:55:20Z	Kate Gregory
15453	15455	One thing that puzzles me a bit: why the emphasis on the fridge? Cheese is a way to make milk kep for very long, well most types are, Shopping evey day on the way home or 2–3 times a week is also excluded? Food desert presumed? Buy raw & stay cheap., OK. But where are the potatoes? – That budget calculation: how can that include any supplements? Those are usually quite over the top in price and are a sign of bad diet, if they are "necessary".	2018-03-01 00:34:30Z	LangLangC
15453	15455	@KateGregory Yes I have shown price not you and it posted after this answer.  You have not shown a healthy diet for less than $5 a day. Again no  specific nutritional analysis.	2018-03-01 00:55:06Z	Paparazzi
15453	15455	Hm. Comments are meant to improve the post, not attack each other. – I do read: "and again you won't eat anywhere near a pound of dried beans per serving". – Limiting protein for whatever reason, to "80g" is only reasonable for quite slim and short, or ill, persons. If I'm mistaken on that, a reference might convince me otherwise.	2018-03-01 01:17:48Z	LangLangC
15453	15471	without refrigeration, where is the egg kept? OK, some Europeans keep eggs on the counter, but the yogurt? Also, this is a really strange "meal" -- I can't see how the ingredients add up to a single dish (eg salad, stew) or even two or three such dishes.	2018-02-28 23:32:39Z	Kate Gregory
15453	15471	@KateGregory An egg will keep days.  You can eat yogurt the day you shop.  OP did not ask for preparation or meal.   This is simply an analysis of getting to nutritional numbers with cost -  something your answer does not provide.  Where is any meal or nutrition in your answer?  Where is any actual cost analysis in your answer?	2018-02-28 23:38:35Z	Paparazzi
15453	15471	+ for you: An egg can be kept for 2–3 weeks, longer if in the fridge. Bulk pricing doesn't exclude shopping locally every day. We do not know where and when this diet is to be employed, how long a yoghurt keeps is also a few days if Northern hemisphere right now: longer. – The neg: the preparation has to be considered. Dishes seem indeed quite… "fashionable?" Of course you can survive on your list, eating that stuff in separation, for a while. Where are the potatoes, vitamins, minerals in this? I guess this list is too low on fat, despite suggesting 2 oz of olive oil! (How to get that down?)	2018-03-01 00:27:10Z	LangLangC
15453	15471	"For an active lifestyle" and significantly less than 2000 kcal will result in quite a slender and frustrated person.	2018-03-01 00:28:49Z	LangLangC
15453	15471	My suggestion was not "it's wrong", solely to maybe include vitamins and minerals into your analysis. That analysis is the strong point of your A. Currently (I estimate only) your list falls a bit on the short for my taste on methionie, protein in general, kcals, D, and Ca (I really haven't calc'd it).  & for my genetics, build and lifestyle: not enough. – Qs can be less than ideal. If an A hilites shortcomings, why not? We are coctivores. Given your list I just wonder how to down 2oz of oil? The rest I would eat raw and isolated without hesitation. (In fact, I believe I did for a time ;) )	2018-03-01 02:08:38Z	LangLangC
15452	15466	But if this happens for example in the shower accidently with a strong water jet for a very short time, how loud would it be for the ear (decibels) approximately and could the acoustic reflex protect the ear enough? I don't mean physical damage to the ear drum (which could possible appear because of the pressure), I'm just referring to inner damage (stereocilia damage).	2018-02-28 10:37:34Z	
15452	15466	That's an interesting but different question prompting calculations of underwater acoustic physics.  I speculate that the angle of the canal would have less of a dampening effect on the force of sound than on the flow of water in a jet..	2018-02-28 12:48:18Z	DoctorWhom
15452	15466	Ok thank you. But how can I calculate a sound pressure, when the sound is generated directly on the tympanic membrane? I know a sound pressure formula where you can calculate the sound pressure for a certain distance. But here, the distance should be zero. I don't know how to calculate that. Do you have any suggestions or estimations about that?	2018-02-28 14:29:33Z	
15432	15435	Sorry but you'll need to provide a link for non obvious answers.	2018-02-26 17:56:50Z	Graham Chiu
15419	15420	Welcome to Health! Can you be more specific, for example which questionnaire you had in mind, and how to address the burnout itself? Thanks!	2018-02-24 15:40:54Z	bertieb
15395	15397	Thank, this gives me something to work with. He assumes the odd cigar smoking is OK because he seems to think they're less harmful than cigarettes. I don't want him to smoke anything but it sounds like he has it backwards. Obviously I don't want him to smoke anything but if he is going to do it, I want him to be aware that cigars are NOT a green light and if anything more worse than cigarettes! I tried to tell him this. Also, he inhales his cigars.	2018-02-21 06:29:17Z	
15395	15397	An "odd cigar" is different than daily - a weekly cigar would be less harmful than a pack of cigarettes a day, it's a dose-dependent (quantity) harm.  But puff for puff, cigars pack a worse punch.  Basically he shouldn't feel okay with it either way.  If you're looking for actual harm reduction, vaping seems to not be as harmful as either of them. I'm of the school of thought that feels harm reduction is better than nothing.	2018-02-21 09:41:31Z	DoctorWhom
15395	15397	Doesn't inhalation depth also factor into it? Generally (but not in the OP's case apparantly), you don't inhale cigars as deeply as cigarettes.	2018-02-22 00:15:32Z	AytAyt
15395	15397	It touches on that in the articles, where in cigars people hold the smoke in their mouths mostly, but there are still lots of known harms with that.	2018-02-22 01:18:30Z	DoctorWhom
15389	15392	Professional credentials aren't required here, but supporting references are.  Please add links to sources that support your main factual claims.	2018-02-20 18:01:37Z	Carey Gregory
15384	15385	This is ridiculous. Two good answers here, ahem, sorry, almost non-explaining stubs at CV. +1.	2018-02-20 17:42:23Z	LangLangC
15356	15368	Is there a solution for teenagers who regularly sleep in really late resulting in short photoperiods?	2018-02-18 23:25:14Z	Graham Chiu
15356	15368	Solution as in a "normalized" melatonin schedule? Some people take melatonin, but I've heard a person can build tolerance to it. Exercise seems to be the general consensus of experts in the area of sleep. I suppose this is the problem you're talking about: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2820578	2018-02-18 23:56:08Z	Dave Liu
15356	15368	Yes, a way to fix that!	2018-02-19 00:39:26Z	Graham Chiu
15346	15347	Nice. Two prelim criticisms: When/for what is CBT not the first or even a good choice (more emphasis) / Side-effects just for CBT. For PA e.g. those are/might be numerous and well documented!	2018-02-16 22:26:04Z	LangLangC
15346	15347	Good point. I'll add that CBT's not for replacing serious chemical imbalances, which put a person at imeediate risk. That was careless of me not to add more about side effects.	2018-02-17 23:23:28Z	
15339	15340	However, removal of tonsil stones is a procedure performed by ENTs. A web search also reveals that home tonsil stone removal is very common and there are even devices sold for that purpose. People also use Waterpiks to flush them out. Seems to be pretty much the same as the tonsil washing OP described.	2018-02-15 18:34:23Z	Carey Gregory
15339	15340	Yes, I was aware of that but the q is about tonsillitis.	2018-02-15 21:02:49Z	Graham Chiu
15339	15340	There is known correlation between tonsilloliths and tonsillitis. Keep in mind that -itis isn't just infection, it's inflammation.  However I do not know i fhte evidence is convincing whether removing stones prevents inflammation/infection.  But anecdotally I have cryptic tonsils myself and own a device ENT recommended for symptomatic stones - though gargling in the shower works just as well IMHO.	2018-02-16 00:34:57Z	DoctorWhom
15339	15340	One last question - would irrigation of tonsillar lacunae be the most appropriate English-language term for this procedure, in case I'd want to translate the Wikipedia article into English?	2018-02-17 10:04:36Z	
15336	15343	Great answer except I think your first paragraph needs a supporting reference.	2018-02-16 02:12:34Z	Carey Gregory
15336	15343	Not my answer. Tell us how you know this.	2018-02-16 04:57:41Z	Carey Gregory
15336	15343	Easiest way to sterilize the gut is to give birth to a baby ... Gut is sterile at birth.	2018-02-16 12:32:58Z	Graham Chiu
15336	15343	@CareyGregory - There is no such study. Surgeons preparing the gut for surgery are the most concerned with the possibility of abdominal infection on opening the intestines in vivo. The studies assess various methods for which is superior and which is dangerous, etc. Not for which is 100% effective.	2018-02-16 16:03:13Z	anongoodnurse
15336	15343	That first paragraph seems so obvious on the face of it that I'm not sure it really needs references. But then I guess it depends on what you mean by "sterilize." If you mean 100% free of foreign microbes, then I don't see the need for references. If you mean, say, 99.90% fewer microbes than before treatment, then maybe references are in order.	2018-02-16 20:01:56Z	BillDOe
15336	15337	That won't sterilize the gut	2018-02-14 21:46:13Z	Graham Chiu
15336	15337	@GrahamChiu Antibiotics have to be administered during this treatment, I've added that in the text.	2018-02-14 22:38:53Z	Count Iblis
15336	15337	A link to support your factual claims regarding how it's done would be expected. C'mon, you know that.	2018-02-15 02:01:53Z	Carey Gregory
15336	15337	You also normally use non absorbable antibiotics when performing gut sterilisation clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03157388	2018-02-15 02:17:49Z	Graham Chiu
15336	15337	@GrahamChiu Thank you for posting that link. That's a very interesting study.	2018-02-16 11:44:19Z	cloudnyn3

15335	15341	Most paywalls have been breached, and as pointed out here, subscription journals are doomed.	2018-02-17 18:53:33Z	Count Iblis
15335	15341	@CountIblis That is in way true. But it is even more effective to condemn the publishers to damnatio memoriae and not cite from them, if possible. A middle ground might be reached by using unpaywall. That is also less legally troubled. Jurisdictions differ, some of these services you mentioned might be or will be blocked, get or taken down etc.	2018-02-18 01:29:49Z	LangLangC
15320	15321	@DoctorWhom - good edit, thanks! I had intended the initial heading to be the general (non-personal) form of the question posed by OP; your phrasing makes it read much better though! Cheers	2018-02-12 23:56:50Z	bertieb
15316	15323	You might have a good answer here but you make a lot of assertions of fact with no supporting sources. For example, you state that porn withdrawal is equivalent to dopamine withdrawal. Oh, says who? And your list of symptoms of porn withdrawal -- where did that come from? For all we know you just made it up. Please add citations supporting your  factual claims or you risk having your answer downvoted and/or closed.	2018-02-14 02:10:48Z	Carey Gregory
15316	15323	I agree, this seems feasible but resources are needed	2018-02-14 02:21:13Z	DoctorWhom
15303	15306	Citations......	2018-02-12 05:47:24Z	Carey Gregory
15287	15288	Providing or looking for information on what "can" help when you have no ability to effectively diagnose the problem can be dangerous.  How do you know the problem is CPPS and not any other kind of Prostatitis?  Giving medical advice is frowned upon here for safety reasons	2018-02-10 11:21:21Z	Chris
15287	15288	If you wish to provide a general answer without risk of giving what can be considered medical advice, I would just stick to the side effects risks just as you have, although again this can differ from person to person.  How medication works and what treatment paths may be required should be left to the OPs doctor who has the ability to effectively diagnose the problem and give the correct advice.  Giving something which might help could exacerbate the problem, and in extreme cases with some medical conditions it could lead to death.	2018-02-10 11:35:58Z	Chris
15287	15288	I have removed that section. If you have any further suggestions or feel it could be improved further, please let me know.	2018-02-10 11:42:32Z	bertieb
15280	15285	Most excellent.	2018-02-09 20:08:44Z	LangLangC
15280	15285	I think you need to state that there is no high quality level one data to support the use of radon in rheumatoid arthritis.	2018-02-10 17:43:51Z	Graham Chiu
15280	15285	@GrahamChiu Interesting suggestion; do you reckon that is clearer than "but there is not good or widespread evidence for this" in the tl;dr section at the start? I think they both amount to saying the same thing, but wanted to keep the initial section slightly more layman friendly as that's what they'll see first. I could add that as a concluding sentence perhaps? Happy to hear your thoughts	2018-02-10 18:27:45Z	bertieb
15280	15285	Why have a summary that talks of potential but unproven benefit? It's best to steer patients away from at best placebo treatment. The data available is not going to meet any modern criteria for effectiveness.	2018-02-11 00:30:39Z	Graham Chiu
15280	15285	Welcome back bertieb!  Thank you for the great answer and wealth of research incorporated.  You did a great job of editing it per GrahamChiu's suggestions, which I agree with.  We're thrilled to have more medical professionals/students involved in the site!  I look forward to having you into the voting ranks when your rep hits 1000.	2018-02-11 11:37:59Z	DoctorWhom
15277	15279	Interesting, I didn't know enamel could regenerate. I though once you lost some of it, it'd be lost forever.	2018-02-09 17:17:12Z	
15277	15279	Only very small lesions may be healed. Obvious caries is still considered permanent.	2018-02-09 17:59:39Z	Jan
15277	15279	Every meal and contact with acids demineralises teeth, not only caries. Lesions in this sense would include the invisible day to day occurences.  So that's a constant process. It seems a common misconception that remineralisation might refill cavities, regardless of size. That's also a prob with your excerpt: incidence of caries is reduced, not existing reversed? Can you clarify that?	2018-02-09 19:39:30Z	LangLangC
15277	15279	@LangLangC Sometimes pain in your teeth comes and goes, that is much too subjective of an observation to say cavities can be healed, but it might do so to some height? Or is that nonsense?	2018-02-09 23:12:11Z	
15277	15279	@Bart Misunderstanding? I meant remin is going on, always, in enamel and dentin. Extraordinarily important, but that is also microscopic and below. And also important for sensitive teeth. But people often mistake remin for filling large macro-structural holes (often from caries), which is (currently?) impossible with tools at our disposal.	2018-02-09 23:17:50Z	LangLangC
15270	15278	Since glycogen is stored as intracellular granules, and muscle cell numbers don't increase, what governs the amount stored in the muscle cell?	2018-02-09 10:32:05Z	Graham Chiu
15270	15278	Exercise increases insulin sensitivity (I added another quote in my answer).	2018-02-09 10:56:51Z	Jan
15266	15272	That's my thought as well and the cremasteric contraction is listed on some sites as part of the flight response. Interestingly his response is flight as per comments. Habituation might be why it's no longer happening.	2018-02-08 22:35:10Z	Graham Chiu
15266	15272	Yeah that was my thought as well re: habituation. Interesting stuff	2018-02-09 01:09:30Z	Nate
15249	15254	Omega-3's benefit is more that the typical Westerner has out of wack omega-3 : omega-6 ratios, and consuming more omega-3 reduces systemic inflammation.	2018-02-07 15:46:19Z	WakeDemons3
15249	15254	The importance of low omega-6/omega-3 ratio has been questioned recently: hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/omega-3-fats	2018-02-07 16:19:55Z	Jan
15241	15248	Do you mean oral antibiotics only?  Or are you talking even about  gels like duac and stuff like that?	2018-02-07 18:08:16Z	
15233	15236	This may be correct – or not. Nobody knows because this is lacking references. To improve your answer please edit it and backup your statements with reliable references.	2018-02-06 17:31:55Z	LangLangC
15233	15236	Thank you, what would you consider a low fat, moderate carb for a 175lb male?	2018-02-06 18:59:49Z	
15233	15236	Oh I didn't see your comment on the protein intake. Everyone just says 1g per pound of body weight and I was 180lbs when I started cutting.	2018-02-07 06:44:17Z	
15222	15225	Even in a clean incision I'd be wary about suturing a distal based flap on the  anterior shin.	2018-02-05 22:10:05Z	Graham Chiu
15222	15225	Yup, I mentioned a skin flap in my answer-- anything with necrotic or soon-to-be necrotic tissue is not a good candidate for suturing.	2018-02-06 01:41:46Z	Nate
15222	15225	I should answer with my 25 cm leg laceration images	2018-02-06 01:43:09Z	Graham Chiu

15216	15220	Welcome to Health.SE. We encourage reputable, written sources, and youtube is not considered one of them. Take a look at this collection of quality sources	2018-02-05 20:16:30Z	Narusan-in-coma
15216	15220	@Narusan-in-coma Thanks for the feedback. I have removed the previous sources and added other sources from the approved list of sources.	2018-02-05 20:19:55Z	Wadih M.
15216	15220	@WadihM. Just to clarify: that list is not a canonical list of "approved sources". they are most often an indicator of quality but then also not to be trusted blindly. Think of them as "strongly preferred". You have to evaluate everything yourself. It is merely a starting point for you to choose from, (and maybe even add to), if you compare them with what you come across. Sources vary in their quality and you might find poor info from sources on that list as well, although  that should be rare. Browse around on meta for more.	2018-02-05 21:11:11Z	LangLangC

15210	10032	Shower water temperature varies from place to place. So does one's criterion of what is a "cold shower".  In addition, there is no evidence in the medical literature that so-called "cold showers" prevent the development of hypertension, either in those people who got that genetic inheritance or in those who are going to develop secondary hypertension.  The same goes for depressive disorder, brain function, etc.   I've read the site your answer mentions and it is all bullshit, probably written by a quack or someone who just wants to get public attention.	2016-11-10 22:55:39Z	Centaurus

15203	15204	I like that the answer is concise and to the point. Perhaps, to keep in line with the site policies on references, something like this abstract can be added: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12616989. It illustrates the example of diabetic patients that you gave.	2018-02-03 19:28:25Z	Lucky

15194	15195	I’m not sure which point of your answer the CJD quote supports: it says nothing about lethality or being an infection. Merely about contagion.	2018-02-02 18:33:52Z	Konrad Rudolph
15194	15195	It's the source of the quote	2018-02-02 19:00:43Z	Graham Chiu
15194	15195	I'm asking about the purpose of that quote.	2018-02-02 19:01:47Z	Konrad Rudolph
15194	15195	Oh, to support that it can be an infectious disease	2018-02-02 19:03:18Z	Graham Chiu
15194	15195	Classifying CJD as infectious is a bit controversial: less "living" than a virus and: "Sporadic spongiform encephalopathy occurs in … due to persistence and proliferation of an abnormal native protein. [Therfor] it is similar to neoplastic disease. Unlike traditional proliferative disorders that require cellular replication, the prion can transmit its abnormal conformation to a neighboring prion protein and thereby cause proliferation of the abnormality.	2018-02-02 19:50:51Z	LangLangC

15194	15196	@Nate My reading of the OP was 100% (plus error margin) and of course, if untreated. Rabies & HAT are both difficult to treat and time is of the essence. Are you looking for perfect 100% and absolutely untreatable?	2018-02-02 19:35:55Z	LangLangC
15194	15196	I'd make plus error margin 101% :)	2018-02-02 20:14:17Z	Graham Chiu

15184	15185	Your first tip is exactly how I've swallowed pills since I was a child. I've never seen anyone else do so and I always found that strange since it makes it much easier.	2018-02-01 22:35:02Z	Carey Gregory

15184	15259	It is my experience that floating and sinking are not particularly strong forces in this case. Tilting your chin up stretches and constricts your throat and makes it harder to swallow anything, even spit. Try it yourself right now.	2018-02-07 21:43:33Z

15176	15186	Beautifully answered!  I agree it may have been a way they simplify telling patients not to worry about an option, which I have seen done plenty of times - I too disagree with that approach.  Also I'd give an extra +1 if I could for the final paragraph.	2018-02-03 00:02:43Z	DoctorWhom
15157	15349	It might profit this answer if some aspects of the volatile comments were included here. Touchy issues in general, maybe touchy issue in this "case".	2018-02-16 22:04:39Z	LangLangC
15157	15349	Hmm... there's a lot of good information in those comments. I'll need time to find references.	2018-02-17 22:57:16Z	Dave Liu
15157	15349	This answers my question. When I wish to die, or imagine killing myself, it's due to the lack of coping skills. When I feel frustrated or angry, it is my way of letting it out and then feeling pity for myself. I think that calms me down (maybe by taking mind away from the issue). The current edited version of my original question is not what I was asking at all. But I am glad your answer answered my original question (which may have been unclear the way I originally wrote it). Also, I can assure that I do not feel depression.	2018-02-21 06:21:44Z	
15157	15349	Narusan tried to reword the question to be more general, because we don't address personal-diagnosis type questions. That was probably why it was voted to be closed at first. Glad this was helpful though, hope things improve.	2018-02-21 21:04:26Z	Dave Liu
15154	15297	An odd omission; nothing about the theory of human co-evolution with intestinal helminths, and their ability to sculpt the human immune system.	2018-02-10 17:38:49Z	Graham Chiu
15151	15152	if the patient next day saw a regular color stool(brown color). What does that mean ?	2018-01-29 20:26:05Z	
15151	15152	It would make it less likely that there was a bleed causing the red stool, but it wouldn't rule it out. If the stool is always red after eating pomegranates, and always goes back to normal in a day, then that would be pretty good evidence that it was caused by the pomegranates, but the only way to be sure is to see a doctor.	2018-01-29 22:35:58Z	Nate
15145	15148	Where would one acquire such tests? Presumably not over the internet?....	2018-01-30 10:02:20Z	
15145	15148	A gastroenterologist can order tests for celiac disease and fructose malabsorption; an allergologist for food allergies and a primary doctor for blood iron levels and parasites in the stool. Symptoms "dramatically" decreasing on low-calorie diet are probably due to lower amount of soluble fiber ingested. So, one solution to try first can be to get (some) proteins from sources other than legumes. Test kits available on the internet may be unreliable.	2018-01-30 10:13:09Z	Jan

15141	15146	Clearly EMS will honor a valid DNR regardless of the patient's prior medical history, but that still leaves the question of whether a perfectly healthy person could obtain a DNR. Since it requires a physician's signature and I have a hard time seeing any physician signing off on such a DNR, I suspect the answer is no.	2018-01-29 18:07:24Z	Carey Gregory
15141	15146	Nope, tons of healthy people (including doctors) have DNRs. I've edited my response to reflect that.	2018-01-29 18:19:10Z	Nate
15141	15146	Interesting. Things have changed in the last 10 years. Go figure.	2018-01-30 05:25:45Z	Carey Gregory
15141	15146	Is there conditions and levels of DNRs?  Like the healthy doctors you mentioned. Does the DNR specify in which case it's applicable? If they were hit by a car and stopped breathing, would they not want to be revived?	2018-02-02 12:48:12Z	
15141	15146	The original, more "old school" DNR let you decide yes or no on both "Do Not Resuscitate" and "Do Not Intubate". The newer MOLST forms and other advance directives let you give much more specific information regarding what type of treatment you want, and whether you'd be OK doing it short term or long term. molst-ma.org/sites/molst-ma.org/files/…	2018-02-02 15:43:05Z	Nate
15141	15144	So what you're saying is that an otherwise healthy person cannot have a DNR. Yes? It has to be approved by a doctor?	2018-01-29 09:10:15Z	
15141	15144	Yes, needs doctor to sign the form to validate it.	2018-01-29 09:33:30Z	Graham Chiu
15141	15144	Actually I think this information is outdated (published 1999), see my answer below re: the MOLST form (published 2010).	2018-01-29 13:38:59Z	Nate
15141	15247	In the state I live in, DNR orders outside of a hospital or physician's office have strict rules. An EMT in my state cannot legally honor something like that tattoo. It would be legally meaningless.	2018-02-06 20:44:28Z	Carey Gregory
15130	15131	Do you have any references to any articles which back up your claims and maybe provide more depth?	2018-01-28 23:34:28Z	Chris
15130	15131	This is a really good answer, but as @Chris mentioned, supporting references are expected here. They don't have to be extensive, just sufficient to support your main points.	2018-01-29 05:20:53Z	Carey Gregory
15130	15131	Welcome @RudyB, awesome answer! We have a references standard even for docs - and I know it's kind of a pain to add a reference or two when you've spent like 12 grueling years post-high school training (let alone X years working) to obtain that knowledge base, it really helps maintain the quality of the site and gives non-medical-professionals additional reading material to further explore and understand better. And partially because we can't certify who has what level of training/education here.	2018-01-29 21:30:42Z	DoctorWhom
15130	15131	I would love to add references, but aside from a general EKG interpretation text (Dubin's has always been my favorite), the ACLS Student Manual and, for more depth, the consensus publications in Circulation the rest of my statements have been an overview of how we got here from where we were 30 years ago in resuscitation, information from manufacturer's manuals for defib/ pacer units that are not available online, and an unpublished case series that I cannot publicly release. Please provide some more specifics for which references as my one answer could probably have 30.	2018-02-05 02:23:49Z	RudyB
15173	15174	that's the average risk if you have no knowledge about a person's risk category. in the extreme case, if someone is in a room with an animal with rabies, they'll be at extremely elevated risk relative to baseline. if someone lives in a small room with a wild animal with rabies, they'll be at pretty elevated risk. if someone lives with an animal at high risk for rabies, they're probably at pretty elevated risk.	2018-01-27 23:24:08Z	lahwran
15123	15124	Great answer! Perhaps there could also be another factor: if you stop fever too early, you make a necessary antibiotic treatment more likely maybe? I would love to watch or read your presentation if you would be willing to share it.	2018-01-27 22:02:32Z	
15123	15124	I would just correct "treating a fever is a tradeoff between potentially feeling better faster" with "treating a fever is a tradeoff between potentially feeling better now" as antipyretics work relatively fast. As you have mentioned fever is not pleasant and it is about symptomatic treatment versus definitive treatment of the underlying infection.	2018-01-28 06:38:58Z	RudyB
15123	15124	I suggest replacing trademark "Thylenol" with generic names as "paracetamol" or "acetaminophen". It takes googling to understand your answer if one comes from country where Thylenol is not popular popular enough to become a synonym.	2018-01-28 14:56:20Z	Agent_L
15123	15124	@Agent_L Unfortunately I don’t think “acetaminophen” is widely known either, at least not in European countries where the name “paracetamol” is common. (And conversely, I doubt Americans generally know what paracetamol is.)	2018-01-29 10:06:04Z	Konrad Rudolph
15123	15124	@KonradRudolph just made a compromise that's not super elegant but should work	2018-01-29 13:09:27Z	Nate
15110	15111	Ok, good to know! Thanks. So for me personally, there are obviously things to clean up further in my diet to continue to lean up.	2018-01-25 14:55:00Z	
15103	15112	Thank you very much for your answer Nate! 1.) My bad, I cited quickly some studies, but I could have found better ones. 2.) Personally, I am not at all concerned about weight since I am slim with very low body fat - I am mostly concerned about ageing. I would do anything that is "healthy" (prolonging lifespan, better immune response, slower ageing, higher resistance to carcinogenesis) and in my power. Hence, I wanted to know if we already can infer something from the evidence we have. I already eat healthily, yet if the time pattern helps in such an amazing way, I'd change it too.	2018-01-25 23:41:48Z	
15103	15112	@Fipah Unfortunately studies on longevity  and ageing take a VERY long time (since you might not notice an effect for decades). The same goes for rates of cancer growth.   Trying to infer from incomplete evidence is very tempting, and people do it all the time. The majority of the time, though, all the tantalizing connections people come up with turn out to be incorrect.   A big part of diet and health more broadly is how you feel-- I'd say if an intermittent fasting diet makes you feel good, do it. You're not likely to find conclusive evidence on the topic for decades, if ever.	2018-01-26 22:38:43Z	Nate
15103	15112	Thanks for your comment @Nate! I was thinking maybe quicker studies on mice and rats might allow us to extrapolate because they have shown promising evidence, yet I understand - we are not mice nor rats and studies on humans will take long. // I feel good both ways (eating meals throughout the day or eating in an 8 hour window only) since I feel good and I am healthy in general - I'd just want to do what is "healthier" for me on the level I cannot directly feel, say if such and such way of eating reduces telomere shortening I think I would not be able to directly sense it.	2018-01-27 11:00:11Z	
15094	15095	It means twice daily, which means every 12 hours. Local policy might allow some leeway there, but that's what it means universally.	2018-01-24 20:51:34Z	Carey Gregory
15089	15100	Yeah i was at the doctor and i have staph aureus. He told my throat looks clear and he do not want to give me antibiotics so i should gargle salt water with some herbs (but i forgot wich one).(I have some smelling white dots in my tonsils that i am taking out) But gargling salt water do nothing. I used citricidal before like for 10 days and now after short pause 5days and it took only one or two days without citricidal and i have white tongue. I hope citricidal helps :)	2018-01-24 18:40:58Z

15061	15065	Are you sure about the point that "The only known side effects of influenza vaccines are temporary nasal congestion"? Google (and personal experience) suggests that common side effects include soreness, redness, swelling, headache, fever, nausea, and muscle aches.	2018-01-24 21:10:21Z	Shane
15061	15065	@Shane Good point. The paper's wording was "adverse events" (instead of side effects) caused by the vaccine so I guess they didn't include things that were not threatening to health. I can't tell you why they didn't include those kinds of side effects.	2018-01-25 14:12:50Z	StrConDexWisIntCha
15061	15065	Herd immunity is important for many diseases, but in the specific case of the flu vaccine's ineffectiveness, I don't think herd immunity is relevant. The reason the flu vaccine is relatively ineffective is that flu strains evolve very quickly, so there's a high probability that you'll contract a strain that the vaccine doesn't help against. Since everyone is receiving a vaccine that protects against the same strains, herd immunity doesn't help with that problem.	2018-01-26 05:36:13Z	ruakh
15061	15065	@ruakh If you read the link shared by the OP regarding the 40%-60% estimate you'll see the CDC says that's in seasons when it is well matched to the particular prevalent strains that season. In cases where the vaccine is well matched to the strains of flu that are spreading in that particular season, herd immunity is certainly relevant. In cases where it is not well matched, obviously it won't keep you or the "herd" from catching/spreading the flu. What you're saying is "sometimes the flu vaccine doesn't work, and when it doesn't work... it doesn't work".	2018-01-26 14:17:03Z	StrConDexWisIntCha

15061	15070	"You are probably confusing the flu (influenza) with the common cold, which is colloquially often called 'the flu'" Another common confusion would be Gastroenteritis, which causes vomiting and is often called the stomach flu but is not caused by influenza.	2018-01-24 17:26:25Z	Ray
15061	15070	@jpmc26 WHO/NHS/CDC... receive lots of money - Of course they do. Serving the health needs of millions of people is expensive. Since vaccines prevent disease, their use reduces the demand for health services. As for  whether Natural News has an incentive to lie; as you say, if it can deliver actual results it would make a mint. However, if its products turned out to be ineffective, how else could it make a sale?	2018-01-26 13:17:41Z	Oscar Bravo
15061	15070	@jpmc26 It’s more that “several unrelated, governmental and intergovernmental agencies from across the world are in agreement”. You’d need to posit a world-wide conspiracy to explain why they would all publish the same lies (and, sure, some people believe that; it’s not worth arguing with them, though).	2018-01-26 19:04:51Z	Konrad Rudolph
15061	15070	@jpmc26 I did edit that paragraph to make it clearer. But I really don’t want to tread out this purely incidental point any further. The answer is already too long, and the topic here is influenza, not the credibility of various health sources. I don’t really think I should have to argue extensively why scientific sources are superior on a health site. — That said, consensus totally is a valid argument in a discussion of whether somebody is telling the truth. The same lie being repeated by many independent sources is simply less likely.	2018-01-26 19:20:02Z	Konrad Rudolph
15061	15062	FYI… Recent estimates published 2017 say between 291,000 and 646,000 people worldwide die from seasonal influenza-related respiratory illnesses each year.	2018-01-23 04:09:41Z	Basil Bourque
15061	15062	How many of these deaths are healthy 40 year olds tho?  I've always assumed all these deaths are either very young or very old and mostly people that don't have access to good medical care.  To the OPs point, is there a real risk of the flu being anything other than annoying to him?	2018-01-23 14:28:55Z	JPhi1618
15061	15062	The UK is now providing the vaccine to those in secondary school - ages 10-15. I don’t know if they also provide it in primary school for 4-9 year olds.	2018-01-23 16:57:38Z	Tim
15061	15062	@JPhi1618 I've added a link to hospitalization rates stratified by age.	2018-01-23 18:39:32Z	Graham Chiu
15061	15062	@JPhi1618 Important to note: by getting vaccinated, you would help protect the very young and very old (and the immunocompromised, of any age)	2018-01-23 20:50:06Z	Alexander
15061	15082	Good answer with great images, except that "Vaccines aren't meant to stop diseases by making invulnerable individuals. They never have been." is just rubbish. That's not their only effect, but vaccines do not only exist for herd immunity. Vaccines are actually primarily intended to prevent the vaccinated person from getting the disease. Otherwise the HPV vaccine for example would not only be available to girls.	2018-01-23 22:15:25Z	Miles Rout
15061	15082	@MilesRout I misword that, I'll edit it. But has any vaccine ever achieved (100%) "invulnerable" status? It's a "nice to have" for sure, but vaccine efficacy has diminishing returns. Increasing efficacy from 99.0% to 99.1% wouldn't be worth it, if the same resources could have been used to cause a large rise in vaccination rates, instead.	2018-01-23 22:50:18Z	Alexander
15061	15082	@MilesRout Many health professionals are proponents of routinely giving the HPV vaccine to boys for precisely this reason. The reason that this isn't currently done is a (previous, no longer) lack of studies, ethical considerations and (unfortunately) flawed economics arguments. (The situation had changed in the meantime, as there's now evidence for a beneficial effect of the vaccine in men, too.)	2018-01-23 23:17:40Z	Konrad Rudolph
15061	15082	@Alexander of course they don't get to 100%, but it's still the goal.	2018-01-24 22:24:53Z	Miles Rout
15061	15082	@MilesRout Yes, but not at the expense of underfunding initiatives to drive up vaccination rates\	2018-01-24 23:04:32Z	Alexander
15061	15074	Good points.  If you're worried about scary stuff like formaldehyde, you'd end up having a very restricted diet because it occurs naturally in many foods.	2018-01-23 14:35:45Z	JPhi1618
15061	15074	Also worth noting about formaldehyde: our own cells produce it as a waste product. Our renal system has no problem filtering it out and processing it into urine. I am not sure how much of it from a vaccine would overload our own natural processes for filtering it. However, Occam's razor tells me that since there are not droves of people in the ER after receiving vaccines, they probably do not contain enough to cause any problems.	2018-01-23 15:51:19Z	
15061	15074	For perspective, 800 flu shots would be about the same weight as the rat, maybe a little more.	2018-01-23 22:24:56Z	Charles
15061	15074	"Injecting a syringe full of mercury into your body is definitely a bad idea." OK it's probably not a clever thing to do, but would it actually harm you in this form, or just be excreted?	2018-01-24 11:41:59Z	RedSonja
15061	15074	Minor nitpick: the LD50 is a decent frame of reference, but it can be misleading. For substances that we metabolize and/or excrete easily, safe doses and the LD50 can be an order of magnitude apart or more. In between you have non-lethal doses that still cause significant acute harm (e.g. liver damage). For substances that we have trouble removing (such as certain heavy metal compounds), you can have chronic damage from doses multiple orders of magnitude smaller than the LD50.	2018-01-24 14:43:12Z	Ian

15060	15075	Many people are prone to be too low in iodine. The "(typical groups of) Japanese" part makes a less than ideal match to "you" without clarification. Not counting hereditary/genetics: esp the late/sudden introduction of high levels of iodine (in a diet) might necessitates more care, guidance, and monitoring of thyroid function. Kombu, nori etc might pack quite too much of a punch! If no analysis label is on the stuff intake should very probably be limited somewhat. A general 'clean' bill is ill advised.	2018-02-03 04:47:39Z	LangLangC
15052	15077	Since we require some references from you to prove your points: how about providing evidence for "will not keep you out of the Egyptian military." and why. Although the other assertions might benefit as well.	2018-01-24 03:33:42Z	LangLangC
15052	15077	Thanks for the answer. You're right about the military. I just wanted to confirm that I have immunosuppressant therapy by catching those kinds of viruses. It's just one evidence among some other evidence that I will provide.	2018-01-24 03:48:53Z

14967	14975	Hello,@langlang   By all means, you can add minority of Doctors may get annoyed. That would help. In perfect world, Doctor is supposed to have infinite patience (after all they are treating sick people). However, I haven't been on the Doctor side, so who knows what challenges Doctors are faced with in our Healthcare system. Of course, patient and their company must also be respectful and understanding.	2018-01-19 23:35:42Z	
14954	15002	I wasn't looking for practical advice (which I understand) but a more technical explanation of why signs of spoilage correlate strongly with the presence of toxins. The consensus seems to be that the correlation isn't really that strong.	2018-01-17 17:44:06Z	
14954	15002	But it's hard for me to understand what evolution would explain. You say that we evolved to recognize dangers, but then you say that we're often wrong. You describe underestimating danger; do we also sometimes overestimate danger, because mold produced green fuzz and an odor, but no toxins? Why don't you suppose that it's the microbes evolving, producing signs of spoilage to keep us from eating them and their dinner, regardless of the actual danger?	2018-01-17 17:44:14Z	
14954	15002	@Chaim Because we are not perfect organisms designed by an intelligent creator. We got good at detecting spoiled food but not perfect. But your hypothesis that there is a mutually beneficial co-evolution with molds developing odors to prevent animals from eating them isn't implausible either.	2018-01-17 17:57:39Z	Philipp
14940	15078	We require reliable supporting references. Please back up some of your points with external evidence.	2018-01-23 16:19:16Z	LangLangC
14936	14957	That's a quite interesting start of an answer. If you'll include more from the "scientific studies"  part or one more reliable source and a bit more weighing between claims and results it will improve further. [E.g. All these hormones, are they in DAV and not in meat? ] Also: why not quote the last paragraph from your find in the NZ medical journal? That answers the question in its essence.	2018-01-14 11:13:47Z	LangLangC
14932	14947	The 'resistance' part is probably not so much applicable here. From a theoretical view the main problem is the assumed wholesale destruction or removal of everything, including beneficial bacteria. But I think the analogy you used holds up.	2018-01-12 12:38:04Z	LangLangC
14932	14947	You're right, I've reordered arguments so that it doesn't appear as the first one.	2018-01-12 12:54:15Z	
14932	14947	Note that as far as the device I was interested in is concerned, it should be about as safe as plain water...	2018-01-12 18:29:14Z	
14932	14947	Very important item needing edit: "there has been no evidence of the development of cross-resistance to antibiotics due to the use of antibacterial wash products in the community" is not true, they've actually banned triclosan soaps in the USA for this reason. See fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm378393.htm  with pertinent quote " laboratory studies have raised the possibility that triclosan contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Some data shows this resistance may have a significant impact on the effectiveness of medical treatments, such as antibiotics."	2018-01-15 20:14:26Z	DoctorWhom
14932	14947	I realize you're likely not talking about triclosan being the additive of the shower water, but for accuracy sake it's important to note there are harms to antibacterial treatments.  There is terrifying resistance emerging.	2018-01-15 20:17:15Z	DoctorWhom
14932	14948	Thanks for your input.  I didn't link to the product in this question because I figured other claims were out of scope and wanted to focus on this single claim.  I think most of your answer is more suitable to my question on skeptics.SE (which is currently deleted since it was "poorly written" according to folks there, but I will rewrite it soon).	2018-01-12 12:23:23Z	
14932	14948	You are right about this and thx for such focus. Mainly meant as an addendum to your answer, since I was searching along those lines you already wrote up. Some water is too contaminated for use but this device is for germaphobes and 'inspired' people – if it would work.	2018-01-12 12:33:38Z	LangLangC

14925	15079	Thanks for the edit. Tiny bit of criticism: at least your first link is a prime candidate for link rot in the future. Further improvement is therefore possible by directly and visibly quoting from that source.	2018-01-23 16:45:47Z	LangLangC

14920	14928	The triceps muscle tendon is attached to the upper part of the olecranon ( link ) and tight triceps may cause olecranon pain, but I think this pain would be higher from where the X is. There are tendons of some forearm muscles that are attached lower (closer to X). T	2018-01-11 08:54:10Z	Jan

14892	14894	@CareyGregory What I'm trying to say is that OP never specified the cardiovascular issues he is having, or the ones his mother is having.  While the aspirin you suggest may be helpful in the event of a heart attack or one type of stroke, it could be potentially fatal in the event of a different cardiac failure, haemorrhagic stroke. Neither you nor OP should take aspirin unless you are sure that it is the best course of action. And yes, haemorrhagic stroke is a cardiac issue.

14843	14845	Mostly a great answer @Glorfindel but please also include that water intoxication can be fatal - even in healthy kidneys. Hyponatremia is one serious complication of ingesting too much free water, and it can be fatal.  The text you copied into your answer suggests that 24L of free water (1L /hr) could be managed by healthy kidneys, which is not true - at least not for very long.  You would have to click on the superscript link 12 on that wikipedia link to find that critical information.  There is a safety limit, for which I will try to find a good resource that more clearly defines it.	2018-01-03 20:49:10Z	DoctorWhom

14811	14823	To give some background info, my Dad got piles surgery in 1965 in India (age 20). Over the decades the anus got narrow. In 2008 (age 63) my Dad got surgery in USA to expand size of anus. Colon-rectal surgeon did bad job and size of anus decreased further, plus inelasticity. Recent examination shows ulcers. He is scared to go for bowel movement as it is Burning, Itching, Paining, Bleeding (due to ulcers). Suppositories barely help, and all the laxatives he takes barely helps. Would colonoscopy help my Dad. Or shall we research Colon-rectal surgeon to manage the condition (no more surgery).	2018-01-01 01:42:30Z	
14811	14839	Thank you so much for your guidance and views. Colostomy - ouch, that is rather invasive. Steroids, on the other hand, I suppose we can ask about.

14758	14759	Needs clarification. CO2 or CO; i.e.: and/or both? "still contain some levels of nicotine, which immediately turns it into an unhealthier product." Up to that: That reads like this one substance is the most unhealthy part in this? "Purifying"? What to what/from what? – Looks like quite a bit of expertise, does not really answer the question marks in a straight way. (But seems to be on good way, if you address the issues mentioned and add more references to your assertions)	2017-12-26 03:23:46Z	LangLangC
14758	14759	@LangLangC Marry christmas	2017-12-26 03:31:02Z	SmokyPerson
14758	14759	Okay so, CO is carbon monoxide as far as I think I know and CO2 is carbon dioxide (di oxide and CO2 (notice the 2) - two molecules oxygen) and I said carbon dioxide which makes it clear that I talk about CO2. In much higher levels it could be deadly. What is healthier cannot be determined, I said it depends on the smoker and its hookah, but I would say the tar is the highest concern. Purifying, only one thing can "purify" and thats the hookah's water filtration. And when the tobacco is made, it is being soaked in water (which is some form of purification as well)	2017-12-26 03:35:47Z	SmokyPerson
14758	14759	@LangLangC thanks you! Also doing some research, I've spotted several places claiming "CO is deadlier" I don't know why, but CO poisoning seems more a general case	2017-12-26 03:42:24Z	SmokyPerson
14758	14759	But yes, thanks for pointing my attention there. It seems that my not nativeness to the language creates some gaps. Yes, CO is indeed being released from smoking.	2017-12-26 03:48:57Z	SmokyPerson

14712	14721	For what would anyone need this supplement? -- I started taking fish oil supplements about 10 years ago when I read that it could prevent chalazions. I started getting them 2-3 times per year about 15 years ago, and since they take months to heal, that meant I had one going most of the year. Since starting fish oil, I haven't had a single one. Purely anecdotal, but it's hard to argue with those results and it's one possible answer to your question.	2017-12-21 02:04:06Z	Carey Gregory
14696	14702	Wow, this is fantastic! One question though regarding your statement "Cornflakes are not 98% corn". I am looking at the ingredient list of Kellog's Corn Flakes ("The Original", as sold in Israel) and it clearly says Corn (98%). So what's going on here?	2017-12-17 14:19:53Z	
14696	14702	Not sure, food labeling laws differ. But look at the salt and sugars added, previously just not found in the corn. Maybe they make the sugary part from HFCS and that then counts as 'made from corn'? Dry weight vs volume as calculation base, Israel's CFs made different? Do you have a link to these ingredients specifically?	2017-12-17 14:25:21Z	LangLangC
14696	14702	Well if they say 98% that presumably only leaves 2% for anything else (including sugar and salt). I doubt they'd get away with chalking HFCS as corn, it is usually mentioned explicitly. Not sure about weight/volume or how that would change things. Israel CF made different quite likely, we need it to be Kosher anyway.

14685	14728	This is very virtuous, displaying good morals. But does it answer the question concerning the dosage and backs these findings up with references? – I guess nobody in their right mind will say smoking is healthy and the general agreement points towards not starting or quitting as best options. Fundamentalist morality tales often backfire in terms of achieving harm reduction. Coming down from 60 cigs to 3 day is an improvement. To repeat: I agree with what you wrote in principle, but in the context of the question asked it might be much improved by focusing more on doses.	2017-12-21 14:12:07Z	LangLangC
14685	14728	@LangLangC spot on.	2018-01-14 18:48:17Z	
14642	14644	I would just correct one aspect : the roots are covered by cementum. If you remove the cementum from the root (by brushing too hard or having a cavity) or enamel from the tooth (for similar reasons, as well as grinding, eating acidic food), you will expose the underplaying dentin.	2018-02-18 01:53:11Z	enap_mwf
14642	14644	Indeed the root is covered by cement as long as the cement is protected by periodontal tissues. Periodontal disease is the cause of exposure and removal of the cementum. Google for any image of root under microscope, as google.cl/…:	2018-02-18 02:28:35Z	sergiouribe

14552	14553	@JohnP Updated it. With hips & spine, I meant the pars lumbalis and cingulum membri pelvini provide support as bones, as well as the many muscles around / included in said organs. I tried not to go into too much detail since the OP didn’t seem to versed in medical slang etc. Also, clearing up the misconception that we had blood blobs inside our body seemed more important to me. // Also, I‘m not a native speaker and translating medical terminology is a pain, so sorry if „hips and spine“ was too broad.	2017-12-04 14:00:13Z	Narusan-in-coma

14531	14532	I don’t have much to add to that. Maybe you can just quote your Emergency book and give a source, and point out that the victims were dead once (drowned), resuscitated and died (most likely) from the consequences of the cardiac arrest and weren’t able to be revived then. But a solid answer, +1 from me	2017-12-01 20:40:15Z	Narusan-in-coma
14531	14532	@Narusan-sedated and Kermilli, can you spell out for me how long the whole process might take?  To my eye, that "died a few hours later" looks strange.  If a child or teen is taken lifeless from the water, and does not respond to the first responders' attempts to resuscitate, but then does respond to the ER staff's efforts, what's the most amount of time that might go by between pulling from the water, and successfully getting revived?  Can it really be several hours?	2017-12-01 21:34:48Z	
14531	14532	@aparente001 The way I understand the story is that locals on scene were able to resuscitate the patient, but the patient died later nonetheless due to other consequences.	2017-12-01 21:35:57Z	Narusan-in-coma
14531	14532	@Narusan-sedated - I guess it's the glass half empty or half full.  I take "trying to revive the two boys" to mean they weren't having much luck.	2017-12-01 21:37:32Z	
14531	14532	Well, if you get someone out of the water lifeless, they are already (clinically) dead because their heart stopped beating for sure. So for them to die later on, they must have come back to life - in my understanding. CPR is not performed for hours until the patient is pronounced dead.	2017-12-01 21:38:46Z	Narusan-in-coma
14531	14538	Thanks -- this is helpful.  // Instead of "If you're going to drown, do it in salt water," don't you mean, "If you're going to run into trouble in the water, do it in salt water"? // Note that the text doesn't say anything about pulse or respiration.  Also note that the four adults may be assumed to not have any special expertise with medicine or emergency response.  They can't be relied upon to correctly perceive pulse or respiration -- they haven't had the training, and also they're busy freaking out.	2017-12-02 02:36:41Z	
14531	14538	Carey, can you spell out for me how long the whole process might take? If a child or teen is taken apparently lifeless from the water, and does not respond to the first responders' attempts to resuscitate, but then does respond to the ER staff's efforts, what's the most amount of time that might go by between pulling from the water, and successfully getting revived?	2017-12-02 02:40:56Z	
14531	14538	@aparente001 You're asking additional questions that are impossible to answer. That's not what comments are for. Ask a new question.	2017-12-02 05:20:42Z	Carey Gregory
14531	14538	Let me try to be clearer.  In your "edit," you wrote, "apparently rescuers were able to restore pulses."  WE DON'T KNOW THAT.  That is an unfair assumption.	2017-12-02 05:26:26Z	
14531	14538	@Narusan-sedated In the US the usual practice is for paramedics to provide three rounds of ACLS at the scene, and if a heartbeat isn't restored that's it. The patient is dead. But with pediatric patients and arrest due to drowning, a lot more effort is going to be made. I've never seen a pediatric patient left at the scene except in extreme trauma cases where clearly nothing can be done. Who knows what happened at the hospital. Maybe they got pulses restored but lost them again. Spending hours is unusual.	2017-12-02 17:22:45Z	Carey Gregory

14520	14521	Some males don't finish growing to final height until age 20 or so.	2017-12-01 13:25:45Z	DoctorWhom
14520	14521	@DoctorWhom Yeah, but that’s not really the question. I thought OP meant whether he could actively increase his final height, which they can’t. Whether they continue to grow significantly or not is not anyone’s decision, but already determined by the diet when OP was a toddler and by the genes	2017-12-01 13:38:10Z	Narusan-in-coma

14496	14506	As said in the question, the patient needed surgery to fix his intestine, could surgeons from elsewhere come to his hospital to operate? Does this happen in the US?	2017-11-30 03:07:13Z	
14496	14506	Also, I read that the preventable trauma death rate is 30% in South Korea, where there were no trauma centers up until a few years ago. Let's say a victim suffered severe abdominal internal bleeding from a motor vehicle collision in a country where there are zero trauma centers, what would this patient's journey be like, and why would he die compared to if he had this accident in the US for example?	2017-11-30 03:10:11Z	
14496	14506	@Anon No, bringing a surgeon to another hospital rarely happens in the US. The patient is transferred, not the surgeon. I don't know how to speculate on what would happen to a patient in South Korea vs. the US. I know nothing of the South Korean medical system.	2017-11-30 05:21:23Z	Carey Gregory

14486	14487	@CareyGregory I know what bulimia is. The question is not about causing vomiting to get rid of the consumed food. It is about causing mild nausea.	2017-11-28 18:27:45Z

14472	14517	Well, that source gives a rough estimate. 30g (80kg weight as reference) is like the Xylitol in two packages of toothpaste. I was wrong by factor 10. A bit off.	2017-11-30 14:28:40Z	Narusan-in-coma

14472	14534	What you've written here is a lot of hyperbolic opinion with the only support coming from non-credible sites with obvious agendas (poisonflouride.com and flouridealert.org -- you expect me to believe a word I find there?). The only credible sites you reference are articles that seem to have little or nothing to do with the claims you're making, which is a common tactic of alt-health scammers. -1 and if I could make it -10 I would.	2017-12-02 01:53:23Z	Carey Gregory
14472	14534	Alot of the data is from official USA sources,of course they take alot of analysis info from studies from non government affiliated sources. Of course they have an agenda;expose fluoride nonsens and dangers,and at minimum give another view,that's their agenda.   Exagerated claim,non credible? Like what and why exactly,what studies back your claim or refute without any doubts that it's not credible?    I don't expect you to be anything but be open minded,especially not believe, at least read,instead of just saying your opinion without any proofs. You're sounding very much closed minded.	2017-12-02 02:34:44Z	HerbalResearcher
14472	14534	-1 poisonalert.org, fluoridalert.org are not credible sources. I'd suggest removing them and focussing on what studies have found. Also, your answer only tangentially answers the question.	2017-12-02 06:11:25Z	Narusan-in-coma
14472	14534	I very much welcome a different outlook on the fluoride issue! And naturally, I completely disagree with this answer! The beneficial effects were discovered in cavity free people whose natural water supply was very fluoride rich causing fluorosis all over the place.  The dosage is important. A credible source showing detrimental effects of F in TP dosing and at least parity in caries prevention from "natural" TP would go a long way to strengthen this case. Impress me in finding that one.	2017-12-02 10:35:14Z	LangLangC
14472	14534	Narusan ,unless you prove why they're not credible, you can't suggest anything concerning removing.	2017-12-03 18:10:36Z	HerbalResearcher
14450	14456	So my understanding that sugar + starch + fiber = carbs was correct, and the label was wrong.	2017-11-24 08:44:45Z	
14450	14456	Yes. What's wrong in the label is "carbohydrate" amount.	2017-11-24 09:52:45Z	Jan
14450	14456	Labels never seem to mention starch. This should be included in carbohydrates.	2017-11-25 10:54:57Z	
14450	14483	In my example the carbs are 7.2g, the fiber is 8.6g. So carbs - fiber = -1.4g (a negative number)...	2017-11-27 14:35:42Z	
14450	14483	@Antinous - What I'm saying is that the company didn't include fiber in their "total carbs" number.  7.2 = 5.1 + 2.1.  Simple carbs (sugars) = 5.1.  That means that complex carbs (starches) = 2.1.  They didn't include fiber in their carbohydrate figure.  You will see that all nutritional labels follow this scheme.	2017-11-27 15:53:52Z	aparente001
14450	14483	This is bad news. So the carb reading on any nutritional packet is not the total carbs. Very misleading. You actually have to add fiber on top of that too. Any non specified carbs are just starch. This isn't very consumer clear. They should specifically state starch sugars and fiber under carbs IMO. Unless they're trying to deliberately confuse people. How is the consumer meant to know this (without resorting to SE !)	2017-11-27 20:03:31Z	
14450	14483	@Antinous In a correct label "Carbohydrates" ALWAYS refer to "Total carbohydrates" including starch, sugars and fiber. In the label from the photo, they just made an error from whatever reason.	2017-11-28 13:19:07Z	Jan
14450	14483	I agree @Jan but having looked at the UK/EU legal requirements for such information allows companies to display confusing information.	2017-11-28 14:25:44Z

14393	14420	I have heard cholera vaccine mentioned in multiple resources, perhaps this is the way to go! I wonder what "recurrent" means exactly. When I visit Nepal, I always stay for 1 month at least. If I get sick once during that time should I be immune for a while?	2017-11-21 20:15:09Z	
14390	14401	Thanks. Just quick review, is baking soda same as sodium bicarbonate?	2017-11-20 18:50:48Z	
14390	14401	@user12025 Usually yes. But that needs to be double checked. Depends on where you live. Some baking sodas, are really baking powders, adding sth like citric acid, which is a whole nother equation then and definitively not recommendable.	2017-11-20 18:55:19Z	LangLangC
14390	14401	OK, I bought one that say, it is sodium bicarbonate like big letters, and then below that say natrium hydrocarbonate e 500ii, and also that this product is made for food. Is this baking soda?	2017-11-20 19:01:39Z	
14390	14401	+ there is sentence: thing for lifting dough	2017-11-20 19:03:43Z	
14390	14401	As far as I read and understand it: absolutely. [That extra sentence shows just what it will do in baking. In baking that effect is then further enhanced in 'powders' with the acids added.

14355	14356	Thank you so much. Why would a drug have inactive ingredient?	2017-11-15 14:09:17Z	
14355	14356	@Asmani To make sure the active ingredient gets where it should (capsules), to decrease concentration of active ingredient, to make the patient tolerate the drug. You could go ahead and ask that as a new question, it is a good one.	2017-11-15 14:25:06Z	Narusan-in-coma
14355	14356	"The non-scientific article" is actually a well researched joy to read. I wanted to add a tidbit – but it's already in there. You might add more from that. // This expiration date is indeed an indicator of well meant and necessary regulation that's gone bad itself, leading to massive waste.	2017-11-15 14:35:37Z	LangLangC
14355	14356	What do they add in drug tablets when the amount of the drug is too small, like 1 mg Clonazepam?	2017-11-15 18:10:39Z	
14355	14356	@LangLangC That's true. For prescription drugs, it's often the prescription that expires before the drug itself actually expires and this can cause legal complications. For example, where I live, if you have some prescription pain killers left over (say, from a minor surgery when you didn't end up needing to take all of them,) if you have some other need for them come up later, it's illegal to take them after the prescription expiration, even though the drugs themselves may still be fine.	2017-11-15 20:54:59Z	reirab

14352	14353	Here is a paper about the physiology of an ultramarathoner: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23393784 This one only ran for 6 hours, some run for 24 or 48!	2017-11-15 14:21:24Z	Kate Gregory
14352	14353	So basically, it's the anaerobic processes of running that will lead to collapse, and not the aerobic processes?  Your muscles eventually die in the same way they would after perpetually lifting weights?	2017-11-15 23:09:07Z	
14352	14353	It's not so much the running, as the muscles requiring more oxygen than the circulatory system can deliver, which leads them to convert to an anaerobic process for energy. That in turn eventually leads to an excess amount of lactic acid that interferes with that anaerobic process.	2017-11-16 20:48:51Z	BillDOe
14352	14366	Sorry if I wasn't clear: we're assuming that the runner can't afford to pace himself.  He must continually go as fast as he can because he's, say, being chased by a pursuer.	2017-11-17 01:51:04Z	
14352	14366	@ArbitraryRenaissance Yeah, you need to provide necessary details with hypothetical questions. So with that constraint it becomes a simple question that could have been answered in the fitness exchange.	2017-11-17 05:11:32Z	Carey Gregory

14329	14346	Haemophilia  is not limited to men. Although the cases are very rare, haemohilia in females can occur. Daughters of a haemophilic man and a carrier woman are at 50% risk.	2017-11-15 08:28:10Z	Marzipanherz
14329	14346	@Marzipanherz Relevant passage: Very rarely, a girl might be born with a very low clotting factor and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to to boys who have haemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of haemophilia in females.. Just interested: Why the 50% risk?	2017-11-15 14:32:01Z	Narusan-in-coma
14329	14346	@Narusan-sedated The daughter would get the affected X-chromosome from her father and has a 50/50-chance to either get the affected or the healthy X-chromosome from her carrier mother. However, I do not know, whether haemophilia alters the fetuses survival chance, so the rate of alive-born girls might be different than 50/50.	2017-11-15 14:45:16Z	Marzipanherz
14329	14346	@Jasper I did not down vote, so I can not give you a reason. I just thought that your simplification was not really necessary here. Maybe edit the answer to state that those cases are very rare and thus there is little literature and then go on with your description of menstruation in other bleeding disorders. I really liked that part :) Btw: Here on Health.SE  valid sources/references are expected.  Missing links might have caused the downvotes as well.	2017-11-15 16:54:12Z	Marzipanherz
14329	14346	I did downvote. It’s just that I a) like things to be correct or at least have a notice that this is simplified and b) we as a site require sources for claims.

14328	14330	I must be dense, because that sounds like the same result as the Copay after deductible.  Example: With zero deductible paid, you go to the specialist doctor.  You pay $50 to the receptionist.  Total bill is $500.  You get a bill later for $450. You pay that.  Can you explain the difference between "with" and "after" using this scenario?	2017-11-14 20:31:40Z

14306	14311	By AED, do you mean one of these things? I'm not sure what good one of those would do for a broken bone, although I suppose sending overly curious bystanders to look for one could be useful to get them out of the way.	2017-11-13 00:08:36Z	Ilmari Karonen
14306	14311	Could you add a bit about how to notice the fracture in non-obvious (no visible displacement) cases? Or should that go on a separate question?	2017-11-13 00:59:20Z	Džuris
14306	14311	@Džuris You cannot.  If you have broken bone, the last thing you want is to move it around until it hurts.  If it gives you shooting pain, it is obviously broken, but if you're not sure, there's really no way to "know" with external observation.	2017-11-13 06:07:46Z	Nelson
14306	14311	@Džuris That should be another question. Basically though, swollen limb, pain when moving it and a recent “crash” of some sort (falling done stairs i.e.) are good indicators. When bones snap it becomes obvious.	2017-11-13 06:18:21Z	Narusan-in-coma
14306	14311	It is not always obvious when there is a fracture, actually. There are MANY types of fractures.  For example, telling between sprain and fracture and contusion in an ankle injury is not simple.  Trained professionals use the Ottawa criteria to determine likelihood of fracture and need for XRay.  But it's not advised for non-trained. Pain accompanies almost all fractures, swelling most all, instability many.  But don't try to figure out if it is displaced - that is the role of an XRay.  You can break off bone fragments and impede healing if you try - and you may create a displacement yourself.	2017-11-13 06:58:51Z	DoctorWhom

14306	14324	What constitutes "no way they could have a spinal injury?"	2017-11-14 13:52:03Z	Carey Gregory
14306	14324	@CareyGregory Like I said, if you're asking a question like that, you're in the wrong place.  No-one here can answer that question for you.  Anyone who claims to be able to reliably give you that kind of information online is a positive danger to you and yours.  And I don't want to be too rude, but anyone who thinks finding a little information online is good enough is also a danger to anyone they are responsible for.  Find yourself a first-aid course, and be safe.	2017-11-14 14:58:08Z	Graham
14306	14324	@Graham It would be hard for you to misunderstand my comment more than you apparently did. The question was rhetorical and my point was precisely that it's impossible for laymen to make such a determination. I've had a wee bit more than a first aid course.	2017-11-14 15:40:35Z	Carey Gregory
14306	14324	@CareyGregory My apologies then. :) FWIW, if someone's just dropped a heavy object on their foot/hand, then it's reasonable to expect there's no spinal injury.  A first aid course covers enough to do a halfway-safe check, although of course we're in no way as good as someone with real training.  A layman can make that determination to some degree - but they need to know enough about the circumstances of the injury, and to know the limitations of where they're safe to make that call.	2017-11-14 16:34:40Z	Graham

14279	14317	Thanks for taking the time to help, but please avoid giving medical advice.  If both doctors really told the OP not to do anything but swim, there might be something other than just the scoliosis behind that recommendation.  Almost anything physical you do involves the spine to one degree or another, as it is the axial skeleton.  I think the OP is incorrect in how he understood the advice.

14261	14263	Church chaplains are professionals and (in my country) help you without you holding their faith. Help is really irrelevant of faith too.	2017-11-08 13:34:49Z	Narusan-in-coma
14261	14263	It's not that. The religion/church is fine, but people think I am religious, I don't want them to be mad at me because I don't believe in god or something and it doesn't help if they are talking about god and jesus miracles in order to help me.	2017-11-08 13:38:50Z	
14261	14263	Well, only a professional can diagnose you, and they need to know you and your medical background. We can’t perform tests over the Internet (obviously) and we do not give personal medical advice. You shouldn’t trust anybody else on the interne either, because there’s no way to prove the credentials. This is why I tried to help you where to go to get an answer.	2017-11-08 13:43:30Z	Narusan-in-coma
14261	14263	@ShadowXsc You need to see a psychologist/counselor/therapist and I also recommend a general practice doctor.  It's not about "just talking to someone."  Your symptoms are most likely depression, which is common and it is treatable.  But you also might have hypothyroidism or anemia or other causes of fatigue and concentration troubles.  You should be checked out. It's your quality of life at stake, and there are a lot of places in the world that charge "sliding scale" (based on what you can pay).	2017-11-08 15:37:11Z	DoctorWhom

14250	14251	Why so much more iron in the spleen than in the liver? I mean yes, breaking down red blood cells does mean that a lot of iron is left as a byproduct. But doesn't every hepatocyte have ferritin, a protein to store iron? So why is it then that 1 serving of beef liver has only 28% recommended iron while beef spleen has 673% recommended iron?	2017-11-07 18:28:46Z	
14250	14251	It's just the way it is...More red blood cells are probably broken down in the spleen. And then it just depends on the storage capacity.	2017-11-07 18:56:39Z	Jan
14250	14251	1 serving (3 oz, 85 g) of beef spleen has 33.5 mg iron, which is 124% RDA. In a live animal, the spleen acts as a blood reservoir, so I assume, more blood (hemoglobin) and thus iron stays in it after cutting out than in the liver.	2017-11-08 08:34:42Z	Jan
14240	14315	I think the root of this question is asking about whether it is duration of therapy or max concentration that has greater adverse impact on renal function. Taking 250 twice daily leads to a lower max serum concentration.	2017-11-13 06:48:39Z	DoctorWhom
14240	14315	@DoctorWhom, agreed. And lower doses more often leads to a more constant serum level, rather than peaks and valleys.	2017-11-13 19:50:11Z	BillDOe

14240	14312	Your statement, "But if the 250mg isn't strong enough to reduce the symptoms, it makes no sense to take it at that dose," is very ambiguous. Does that mean one should take more, or none at all, if symptoms are not relieved?	2017-11-12 22:27:39Z	BillDOe
14236	14272	So, is there something to prevent penis erotic?	2017-11-12 03:57:50Z

14236	14272	I know that i can't remove this desire, but i can beat it if there is no erection.	2017-11-13 19:51:09Z	
14236	14272	No, it is all intertwined, as I explained.  There's not a magic pill that will do what you are asking.  And I do NOT advise trying to psychologically condition yourself not to get an erection, as conditioning is not easy to reverse when you finally ARE in that relationship you are waiting for.  Really, really really see a psychologist to guide you on how to HEALTHILY approach this.	2017-11-14 06:29:38Z	DoctorWhom
14184	14217	This is a great long answer with lots of references. You have not provided an answer for zinc without sun exposure. My understanding from the link in my question is that it is the sun light hitting the zinc oxide particles is what breaks them down.  Why would I need to reapply a zinc sun blocker, if it has not been exposed to sweat or sun?	2017-11-04 22:17:09Z	
14184	14217	This is the part where I was struggling to find references for. I don’t know whether the sunlight hitting zinc oxide breaks it down and couldn’t find any studies regarding that. I’ll keep researching though. However, a small amount of nanoparticles of zinc oxide is absorbed by the skin, and because all dermatological professionals and researchers have recommended a) to use physical sunscreen and b) to renew sunscreen every two hours, I assumed the two-hour regulation still holds for phys. sunscreen	2017-11-04 22:27:20Z	Narusan-in-coma
14184	14217	[cont‘d] Also, whilst you aren’t under direct exposure of the sun, you still are indirectly exposed to light from the sun indoors. Even UVA still passes through windows. The blogger never clarified whether zinc oxide is broken down by UVA, UVB or lower-energy EM waves such as the visible spectrum of the light.	2017-11-04 22:30:40Z	Narusan-in-coma
14184	14217	Honestly, I‘m as dissatisfied with my findings as you are. But I‘ve spent so much time researching I thought I‘d still scramble all what I did find into a neat small answer. Maybe someone else picks it up from where I was. I will keep on researching myself as well. I‘ve checked PubMeD, PubChem for studies regarding the breakdown of zinc oxide on the skin and couldn’t find anything, and google searches or DuckDuckGo searches didn’t provide me with good sources. // Right now, I‘ll call it a day and enjoy my sleep (it’s pretty late here)	2017-11-04 22:33:50Z	Narusan-in-coma
14184	14217	Yeah, definitely don’t use zinc oxide nanoparticles. I‘ll read through this study tomorrow and have found this study stating that zinc does get absorbed by the skin	2017-11-04 22:46:49Z	Narusan-in-coma
14183	14206	Basically, 8 degree Celsius is the amount where body heat would be self-sustainable, if I understand correctly? Might be worth explaining where the formula comes from.	2017-11-03 17:35:31Z	Narusan-in-coma
14183	14206	But if my home was 8 C, I would probably wear more clothing and wrap a blanket around me. Honestly, there are people who work outside for 8-10 hours a day at -20 and they wear heavy coats, hats, gloves, boots etc but they get by.	2017-11-03 18:00:35Z	Kate Gregory
14183	14206	I notice from that link that a person will be at thermal equilibrium (which I believe means comfortable, a much more difficult bar to meet than "not damaging yourself" at -28 C if they are wrapped in a polar duvet.	2017-11-03 18:02:59Z	Kate Gregory
14183	14206	@KateGregory you need to achieve equilibrium in order to not damage yourself. If you are willing to add enough insulation, then you can live in whatever temperature you are faced with. The key is to adjust the calories you burn (P) and the insulation you wear (R) to achieve equilibrium with the temperature (T) that you live in.	2017-11-03 18:13:28Z	StrongBad

14152	14154	Although honey can be potentially used to treat wounds on live tissues, placing it next to teeth which do not have regenerating cells on their outer layer is probably not a good idea. Keep in mind that the oral cavity is constantly washed by salive when awake,which would dissolve any sugar including honey to sub therapeutic levels, feeding instead of killing the bacterias.	2018-02-18 01:56:36Z	enap_mwf
14152	14154	@enap_mwf Well, skeptical as I am on this too, these honeys are not just sugar  as therapeutic agent, osmotic pressure etc. Curiously it's just the diluting of ordinary honey that produces H2O2 and with Manuka there are additional active substances.	2018-02-18 02:07:41Z	LangLangC

14075	14077	So, just to be sure I understand you correctly, it IS possible to get both calcium AND iron from food items, as long as the calcium is not in the form of calcium carbonate.

14075	14077	@GrahamChiu Yes, but we need to consider vegans here as the problem is also getting enough calcium from vegetables. Getting the RDA for calcium from only vegetables (so, including the calcium added in tofu is cheating) is quite difficult, but it has been suggested that this may be due to the RDA being chosen too high. See e.g. this video where a large amount of healthy vegan foods gets you to just below 800 mg of calcium.	2017-10-23 00:02:37Z	Count Iblis

14008	14021	Thanks for the answer. Although I'm not sure what you mean by "though a lack of efficient chlorination is Mumbai's problem". Do you mean that they chlorinate it, but don't do so properly?	2017-10-18 08:41:43Z	
14008	14021	I don't think I've read this article before. "C ward, which includes areas such as Pydhonie and Bhuleshwar, was revealed as the area receiving the dirtiest water from taps." Unfortunately, we're C ward.	2017-10-18 08:44:45Z

13989	13992	@Don_S That was my assumption, but I didn’t want to give a Guide kn how to commit suicide to other visitors of the site without the disclaimer at the top. You’re welcome!	2017-10-17 04:50:11Z	Narusan-in-coma
13987	13996	Thanks. Aside from the risk of frostbite, can exceeding the recommended icing time for ice application delay healing?	2017-10-16 16:10:35Z	
13987	13996	This article suggests that topical cooling or icing would delay healing. But, that is not true if there is compression and elevation as well. The purpose is to split rice in exact proportions, overdoing any of the three would hamper the healing process.	2017-10-16 17:22:27Z	Kon Hai Woh
13984	13985	Thanks for caring, I've stopped using recently. However, your answer doesn't provide any information about eyes becoming smaller.	2017-10-16 14:19:51Z	
13984	13985	@DXMLover That's good to hear. I am not aware of anything that will make the eye as such literally smaller, but dizziness, lack of sleep and dilated pupols can add to the effect of a perceived small eye, as I stated in my answer. Maybe if you specify what you mean by eye (retina, iris etc.) I can go into a bit more detail...	2017-10-16 14:51:54Z	Narusan-in-coma
13973	13997	Thank you so much! I have a few questions. Does the route of administration change the results, apart from the timing and length of the experience? Is CBD the second most psychotropic ingredient in cannabis? Is it available for recreational use? How is the mental experience?	2017-10-16 19:58:53Z	
13973	13997	@Asmani Pure CBD has no psychoactive effects.	2017-10-17 01:54:11Z	Carey Gregory
13973	13997	@Asmani - Recreational use will solely depend upon where you live as each state has its own marijuana laws. In the USA cannabis is illegal on a federal level. The way cannabis is used or in your words, "route of administration" can change the results. For example; smoking and digesting the same strain and same amounts of cannabis can have vastly different outcomes. Someone may smoke .5 grams and have an altered state of mind, whereas  digesting .5 grams may have no obvious impact at all. The mental and physical experiences are completely individual to each person.	2017-10-17 08:12:00Z	d.ariane

13965	13998	Okay just edited it!	2017-10-18 00:36:32Z	veritessa
13956	13975	Agreed, but I can't upvote because by only including that study, it seems that you're advocating a 600 kcal diet as the solution - which I don't think was your intention.  The evidence is strong for certain dietary paradigm shifts, like the whole food plant based diet as discussed in the other answer, so perhaps broadening your answer would help clarify what you mean.	2017-10-15 09:00:33Z	DoctorWhom
13956	13975	Neil Barnard's studies on whole foods as a whole when I read them a few years ago did not reverse diabetes but may have lead to increased diabetic control. The Newcastle diet replicates the period of near starvation following gastric bypass surgery that leads to reversal of diabetes without the unnecessary surgery. The physiological mechanism is as I explained. And yes, a 800 kcal diet does work in selected patients. A large UK trial is now testing this.	2017-10-16 09:59:37Z	Graham Chiu
13956	13975	These other half hearted diets don't work generally because they don't reverse the underlying pathology which is hepatic glucose sensitivity, and steatosis. The diet doesn't fix peripheral insulin resistance. That likely needs aerobic exercise.	2017-10-16 10:03:35Z	Graham Chiu
13956	13975	Maybe, when it's in beta.	2017-10-22 23:21:17Z	Graham Chiu
13956	13975	@GrahamChiu Trouble is, we won’t get to beta unless we have knowledgeable supporters. You could „just follow“ the proposal and maybe read and upvote 5 questions you deem worthy. That shouldn’t take too much of your time away and would be a huge step towards beta. I‘m really looking forward to read your Q&A‘s in the beta phase!	2017-10-26 09:07:51Z	Narusan-in-coma
13956	13977	Might be an entertaining watch. Videos are often just a waste of time. Any written stuff to back that up? Also, Barnard is an ideologue: ncahf.org/articles/o-r/pcrm.html wondering: that much talking and activism, how much time to read and research?	2017-10-15 11:18:16Z	LangLangC
13956	13977	@LangLangC There is a LOT of solid evidence for the potential of whole food plant based diet + exercise (especially involving weight loss) to have an enormous impact on diabetes; it's not just Neil Barnard.  I can't say one way or another about Neil specifically, but your article from NCAHF is 20 years old...  Evidence has grown exponentially since then.	2017-10-15 15:25:14Z	DoctorWhom
13956	13977	Also this is what we see in clinical practice.  The ACLM and ACPM are professional organizations whose websites are great resources for references.	2017-10-15 15:27:34Z	DoctorWhom
13956	13977	I want to see a prospective trial of a vegan diet that is isocaloric with the patient's previous diet to treat diabetes. I predict that there will be zero cases of reversal T2DM despite Barnard says because that's what the evidence says to date.	2017-10-16 18:59:45Z	Graham Chiu
13956	13977	ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677007 74 weeks of vegan diet.  All falls in HbA1c correspond to weight loss.	2017-10-26 03:33:23Z	Graham Chiu
13956	14058	+1 Although (currently) not enough backup in references and a bit lopsided in its 'radicalism'. E.g. weight loss, calorie restriction, & exercise all can play a role here. Reading it with the other answers (& comments, alas) does round off the picture. You're most invited to earn more rep and maybe expand this answer.	2017-10-21 17:43:33Z	LangLangC

13956	14058	@TomMercer although I agree that insulin sensitivity is a spectrum, a number of your assertions are not clearly supported with evidence. Even your linked references do not support your assertion that sugar intake is the prime culprit over obesity.   Yes, I have seen evidence supporting the theory that insulin spikes from high carb intake CONTRIBUTES to insulin resistance, but it was never asserted to be a greater factor than obesity itself.	2017-10-26 01:56:53Z	DoctorWhom

13953	13968	@LangLangC It is catchy, but useless as why not just evaporating plain alcohol. Why would you want to keep the alcohol evaporating from a solid source. But generally few people know that they can evaporate alcohol through hookah with a special bowl, also it could be more efficient, cause of the water filtration/cooling it goes through	2017-10-15 16:26:10Z	SmokyPerson
13941	13942	Did you mean mg/ml?	2017-10-12 14:59:52Z	
13941	13942	You said "ng/ml". It should be "m" instead of "n".	2017-10-12 16:41:29Z	
13941	13942	@RohanBhowmik I said the standard unit is mg/ml, but I've also seen nanogram (ng) per millilitre with a link to a source using nano litres.	2017-10-12 19:56:36Z	Narusan-in-coma
13941	13942	Okay, that is what you meant. Thanks!	2017-10-13 02:45:19Z

13926	14124	It is impossible to pick a "winner" between these two high quality answers, thank you both! I decided to accept your answer because it differentiates between temporary and long term hypoxia, which is most likely a key factor. I will assign the bounty to @Taylor's answer for the detailed explanation of the relationship between hypoxia and cancer.	2017-10-29 10:53:02Z	
13926	14117	Quite a broadside you dealt there. Although good ones, these are not direct but circumstantial evidence based reasons/indications. Have you considered that Hof-hypoxia might be much shorter in duration and whether it's more or less systemic than what your sources investigate? Does high-altitude 'hypoxia' increase cancer risk? / As a sidenote: I like longer answers, some on SE do not.	2017-10-26 10:46:57Z	LangLangC
13926	14117	The duration of WH breathing does not seem to be regulated, as wording such as “around”, “as long as you can” & “can be repeated” are used in the instructions listed on the WHM website. For any health practice that suggests self-induced modification of the ABCs, there ought to be more finite guidelines. In high-altitude hypoxia, beneficial effects on health have been documented, however, UV radiation levels & air pollution are also found to be contributing factors.	2017-10-26 19:34:27Z	Taylor
13926	14117	Agreed. WH breathing should be better defined. Much. But he and his method are on the far side of science anyway. However this also has to be somewhat self-limited. Passing out or similar effects bring the meditative portion to an end. // Have you found people claiming to do this all the time? That would indeed change my assessment fundamentally.	2017-10-26 20:03:59Z	LangLangC
13926	14117	@LangLangC Could you please clarify what you mean by "all the time"? I've found forum and blog posts from people claiming to do WH breathing multiple times per day for several days at a time. Would links to these posts suffice?	2017-10-26 22:08:15Z	Taylor
13926	14117	That would be interesting. Sufficiency to be determined. Might strengthen your point. I thought of such extremists trying to do this every hour or almost constantly on end. People can be, – you know. Multiple times is quite a lot already imho.	2017-10-26 23:06:43Z	LangLangC

13902	13904	The German Red Cross Society still recommends rescue breaths, and mouth-to-mouth CPR is taught in first aid courses. However, if you fear that you’re endangering yourself, don’t do rescue breaths and resort to chest compression. Doing something is always better than doing nothing!	2017-10-09 08:09:26Z	Narusan-in-coma
13902	13904	France does the same as Germany. Guidelines basically say that mouth-to-mouth (or mouth-to-nose in certain cases) is still recommended (but in total obstruction cases of course), but should not be performed in case of risk (blood), fear or strong disgust.	2017-10-10 14:22:54Z	Shlublu

13876	13878	Hi @Dan I understand where you're coming from, I am too.  This site works a little differently than other sites; citations are given (1) so people can look up more info (2) to demonstrate validity of source, since no one can prove their credentials here.  I love UTD but try to link to something from AAFP AAP etc or Medscape NIH CDC .edu and other resources so others can look at it.  Or I pull out the citation that UTD cites for it.	2017-10-07 15:13:21Z	DoctorWhom
13876	13878	Also @Dan it usually only takes 30 seconds or so to find a link to the thing you already know.  Other times a little longer.  Now and then for something less tangible, like "what is the flow in the ER" types of things, I have just had to say "source: clinical experience" or lectures or conversations with colleagues, and then it can be taken with a grain of salt.

13875	13881	Great answer. What would happen in the U.S. if you travel to the hospital yourself? Can they refuse to aid you? Will they send an ambulance with you to the next trauma centre?	2017-10-05 20:59:28Z	Narusan-in-coma
13875	13881	@Narusan-in-coma They cannot refuse to treat anyone under federal law. However, in the situation described in the question they would stabilize and transfer them by ambulance (or air) to a trauma center as soon as possible.	2017-10-05 21:54:35Z	Carey Gregory

13862	13865	Can you please cite some source or at least post some proof giving a good reason why androgen receptors deserve to exist in dermal cells? They promote foul odors, unwanted hair growth (inviting pathogenic bacteria through higher surface area to volume ratio), and acne while inhibiting wound healing. Sounds like an obvious no-brainer if there ever was one. Bear in mind that the treatment would only affect skin cells.	2017-10-04 14:21:52Z	
13862	13865	@user1258361 Deserve to exist? Are you serious?	2017-10-05 04:10:59Z	Carey Gregory
13862	13865	Ancient Chinese idiom/proverb "Hua Shih Tian Zhu" - translates to "Drawing a Snake and Adding Legs". The moral of the proverb is that if you add irrelevant garbage to an otherwise OK product, only bad things can happen to it. Androgen receptors on skin cells (and the damaging health effects) are a premier example of this principle.	2017-10-31 22:01:40Z	
13862	13865	@user1258361 Thx for the tidbit. Preferring the Greeks I'll add: "There were two brothers called Both and Either; perceiving Either was a good, understanding, busy fellow, and Both a silly fellow and good for little, Philip said, "Either is both, and Both is neither."	2017-11-02 09:11:21Z	LangLangC

13858	13866	I wish that WebMD article cited sources.  There is quite a bit of contradictory information presented.  They claim on one page that people take it for illnesses such as depression.  Then on another page they claim it can increase depression.  Similarly, they claim people take it for auto-immune diseases, but on another page they claim it can inhibit the auto-immune system.  I don't see any sources for their claims.	2017-10-04 19:13:19Z

This is the case for two reasons: a) I have done my best to research and couldn't really find anything citable (PubMed obviously has no meaningful studies on this) and b) it's a very basic topic even taught in first aid courses, so I think that I can get away with my low amount of references.	2017-10-01 20:10:06Z	Narusan-in-coma
13830	13832	Yes this is an example of when fewer references are needed, it's a basic definition type of question and the answer's done well.	2017-10-04 03:15:40Z	DoctorWhom

13824	13825	Modern CT scanners have much lower doses of radiation due to faster scanning times, and better software.  Location of scans also depends, and also the type of CT scan .. eg. HRCT.	2017-10-07 21:09:17Z	Graham Chiu

13819	13821	@InStReSs If you are really that worried, I’d recommend that you read a book about pregnancy and human fertility. Getting pregnant is difficult (as I have told you in my answer), and there are no pregnancies “by accident”. “By accident” means someone didn’t wear a condom, and this does not happen on accident. Also, condoms don’t rupture. That’s a myth. // Go to your library and get a book. It never hurts to educate oneself, and it’s always good to know the body processes of the opposite gender.	2017-10-04 13:22:44Z	Narusan-in-coma
13819	13821	@InStReSs - Comments are for clarifying answers or questions. They are not for badgering or introducing several "what if" scenarios. I would highly suggest you go talk to a professional. There is no way for us to reassure you over every possible scenario.	2017-10-04 14:33:47Z	JohnP
13819	13821	@InStReSs - As I said. Go talk to someone about it. This is not anything that we can reassure you on beyond what we already have.	2017-10-04 15:51:00Z	JohnP
13819	13821	@InStReSs We have told you everything we can. Please talk to someone about your mental instability and educate yourself in how pregnancy works. You are saying you don't have the time, but later on write that you can't think straight anymore. Set your priorities right. This is my final word, there's nothing more we can do. Thank you for understanding and respecting this.	2017-10-04 16:09:35Z	Narusan-in-coma
13819	13821	Condoms can and do break/rupture. Please do not present misconceptions as fact. Vasectomies and tubal ligations have been known to still allow pregnancies. There are many accidental pregnancies using all different kinds of birth control.	2017-10-04 16:39:37Z	JohnP
13811	13823	Interesting study, haven't come across that one before. However, your answer doesn't address "heart disease", and could arguably be fleshed out a bit more. If you edit it a bit, you'll definitely have my +1.	2017-09-30 22:04:56Z	Narusan-in-coma
13806	13816	That actually sounds quite possible (although, obviously, I will ask my doctor) as I already suffer from quite hectic myoclonic jerks. They occur throughout my body and I sometimes lose consciousness for a second or two.	2017-10-02 12:00:08Z	
13800	13810	+1, good answer. Saying that, I’m not promoting ... life-threatening. You might want to use markdown to make this part stand out, that’s really important!	2017-09-29 17:07:40Z	Narusan-in-coma

13796	7159	I have to go out and say, I am not a professional. In fact, I did not know what computer glasses were before I answered this. I think computer glasses will prevent future complications.

13737	13749	The test shows allergy in general but it didn't resolve the problem. It says air allergy and some sort of foods which is of tartness...	2017-09-23 01:41:57Z	
13737	13749	We cannot carry an air purifier always as it is not possible in reality	2017-09-23 01:42:28Z	
13737	13749	In allergy testing, there is no test that says "allergy in general."  If your doctor did testing without telling you what to do about it, go back to the doctor for an interpretation and treatment plan.  There are medications (from nasal sprays to pills) that help reduce reactions to environmental allergies.  But your doc needs to tell you what your individual issue is.	2017-09-23 02:26:11Z	DoctorWhom
13737	13749	However @Narusan food logging is actually what we DO recommend people do when they can't pinpoint which item in their food is causing allergy symptoms because it isn't always necessary to go to food allergen testing if it's easy to identify by diary.  But since he said wheezing, I agree that he should go straight to testing. I might recommend editing your question to say "Go straight to a doctor if a food causes you wheezing or any other sign/symptom of anaphylaxis like eye/lip or throat swelling, difficulty breathing etc." They can test you without having to ingest the food and risk dying.	2017-09-23 02:33:20Z	DoctorWhom

13735	13739	@Kevin: The part about "Is that thinking correct? Probably not." seems to be specific to the part about secretions; this answer seems to support avoiding milk to avoid binding the antibiotic in the gut. (If so, the answer could use some rearrangement to make its position clearer.)	2017-09-22 05:36:31Z	user2357112
13735	13739	@Kevin - Your medic may well be wrong, just repeating an opinion handed down to her and originated goodness knows where. On the other hand, she may by accident be right. What would you lose by staying off milk products for a few days? A little bit of enjoyment, that's all. And continuing to consume milk at your normal rate may diminish the effect of the antibiotics. If you're ill, you need to make sacrifices to get better. Not drinking milk or eating ice cream for a few days isn't a big sacrifice. Try soya milk maybe?	2017-09-22 09:18:42Z	ruffle
13735	13739	And, just to point out how important it is to look at the actual preparation taken (and its acompanying information): there are antibiotics of the tetracycline-class now that can be taken with milk: the tablet actually contains a precursor/prodrug that is not inactivated by milk (more precisely: divalent cations), and which is metabolized into the active antibiotic later on.	2017-09-22 11:31:19Z	cbeleites
13735	13739	@ruffle - opinions which are supported by studies are good ones.Opinions that are not supported by the literature are not helpful. "On the other hand, she may by accident be right." This is kind of a nonsensical approach to medicine. Medicine is a science, not a repository of old wives tales.	2017-09-22 13:29:46Z	anongoodnurse
13735	13739	@DanBryant - There are other studies of the effect of milk on asthma. Initially it was done thinking "secretion problem", but milk only affected a relatively small subset of asthmatics, and that was allergy induced, and yes, it affected secretions in this subset. Did that answer your question? If you want more information, you can always post a question. :) But I can't guarantee you an answer. Increasing flow of mucus is tricky, because increased production and increased flow are two different things. You want to increase flow (but not production) in order to get rid of it.	2017-09-22 15:09:55Z	anongoodnurse
13735	13736	I don't have my medicine on hand to check while I'm at work, but I believe that I'm on Amoxicillin Clavulanate, not Tetracycline. Does your answer still apply?	2017-09-21 18:20:14Z	
13735	13736	It's still recommended that either an anti-emetic or milk can help with it staying down. Amoxicillin does not fall under this directly, however I asked a colleague and he agreed it's best to avoid dairy for GI complications.	2017-09-21 18:29:22Z	cloudnyn3
13735	13736	That makes sense. Thanks for asking your colleague for me! :)	2017-09-21 18:35:12Z	
13735	13736	This answer is wrong in so very many ways. I don't understand the upvotes. First, it only addresses tetracycline. Second, gastroparesis is a condition that makes tetracycline a bit more dangerous to take. Third, it doesn't address yogurt consumption.	2017-09-21 21:39:56Z	anongoodnurse
13735	13736	He asked about dairy products and antibiotic combination. Nothing I stated was wrong. Hence why I posted a link	2017-09-21 22:00:23Z	cloudnyn3

13723	13776	Thank you, that is a neat study. Where did you see that they evaluated CelGro? I couldn't see a mention of it. It looks  very similar though.	2017-09-25 21:32:18Z	
13723	13776	From the methods section: "The reconstituted collagen scaffolds were made from highly-purified, type I collagen from bovine tendons using proprietary methods (Collagen Matrix, Inc., Oakland, New Jersey). The collagen fibers were processed to create a highly oriented and highly porous (85–90% porosity) collagen scaffold with a DNA content of less than 50 ng/mg. The scaffolds were freeze-dried after processing and rehydrated at the time of surgery22. The rehydrated scaffold dimensions were approximately 15 mm wide, 30 mm long, and 2 mm thick."	2017-09-25 21:32:28Z

13722	13752	Thank you for adding the CDC link. Without it I would have had to downvote your answer. The problem with citing professional experience here is that we have no way of verifying it. Anybody can claim to be a brain surgeon, after all, and if they talk a good game, who's going to be the wiser?	2017-09-23 01:31:37Z	Carey Gregory
13722	13752	@CareyGregory I tried my best, this question and many other questions on this site cannot be addressed without clinical experience. People think they can "shop" for healthcare. But really the decision for selecting a product will be a decision that the vaccine administrator will make. I strongly advise talking to whoever is giving the vaccine and seek their opinion instead of trying to find a recommendation online. Leave it to the professionals. If you do not believe in the one that you go to, seek another one that meets your expectations.	2017-09-23 03:29:47Z	shnisaka
13713	13714	Great. Although the link to "Sources stating it might be worse than tobacco" strikes me as odd. I read that link as "as bad as." – It is also a bit fundamentalist. While smoke-free is a worth-while goal, that one discounts the very likely reduced risks (even if small) it itself has to report.	2017-09-20 17:54:54Z	LangLangC
13713	13714	@LangLangC Now that I re-read that section, I think a better headline would be "sources stating it's as bad as nicotine patches or worse when looking for a substitute to cigarettes". Do you agree?	2017-09-20 18:02:34Z

13713	13724	Thanks for the edit, and I'll make an effort to find cites.  Although my aim was not to prove anything (which cites alone do not in any case) but rather further @Narusan-in-coma answer in illustrating the near impossible complexity of distilling any body of research in inhalation into "healtheir" or "not".  Burning tobacco has hundreds if not thousands of components with toxicological interest, and those alone takes no account of the synergistic effects of the entire bolus.  Or even how an inhaled product is consumed - things like puff profile, flame cone temperature, and lung retention...	2017-09-21 23:20:40Z	SteveRacer
13713	13724	Great answer! And welcome to Health. It’s unfair how HNQ distorts the upvotes of questions, your answer deserves a lot more! Thanks for adding the sources.	2017-09-22 05:57:43Z

13698	13699	We have had a conversation with her psychiatrist, as well as her OB. Her OB appears to think nothing is wrong, and her psychiatrist seemed to only be concerned with the clonazepam, but in a very wishywashy way. Giving vague statements about what could go wrong, and also saying that staying on the medication could be better because she would be less anxious (she is on this medication as an anti anxiety, and has pretty powerful anxiety attacks) he ended with telling us that we need to do some research. I am here because I am unable to interpret these studies, not being a doctor.	2017-09-20 09:54:00Z	
13698	13699	I'm sorry they couldn't help.  And I understand your position.  But it's a personal advice request, and we may not be able to answer that further here for a number of reasons.   health.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/747/… If you feel the doc's answer was insufficient, you should continue it with them or see someone else.	2017-09-20 13:58:39Z	DoctorWhom

13698	13699	@Patrick - If you give us a study, we can read it and interpret it for you. Ask a separate question for each paper, and cite a whole paper, not just an abstract. If you can't get the whole paper, the abstract will have to do.	2017-09-20 14:43:08Z	anongoodnurse
13698	13699	@doctorwhom, I apologise, I have been rude. After reading the question in your comment I now understand what the problem with this question is. It is intensely frustrating to be in a situation like this. I will do more research and ask what are hopefully better questions.	2017-09-20 17:07:52Z	
13693	13710	Excellent. But if we overstep from "more than enough to prevent deficiency" over the "the upper limit of beneficial" with "more protein" (2nd intent of mine) then what happens?	2017-09-21 22:00:05Z	
13693	13710	@LangLangC - Absent any disease state, you put a little extra strain on the kidneys, and if puts you over your caloric count for the day, you risk it being stored as fat. A few things I've read suggest it may have a detrimental effect on bone health long term and a couple other similar minor impacts, but I cannot confirm that.	2017-09-22 14:40:26Z	JohnP

13668	15314	And another +1 for " if diagnosis were as simple as that, then a computer would do it"  The OP is talking about the differential diagnosis process basically, and there are programs like Diagnosaurus and Isobel and VisualDx that can generate a wide list of differential diagnoses based on some signs and symptoms - but that list is not very useful unless you have the training to work through the differential and determine what is likely/unlikely and concerning/reassuring.

13656	13670	One more question. I think the burning option my have the most potential for my purposes. Is this something one could do to oneself with a waffle iron, presuming one was particularly stupid and/or intoxicated? I have read online that waffle irons generally cook at 300 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Is that enough heat for a severe 2nd degree burn?	2017-09-18 17:08:57Z	
13656	13670	It's temperature and time dependent. Yes, that's hot enough to take less than a second.  For your purposes, make sure the character has solid contact with it not just barely brushing against it.  Like if the lid falls down onto their hand, they'd have to push it or pull it back open - that's enough time and pressure both.  If it crosses their knuckles, it'd require significant bandaging and likely bracing.  I'd stick with at least mostly second degree , maybe with some areas of third if you want, bc large third degrees may require skin grafts and are more complicated.	2017-09-18 19:03:52Z	DoctorWhom
13656	13670	That's pretty much the answer I was hoping for. I'm going for the kind of incident that's over almost before you realize what's going on, and then you have no choice but to deal with the results. So, less than a second of actual waffle-iron contact is pretty optimal. Thanks again for your help. I think I have a much better idea of where my story is going, now.	2017-09-18 20:33:55Z	
13656	13661	This could be good. I was under the impression that a fracture took longer than that to heal, but perhaps I was thinking of a proper break. And there are any number of embarrassing things that could cause an unusual amount of pressure to be applied to a wrist or arm.	2017-09-17 03:18:23Z	
13656	13661	@Narusan-in-coma Actually, fractures all take longer to heal than 2 weeks.  I'm not sure if sometimes they remove a cast in 2 weeks but I've never seen it.  A wrist (e.g. ulna or radius) is usually 4-6 weeks.  It's only 2-3 weeks by the time you have to have a thick soft callus form.	2017-09-17 04:25:38Z	DoctorWhom

13649	13650	@Mike-DHSc great question!  It's not commonly done here in the US but should be, IMHO, since Narusan is correct. But I think for time shortage reasons we often don't.  I do it manually now and then to verify a particularly high or low reading before making significant changes in meds etc.	2017-09-15 06:14:40Z	DoctorWhom
13649	13650	@Narusan-in-coma a couple things to add: among the reasons for difference between R and L are the most common atherosclerosis (or muscular spasms) and less common but serious ascending aortic dissection.  If suspecting dissection, that's one test that's easy to do before sending for CT.  But it's pretty rare, so don't worry that is the reason your SBP are different - like you said, it's normal to vary.	2017-09-15 06:16:35Z	DoctorWhom

13647	13659	Just a quick comment on "health care setting, medical world: still almost never, as a substitute..." it is actually considered appropriate to correctly use a correct amount of hand sanitizer before/after most patient interactions.  You should wash if anything gets on your hands, e.g. body fluid or skin oils etc (for which gloves should've been used). But for normal contacts, it is at this time not considered necessary.  There is some discussion that you should wash after 5-10 sanitizer applications, but the WHO states otherwise   here: who.int/gpsc/tools/faqs/abhr2/en	2017-09-17 10:42:14Z	DoctorWhom
13647	13659	You are correct. Maybe I oversimplified my wording there: I wanted to emphasise the "in place"/substitute aspect. The "correctly use" is also underexposed.	2017-09-17 11:38:46Z	LangLangC
13647	13652	Might also add that hand sanitizers with triclosan should be avoided.	2017-09-15 21:21:52Z	BillDOe
13642	13645	Is "Sanguineous Crust" still in active use in the medical community? I found search hits for that term in references to old medical terms and in an excerpt from a medical text published in 1845.	2017-09-14 20:06:05Z	
13642	13645	Very typically it is simply written by as "crust" or "scab".  As most of these words are of greek / latin origin it is very common that you'll see it referenced as an "old" medical term.  Simply put in a patients chart you would still very commonly see "scab", however "Sanguineous Crust" is the most precise term.	2017-09-14 20:08:10Z	Mike-DHSc
13642	13645	Is this for a class - or what is the exact need for this information?  In a practical sense the term scab is 1. short (we love short words, abbreviations lol) 2. widely understood. Adding "Sanguineous" to the word makes this overly complex.  As reimbursement is decided by people much less versed in medical terminology, you'd actually be doing them a disservice.  They will not likely know what the long overly complex term "Sanguineous Crust" means	2017-09-14 20:18:44Z	Mike-DHSc
13642	13645	I asked this same question in med school because it sounds so colloquial.  Sanguinous crust is correct.  Or just crust.  But internal doesn't make as much sense, so I'm not sure what you're defining as scab?	2017-09-15 02:28:36Z	DoctorWhom
13642	13645	@Mike-DHSc Ah yes wound is the correct term for the tissue that is damaged/healing at the site of injury (or intentional like in surgery). On the inside the same process of coagulated blood might be called a hematoma, collection of coagulated blood;  It happens a little differently inside but is the same general coagulation process.	2017-09-15 06:56:40Z	DoctorWhom
13628	13629	Can it spread so easily below the gum line?	2017-09-14 00:56:46Z	
13628	13629	Also, what do you mean by "I hate these probes"? Did you mean that you hate the instrument? If so, you don't say why.	2017-09-14 01:36:37Z	
13628	13629	Well, I've seen visible matter (to call it that; really food leftovers, discoloured, almost fermented) pulled out of there. If it's not (re-)pushed in like that with a probe (which would open up quite some other problems): yes it spreads quite easily.  Any noticeable infection means the unwanted bacteria are locally  in such a high concentration that the odds are now generally on their side. Looking at them with a probe doesn't give them significant advantages above those they already have. The gum line isn't closed tight enough for bacteria to not be able to slip in.	2017-09-14 01:37:20Z	LangLangC
13628	13629	"Hate them" since I find it really uncomfortable. But I get upset when just seeing someone else's eyes and gum lines  examined. Was that "hate" misleading in my answer?	2017-09-14 01:40:31Z	LangLangC
13628	13629	I thought perhaps you meant to type "I hate these questions" or something since you didn't say what you hated about the instrument.	2017-09-14 01:42:33Z	
13624	13640	At my second visit to the wound specialist, I asked them specifically about granulation tissue being the problem. The PA was kind enough to confirm what you're saying here, especially about the excess tissue being the removal target. I think @langlangc was after the same idea with hypergranulation, but your explanation of the "dance" is a more helpful answer to my question about the biologic process. Thanks!	2017-09-21 18:36:37Z	
13624	13627	No offense taken. Thanks for the links, I’m assuming that hypergranulation tissue is what they’re treating. This at least gives me a starting place for understanding what is going on in my body.	2017-09-13 22:28:26Z	
13624	13627	@voxobscuro Just fyi if you're having delayed healing, make sure you get checked for diabetes etc and stop smoking, those are 2 major causes for delayed wound healing.	2017-09-14 03:36:48Z	DoctorWhom
13624	13627	@LangLangC great answer, but OP is also asking about the delayed healing.  Perhaps add a bit on that.  Welcome btw, thrilled to have you here, great answers so far!	2017-09-14 03:39:34Z	DoctorWhom
13624	13627	@DoctorWhom thanks, I think that’s good advice. I’m not a smoker (of any kind) and I believe I was checked for diabetes this summer along with a bunch of other endocrine and immune system tests. I’ll verify that though.	2017-09-14 04:18:41Z	
13610	13778	Thanks so much for this @Mike-DHSc (+1) - so in layman's terms (I'm a software guy, so a lot of the above is greek to me!) when I do a bicep curl, it feels like someone is stabbing my cubital fossa (elbow "pit"?!). After a few sets + reps, the pain goes away entirely (but only temporarily). My theory is that my Cubital Tunnel Syndrome (I was diagnosed by a neurologist a few years back before I had symptoms) is causing the pain but that doing a few sets of curls somehow pumps blood into "the right places" and relieves whatever compression/pain might be going on. Any thoughts/insights there?	2017-10-09 09:15:59Z	
13573	13675	+1: Great answer and excellent references	2017-09-17 14:57:48Z	Narusan-in-coma
13572	13754	Your second source seems behind a paywall and the abstract is beautifully uninformative for the question at hand. Could you expand what you read there and cite a bit more?	2017-09-23 16:40:30Z	LangLangC
13572	13754	Certainly. Here is the relevant table from the  Kitasako et al. paper: i.imgur.com/fBfgOYq.png  EP group = erosion positive; EN = erosion negative.  The analysis of associated factors is in table 5 here: i.imgur.com/6BOAhlV.png	2017-09-25 01:32:13Z	sergiouribe
13572	13754	Hm, that paper: I suspect that they used the American definition of "carbonated soft drinks" -> including things like coke under that label. It is further unclear how just adding CO2 to H2O could be that influential. Do you agree in reading that table as carbonated drinks being the weakest erosive agent?	2017-09-25 12:15:40Z	LangLangC
13564	13567	Beautifully answered @KateGregory with the "There are things you can do beyond that, but they are not dietary and should probably be suggested by someone more familiar with your personal situation"and "if you are ill or are taking any medication......" - - Copied for future answers :)	2017-09-09 02:24:19Z	DoctorWhom
13564	13567	The question is specific to Dietary interactions that could cause constipation. In the above scenario consuming 'enough' fibre or water does not help. in this case, constipation is caused specifically when eating a meal High in Starch and rich in Meat. Here, constipation is not experienced when eating only Rice or eating only meat.	2017-09-09 06:16:01Z	
13564	13567	Sorry but that is just not a thing. I can't find medical studies to prove a negative, but combining starch and protein is literally what most people do at every meal and it doesn't make any sense to think they react to form something that constipates you - mostly because there isn't really "something that constipates you" there is the absence of something that helps things move along as normal.	2017-09-09 12:33:27Z	Kate Gregory
13564	13567	I assure you that this is a real thing. And maybe this issue is not well studied. Can you think of any 'systemic' issue that would indirectly be causing this. Rice is digested into glucose, and meat is digested into amino acids / fatty acids. Is there some systemic issue that could cause constipation when there is a surge of glucose and amino acids / fatty acids in the blood as the same time ?	2017-09-10 12:52:55Z

13542	13543	I just thought that maybe the soles are specially designed for running and might not be that suitable for prolonged walking, such as seemingly suggested by this article verywell.com/can-you-wear-running-shoes-for-walking-3436327. For example, the specific part of your foot that touches the ground first might differ when running compared with walking. But indeed perhaps those differences are minimal and too professional to make a difference.	2017-09-07 16:57:04Z

13539	13540	Indeed, even without any medicine said feeling still ensues. I would add "nostalgic" to describe the feeling, but that contains sad/negative nuances and probably just remembering past happy-high-colds. Strangely enough, it's one of the best moods.	2017-09-07 10:23:32Z	
13539	13540	Perhaps on prior use of pseudoephedrine (which as you are aware, works not unlike amphetamine) your mind has correlated pseudo use with having a cold, and through association, you experience a slight mood elevation? Colds typically have a detrimental effect on hedonic capacity, alertness, and psychomotor speed (according to ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22749892 and  ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9854744)	2017-09-10 00:30:40Z

13521	13533	Awesome as usual.  2 things (1) I was actually thinking part of the question was also that since the guard grinds down, what happens to your teeth over the long run? (2) Great that it lacks BPA!  But to clarify, BPA has been shown to exhibit concerning endocrine activity. Basically, regulatory agencies haven't yet been forced to definitively speak against it; one should take into consideration the history of regulatory agencies defining "safety" (e.g. chromium iv)	2017-09-07 10:02:49Z	DoctorWhom

13521	13533	@DoctorWhom The FDA has listed BPA as a toxic chemical but the doses that have so far been reported in products are all below the limit. Thanks, I must have overlooked the wearing-down aspect... I'll expand my answer as soon as I have time.	2017-09-07 10:10:31Z	Narusan-in-coma

13518	13520	@LangLangC As best I can tell from FDA info, labeling something an aroma means it can't do much more than add smell or taste. I think if it's irritating enough to causes skin sensations they'd have to label it more specifically.	2017-09-06 17:23:36Z	Carey Gregory

13518	13563	+1 for an excellent answer, and your last sentence deserves an upvote for itself	2017-09-08 16:02:28Z	Narusan-in-coma
13518	13563	This post seems more like a rant trying to persuade people of a products toxicity and tries to answer things that are not asked missing some of the ingredients.	2017-09-09 15:38:50Z	
13518	13563	Besides, I had to check one reference. At least the the study about PEGs merely states that not enough studies have been concluded to tell that all of PEGs are safe. There is however a table describing that those which have been studied have been concluded safe ie. non-irritant except for when applied to the eyes ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4505343/table/T002	2017-09-09 15:44:29Z	
13518	13563	Many thanks for explaining your downvote. Since it is your question you know obviously best what you asked. Where did I misrepresent said study? It's one opinion concluding that the controversial but pure substance is deemed OK in most cases. But the industry has a documented hard time really using the stuff without impurities. Nobody actually tested the PEG-40 in the actual marketed product. Nobody tested the marketed product scientifically as a whole and we are left with only clues, drawn from theory about the chemicals and empirical reviews, leaving quite a bit of very reasonable doubt.	2017-09-12 07:33:42Z	LangLangC
13508	13510	Amazing answer, thank you @Mike-DHSc! I always am thrilled to see professionals join in. A couple quick things: (1) make sure to a little more clearly specify that this is not a diagnosis, this is information to take into consideration when asking his providers. This site tends to be picky about avoiding diagnosis, for a bunch of reasons (not unique to your answer). (2) You might get asked for references. Reading this it's obvious your background, but people reading may want to know more. If you provide a couple links, it will help meet guidelines :) This brings up a discussion I'm going to -	2017-09-05 03:36:46Z	DoctorWhom
13508	13510	- open in Meta regarding professionals and citing references. I think some professionals have gotten frustrated by the citation/diagnosis thing and drifted away. I did too, since how do you cite your years of education/training/practice? But I think there are some ways we can make it easier to give links to the guidelines etc that underlie practice of medicine/PT/etc, to encourage more to participate long term... If I can get a good response to the meta, we could make it part of the faq for answering questions. /end ramble –	2017-09-05 03:36:54Z	DoctorWhom
13508	13510	Also, you didn't quite answer which provider to see next, which would help your answer to be more guidance than diagnosis/mgmt leaning. I will add another answer for that purpose.  Usually we try to have the answerer edit it to add that if it was omitted. In this case it's probably fine to leave it this way.	2017-09-05 03:42:57Z	DoctorWhom
13508	13510	@DoctorWho thank you for the kind words – they are very much appreciated! (1) Sorry about that. I will edit my post to clearly state it is not a Diagnosis. (2) Understood.  One issue - these are my own personal notes.   I wouldn’t normally share them but I know how frustrating it can be spending years trying to figure out what is wrong.  I added NIH and JOSPT sources either way.	2017-09-05 09:09:54Z	Mike-DHSc
13508	13510	Guys, don't beat yourself up over what you didn't provide! This is actually the most amount of useful information I have received in a while, so thank you so much for that. I will take this with me when I see a professional. I will take on the advice of DoctorWhom and see a non-surgical orthopedic physician. Hopefully I can get to the bottom of this. From what you describe I can comfortably say I have crepitus kness, a slight increase in the valgus vector (my knees poke out when I bend them) but am not sure of the rest. Hopefully the specialist will know more! Thanks again.	2017-09-05 22:46:51Z	
13508	13511	+1 - This is all excellent information - Will reference this in my post as I did not address who to see.	2017-09-05 09:13:12Z	Mike-DHSc
13508	13511	Thank you DoctorWhom. If I could mark 2 answers as correct I would! But I chose Mikes because of his very descriptive diagnosis and strategies that I should be looking out for when seeing a professional. However, I will be taking your advice to see a nonsurgical orthopedic physician, so thank you for that.	2017-09-05 22:51:37Z	
13507	13524	Great answer. Also I want to highlight physical therapy. Almost always after surgery physical therapy is done to rehabilitate, as there is going to be atrophy etc.  Strong muscles help support bones and joints.  Don't do weight-bearing exercise without a doctor or PT's advice!  Follow their instructions!	2017-09-06 07:24:40Z	DoctorWhom

13481	13485	Could vomiting have a positive psychological effect which results in temporary relief? Or could vomiting lead to increased levels of endorphins which achieve this? The reason I believe there's a connection is that in that state, the effect of vomiting seems to be very different from other physical activity.	2017-09-01 05:03:53Z	
13481	13485	@Philipp Yes, it's possible. And as anyone who's ever experienced nausea knows, vomiting will usually make you feel better almost immediately. That could also be a factor.	2017-09-01 14:56:36Z	Carey Gregory
13475	13494	Your answer is a very good and satisfactory one. Just one question: What do you mean by PT?	2017-09-02 15:36:24Z	
13475	13494	PT = Physical Therapist see apta.org/AboutPTs	2017-09-02 16:02:02Z	Mike-DHSc
13475	13494	OK, OK, I understood. :-)	2017-09-02 16:03:48Z	
13473	13490	There are packets of saline rinse solution you can buy at the pharmacy, follow directions on packet. And you can buy distilled water to use so that you don't have to boil water each day.  Just don't contaminate the distilled water container and it can last a wihle. But it's best to avoid non-sterile water, as there have been (albeit extremely rare) cases of people getting serious infections from nasal rinsing with non-sterilized water.	2017-09-04 09:22:22Z	DoctorWhom
13473	13490	But as I said above, it probably is still best to see a doctor for this.  If it is allergic or other kinds of rhinitis, there are several types of medications that can be tried to help, and they can teach you about allergen avoidance.  If there is a physical blockage in your airways that is causing issues, they can find it and fix it.  There are more things on the list than that, but that's why I suggest seeking a doctor to diagnose and treat it.	2017-09-04 09:27:01Z	DoctorWhom
13473	13490	@DoctorWhom - Agreed.  Your list is helpful and I think it would be worthwhile to post it as a supplementary answer.  Although OP's description of the problem was yucky, the problem described is not unique to OP.	2017-09-05 12:55:52Z	aparente001

13440	14404	While I'm quite sympathetic with the OP and your answer's leaning: This is a very well constructed answer. Down to the wording. What I am currently lamenting is a certain lack of weighing the arguments. Some of your sources provide very weak evidence (small sample, weird experimental setup, differing quality of evidence); your last quote: "improved treatment of cancer"  vs "enhanced carcinogenisis". (But overall I hope to get criticised by you soon… ;)	2017-11-20 20:11:17Z	LangLangC
13440	14404	+1 and ditto on @LangLangC! EM Waves as such are obviously not a problem (the whole world’s full of them, but dosage makes the poison. What I‘m curious about: WiFi waves have lower energy levels than the visible spectrum. Shouldn’t it be more safe sleeping near a router than next to a lamp, if the amount of radiation received is comparable? // I wouldn’t worry about it too much, unless a rooter is in one‘s sleeping room close to one’s bed.	2017-11-20 21:17:25Z	Narusan-in-coma
13440	14404	@LangLangC Thank you for your kind words and constructive feedback.

13440	14404	I want to upvote this due to the overall quality, but I have the same problem LangLangC and Narusan expressed. The evidence of harm from low-level EMF sources such as wifi, cell phones, bluetooth, etc. is far from convincing. Keep in mind that all of us have been bombarded with much higher energy EMF 24/7 since the day we were conceived. Radio, television, radar, and extra-terrestrial sources all significantly exceed the power levels emitted by wireless devices (wifi router ~6 watts, TV station ~50,000 watts), so why would these low-power source be harmful while high-power sources are not?	2017-11-21 01:19:57Z	Carey Gregory
13435	13437	Great answer.  You might add that making a decision on whether to recommend screening tests for the entire population is different from deciding whether to screen an individual patient.  At the population level, cost-benefit and risk (like number needed to harm) are extremely important.    At the individual level, individual considerations must be taken into consideration. That is why it takes a clinician to discern whether or not to do a non-recommended screening test (or not do a recommended screening test).	2017-08-26 06:43:27Z	DoctorWhom
13429	13432	So. There is no hope for finding an effective cancer cure from now till years and years. It appears from your  response, that the immunotherapy will be like other cancer treatments (it may work for some, and don't for others, like chemotherapy). And we are talking about the survival rate which is the same so.	2017-08-25 04:58:07Z	
13429	13432	The survival rate is not the same. For the ones it works for, it is amazing. But yes, research is slow and things that have been killing us for centuries can't just go away in a matter of months or even years just because we wish they would. Progress is being made. Remember though, that even things we can cure still kill people today.	2017-08-25 05:24:50Z	Kate Gregory

13423	13424	Good answer but one correction: antacids like calcium carbonate (Tums) neutralize acid; PPI and H2 blockers reduce secretion of the acid in the first place.  PPIs are stronger than H2 blockers.	2017-08-24 05:21:32Z	DoctorWhom
13423	13424	Edited answer slightly to clarify that; please revert if you disagree.	2017-08-24 09:21:17Z	DoctorWhom
13423	13424	Thanks for the correction, and to add to that, meds such as Carafate are similar to normal calcium carbonates such as tums in turn have aluminum oxide to further aid in coating the ulcer and alkalizing the acid.	2017-08-24 13:58:22Z	cloudnyn3
13420	13446	It does help, thank you.	2017-08-26 15:17:50Z	
13418	13447	This has all the elements of a good answer, but it lacks supporting sources and we require them here. Basically, if you make an assertion of fact, you need to tell us "says who."	2017-08-28 03:51:18Z	Carey Gregory
13407	13414	Welcome to HealthSE! Thanks for your desire to help.  But SE works differently from other Q&A sites, it requires evidence-based answers.  You provide not only no resources backing up the "never soap" claim, but the claim itself is dubious.  There's evidence for not using antibacterial soap regularly, but I am not aware of evidence for not using any soap or body wash at all.  At least none that stacks up, to my knowledge. Please share your sources.	2017-08-23 07:18:24Z	DoctorWhom
13407	13414	-1: Adding to what @DoctorWhom pointed out: White dots on the penis are very probable on the outside skin, so there is no need in this occasion to wash the spots under the foreskin. Any dermatological soap is fine to clean skin.	2017-08-23 15:31:05Z	Narusan-in-coma
13407	13414	I am aware of dermatologist and gynecologist advice not to use soap between the labia minora as it is a self-cleaning mucous membrane and soap can cause irritation that mimicks bladder infection. But yes soap (or body wash like Dove per derm) everywhere else.  And the glans penis, which is not a mucous membrane, should be gently cleaned.  I don't have a source on me so I didn't answer it formally, but it's medical advice out there.	2017-08-23 16:46:06Z	DoctorWhom

13376	13387	I think it would be worth pointing out that this doesn't mean the OP needs to avoid citrus, just the same way people on warfarin don't need to avoid leafy greens. They simply need to be consistent with their diet. In other words, have two limes a day if you wish, but don't suddenly have 10.	2017-08-20 14:39:54Z	Carey Gregory
13376	13387	@CareyGregory - Whilst it is possible that citrus foods can be eaten, it is advisable to consult your doctor before doing so to ensure that the correct information is given for the OPs situation	2017-08-20 15:02:36Z	Chris
13376	13387	That's rock solid advice but frankly not very practical in US medicine in 2017. Been on coumadin and a couple of DOACs more than once for a long time now, so I'm familiar with the practices. You're not going to be talking to doctors about limes, and if you do, they're going to look puzzled that you asked and say sure, in moderation. The person you'll actually be speaking with is a nurse practitioner, and they're going to give you the same advice. Eat what you want, but do it in moderation and keep it consistent. No binges. I wouldn't hesitate to eat a couple of limes per day on coumadin.	2017-08-21 04:54:14Z	Carey Gregory

13347	13351	Very useful info, thanks very much. Is there some reason you did not upvote my question?	2017-08-16 19:27:39Z	
13347	13351	@TylerDurden, if you accept my answer, your rep gets increased, so I didn't see the point. However, if it makes you feel better...	2017-08-17 19:23:44Z	BillDOe
13342	13346	Doctors ARE actually scientists, with additional training as clinicians. At least in most countries.  In the US, most have science degrees prior to med school, and even most of them have a publication or five. But science in 15 minutes is, accurately, limited in how deep it is POSSIBLE to investigate.  The rest of your answer is solid.  For problems that don't have a clear answer but are distressing to you, a longitudinal relationship with a primary care doctor (or specialist if needed) is a good idea to work together until there's (1) an answer or (2) symptoms are adequately controlled.	2017-08-16 16:22:43Z	DoctorWhom
13342	13346	I'll upvote if you adjust that first sentence.  Unless you explain your reasoning, like if you're a physician or a doctorate level scientist with knowledge of the training involved?  Maybe you mean career research scientists?  Research is mandatory in training...  Also doctors are  more than algorithm crunchers -  "easily fit" is not accurate and almost sarcastic.  It IS true that if something doesn't fit a clinical picture clearly, it is very difficult to define.  But there is much that hasn't been researched adequately yet, and a lag from research to publication (true in all sciences)	2017-08-16 16:44:21Z	DoctorWhom
13342	13346	You're right to a degree that if you had a researcher on your case alone, some things could be eventually figured out.  But many will not.  My mother has 2 conditions that no physician has ever been able to identify. I used to not be able to understand why not.  Now I realize that there isn't enough known yet to be able to identify the phys/pathophys underlying a lot of symptoms and syndromes.	2017-08-16 16:51:07Z	DoctorWhom
13341	13343	Thanks Smeato!  Some good info in there.  But I'm interested in your sources for "you've adjusted your diet already, which likely won't make you lose too much weight" as per my understanding, calorie restriction alone is actually more effective in weight loss than exercise is alone.  Of course exercise is important for health and toning and does contribute to weight loss.  But since you put it in an answer, there's a requirement for sources to back up information, and that is a hot topic for discussion.	2017-08-16 11:04:25Z	DoctorWhom
13341	13343	@DoctorWhom I have no sources other than my own experience. As such I've updated my question to show this is my personal opinion. Hope this is sufficient!	2017-08-16 11:07:30Z	Smeato
13341	13343	@Narusan no worries! Happy to learn too	2017-08-16 13:48:35Z	Smeato
13341	13343	I'll +1 but you should remove "fatty" from the first sentence as that's not actually accurate either, it's reducing caloric intake.  Fatty foods are often high calorie, and many fats are unhealthy for other reasons, but within calorie budget, 100 calories of mayonnaise and 100 calories of pasta are not known to be different for losing weight.  At least the evidence hasn't shown it to be so, unless you've found something different.	2017-08-16 15:16:34Z	DoctorWhom
13341	13345	So this is a good way to answer a question, except for a couple things.  (1) you need resources. That's a nutrition website for activities, which is okay, I mean for the calculator and other assertions.  (2) Calculators sometimes (or even often) overestimate, studies have shown this.  The average for some populations BMR is closer to 1500.  Example this estimates my BMR at 1923; formally measured, mine measured was 1190.  If I ate my calculated BMR, that 730 difference is a pound gained every 5 days.  Let alone +500 for activity.  I would recommend adding a discussion that it varies widely.	2017-08-17 04:49:17Z	DoctorWhom
13327	13340	You may be right DoctorWhom . But I am looking for alternatives. I stopped smoking, PDE5 not working for me. Low testosterone. Maybe a PIED, I am on my rebooting period. Low libido. These are my problems.	2017-08-16 13:32:39Z	
13327	13340	You probably won't find an answer on homeopathy on this site, and we can't advise your individual situation.  Get a primary care provider who you can unite the big picture with -  the recommendations of different doctors.  Specialists (urology) with endocrinology with psychiatry (if you're the guy who asked a similar question and is on the med that increases prolactin?) and get you connected with psychOLOGY/counseling.  Just because testosterone is low doesn't mean that is the only reason for ED.	2017-08-16 15:21:52Z	DoctorWhom

13308	13314	@fbleb Exactly. However, smokers have higher risks of cancer etc. because the total amount of smoke and chemicals they are exposed to is higher (they inhale smoke more often than bystanders)	2017-08-14 14:58:24Z	Narusan-in-coma

13299	13468	@Narusan Drugbank was down at the time of writing. I've taken notes on caffeine before, and knew it to contain the info I was looking for, so I'll pulled up an archive.	2017-08-30 22:15:50Z	
13292	13293	Also consider adding Cognitive behavioral therapy - it has in studies been as effective as medications for some anxieties.  Google for more info.  I've seen it work amazingly well for a number of people.	2017-08-15 07:41:38Z	DoctorWhom

13292	13336	All that to say, I do not really have anxiety at present.  I do sometimes have brief moments where I can feel it wanting to come back on, but the combination of changes I have made as well as getting my thyroid sorted have meant I live mostly anxiety free, at least to the degree the average person does.  I used to have times it felt almost paralyzing.  It's an awful feeling.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone.	2017-08-16 03:48:17Z	threetimes
13271	13274	+1 Thanks for fixing my mistakes :D. It is very uncommon here in Germany to do blood tests when one is suffering from a cold (if at all X-ray for pneumonia) so I just drew my conclusion from the nytimes article.	2017-08-11 07:16:06Z	Narusan-in-coma
13268	13270	To wax philosophical a moment, there are a TON of alternative medicine treatments that need more study. Those would be cheaper than studies on new substances.  There's no huge payoff from it so pharm industry isn't chasing those down.  But you could make a huge contribution to the health field if you were to find, for example, that X herb does in fact have strong evidence in treatment of Y disease.  Like everything it would require background lit review of naturopathic/other journals first, but it's a cheaper route than synthesizing something new.  But funding is the issue, as always.	2017-08-10 12:33:39Z	DoctorWhom
13268	13270	I like the idea of synthesizing. I would look at the most promising mechanisms that were found in nature and optimize them to have the desired effect. So the fundament would be compounds found in nature. I would start synthesizing compounds whose validity could be quickly checked like those glowing in the dark bacteria or synthesizing flavours. To avoid human rejection/allergic reactions I would imitate the natural compound, that does the job badly, as much as possible and then optimize using statistical models on a computer.	2017-08-10 13:50:05Z	
13268	13270	I saw ted.com/talks/… and theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/21/… - I presume when it comes to it, a computer and a desired compound is all you need nowadays to have it produced and shipped.	2017-08-10 13:54:43Z	
13268	13270	@DoctorWhom, this is a great answer. I'd like to add to the array of options presented here the concept of Citizen Science. The platform I'm most familiar with is Zooniverse and they even have a medicine section. Currently there isn't anything specific to drug design, but the antibiotics project (Bash the Bug) aims directly at improving the treatment for tuberculosis. Citizen science is a great way to contribute, open virtually to anyone.	2017-08-11 20:49:09Z	Don_S

13200	13206	+1. In healthcare shortage areas, ER/UC  do often end up becoming Primary Care.  If you present to the UC and give them your symptoms including depression and express your concern about causes of secondary depression and your inability to get tested anywhere else, they may do it there.  Btw @agradine, if depression is your only symptom then you're certainly correct checking for thyroid dysfunction, but testosterone is not usually first line in testing, and Vit D has lower evidence for strength of association with depression - so they may not do those.  Depends on the clinician.	2017-08-06 09:19:51Z	DoctorWhom

13029	13030	I really like your more nuanced description of naturopathy doctors, compared, for example, to Wikipedia's: "Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of pseudoscientific, alternative medicine ... based on vitalism and folk medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine." (Btw, I would not see a naturopathic doc myself, and I am a proud Wikipedian, so I'm not coming from a biased perspective in that regard.)	2017-07-20 06:04:33Z	Mark D Worthen PsyD
13029	13030	I was just providing a bit of background more than seeking medical advice. I was just curious about the use of these supplements together and over a period of time, the responses would have no impact on my decisions. I've never heard of Naturopathy to be honest, it also sounds like something I would keep away from usually. I'd also like to add that I do not feel I'm seriously ill and in need of urgent advice, I'm just interested. There are many reasons why my condition could have improved (it was not fatal); I'm fit and healthy and under 30. I have increased my fibre intake, quit drinking. etc	2017-07-20 13:23:37Z	
13029	13030	I will take a look at some of the medication interaction checkers, thanks. I'm not one of those people that believe in things like homeopathy. I think what I'm taking are just reasonable supplements of things that are naturally made within the body or are ingested to repair and maintain certain functions of it. Hopefully I'm not taking useless sugar pills.	2017-07-20 13:37:19Z	
13029	13030	That is a common mistake - once you provide a clinical story/background, it becomes medical advice.  Even though it seems that it is to help provide context and guide how someone might answer, that's basically the beginning of a clinical visit.	2017-07-20 14:53:01Z	DoctorWhom
13029	13030	There is a difference between homeopathy and naturopathy and functional medicine.  Read about them.  Treatments range in evidence of effectiveness from 0 to extremely strong.  I suggested those two types of medical providers because you are on several supplements and leaky gut syndrome is not fully a mainstream diagnosis (at least not yet), so seeing someone familiar with your diagnosis and what you take is better than coming into the average generalist with an MD or DO and limited awareness of those things.  I wish there WERE more research on supplements and alternative medicine treatments!	2017-07-20 14:58:49Z	DoctorWhom
13028	13049	This has the makings of a good answer but it lacks supporting sources, which we require here. Can you find a link for the Johns Hopkins article you cited? If so, that would be perfect.	2017-07-21 18:23:34Z	Carey Gregory

12984	13173	The study doesnt tell what the "placebo" "nonfluoride toothpaste" is,at least in it's abstract.They could have taken natural ingredients that are not doing anything and then claim fluoride is better. Looks like a deeply biased study.  That's like proving calcium fluoride has no important concerns to health effect if it stays insoluble, but then use Sodium Fluoride or Fluorosilicic in toothpaste or tap water.	2017-12-29 23:02:45Z	HerbalResearcher
12980	12994	1. About the "THIRDLY" point: So where is the arsenic, if not in the grain? Or rather, where do the studies which find arsenic actually find it? You would think they only check grains... 2. So it doesn't matter what kind of rice it is originally, just whether it's polished, parboilt or only-husk-removed? 3. Is parboilt rice "good enough" or is it still better to have the brown kind?	2017-07-17 16:03:35Z	
12980	12994	1.its in the layers beneath the husk not exactly inside the grain...2.i hve editd the answer on grain color...Polishing,parboiling etc are only milling processes not to be confused with the natural proprties of the grain i mean the genetics...3.brown is more nutritious than parboiled white but with the arsenic issue I think the latter is better(strictly from the refrnes)	2017-07-17 18:19:30Z	Catharanthus

12975	12976	so "to evaluate a " in the front of each of these pretty much explains them? As in "to evaluate a treatment" in this case?	2017-07-15 21:44:02Z	
12975	12976	@KateGregory I think so, yes.	2017-07-15 22:09:55Z	Carey Gregory

12971	12989	I mostly agree with your answer.  If I were in this situation, I would suggest that both partners get tested. That would be less offensive than asking only the new partner to get tested. And it would be fair for both to gain this information.	2017-08-04 08:53:39Z	Marzipanherz

12961	12963	This is a good answer but too heavy on abbreviations and shorthand. For example, it's not clear how to interpret this: Decreases in CO > Decrease BP. If you could clarify some of your shorthand that would be great.	2017-07-15 04:12:05Z	Carey Gregory
12961	12963	A decrease in cardiac output causes a decrease in blood pressure.	2017-07-18 12:00:32Z	
12961	12963	It is overly simplistic to directly correlate blood pressure and cardiac output as you have completely ignored the compliance of the vasculature. If vascular compliance had no effect on blood pressure then vasopressin and phenylephrine would be completely useless as vasopressors since they directly impact neither heart rate nor stroke volume (although both could indirectly decrease stroke volume by increasing afterload).	2018-01-28 07:58:53Z	RudyB

12916	12934	How quickly after the final dose of the vaccine do you have immunity? Presumably this depends on if it is the two or three dose schedule.	2017-07-13 19:04:01Z	StrongBad
12916	12934	@StrongBad The immunity it confers is a curve beginning with the first shot that rises until some weeks after the last one, so there isn't a day when you're not immune and the next day you are. And keep in mind that not everyone develops immunity from the vaccine. Some people simply never do even after two series of shots.	2017-07-13 23:55:25Z	Carey Gregory
12916	12934	I think your answer is incomplete then since it is much more complicated then simply completing the series, but has to do with how far into the immunity development process you are. The initial studies may have looked at immunity levels as a function of time in order to get the correct dosages and time intervals.	2017-07-14 00:11:34Z	StrongBad
12916	12934	@StrongBad However the studies were done doesn't matter. Immunity is never a yes/no question for any disease. It's always a fluctuating curve that varies over time, circumstances, and health of the individual. It's entirely possible for someone who showed a strong, positive titer to HBV to die of it due to being immunocompromised by drugs, disease, AIDS, etc.	2017-07-14 01:50:25Z	Carey Gregory
12911	12959	+1 for the statement "Sticking with one doctor and going from them to a specialist and then back again is probably the best way to build trust."  This is one recommended management of health anxiety or "illness anxiety disorder."  Acid reflux and allergies and asthma are very  common causes of chronic cough.  Stick with a doctor and follow treatment recommendations closely.  Partner together and follow up until you either feel you understand it, it resolves, or the symptoms are adequately managed.	2017-07-15 04:46:28Z	DoctorWhom
12911	12959	Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is also a treatment for health anxiety, like other types of anxiety.	2017-07-15 04:47:18Z	DoctorWhom
12911	12959	Thank you all. I would like to hear more about your coughing day and night tho	2017-07-16 13:02:35Z	
12911	12959	the specifics of my cough are unlikely to be useful. I was sick. It made me cough. It got really bad. I had many many symptoms in addition to the cough. Then it got better. All my symptoms are gone.	2017-07-16 13:26:00Z	Kate Gregory
12911	12959	I changed the family doctor and went to Gastrointestinal and stomach doctor. He said the same. I went to ear, nose and throat doctor and said the same and had allergy and the cough will take too long to go off. I went to lung doctor and said the same. I eat well. I did lots of echos and scanners to stomack and lung and throat with full blood tests and nothing was found. Just cough from allergy ? It made me really annoyed.	2017-07-16 16:20:20Z	
12908	12915	EMS uses AVPU only casually and generally only on initial assessment. They almost always use GCS subsequent to that.	2017-07-11 14:34:01Z	Carey Gregory
12908	12915	@CareyGregory Edited the answer. Thanks for pointing that out!	2017-07-12 08:30:14Z	Narusan-in-coma
12908	12915	I used to moderate an EMS forum with worldwide membership so I'm fairly familiar with practices worldwide and GCS is pretty much a standard everywhere, not just US/Canada. AVPU simply isn't adequate in the prehospital setting. You can't triage a patient to a trauma center based on AVPU. Honestly, I would just strike the whole AVPU thing with regard to EMS.	2017-07-13 02:14:34Z	Carey Gregory

12888	14590	This has the makings of a good answer but it's lacking supporting references. Site policy requires them. They don't have to be exhaustive. A single credible source that supports your main assertions of fact will suffice.	2017-12-07 01:32:24Z	Carey Gregory

12868	12869	This information is based on articles I've read over the years about genetics, evolution, and disease, so I don't know if I can find citations for anything in particular. However, if I can find something, I will update my answer. (And yes, I did search for some corroborating material before I posted this. Unfortunately, even articles from reputable sources make inaccurate claims about evolution and genetics, possibly because they're aimed at the general population and, therefore, make shortcuts in logic.)	2017-07-07 22:19:36Z	BillDOe

12836	12838	I really appreciate your answer... I imagine that good, ordinary people described in the experiment i posted and i think: how is it possible? Why do you think my question is ridiculous?

12836	12838	If you read that experiment, you cannot think - at least - "that's strange"... why that normal people turn so quickly in bad people doing horrible thing with no excuses linked to their survival	2017-07-04 22:21:03Z	
12836	12838	I don't think your question is ridiculous. I was simply trying to point out that "evil" is not an actual physiological state, parameter etc. So even if you change the question to "mechanisms" there is still no answer. On the other hand, aggression and obedience are some of the keywords you are looking for and those are terms you should do research on. What you're asking is too broad and doesn't have an actual answer. I believe though, in my answer, I provided you with all the right tools for you to proceed.	2017-07-04 22:34:14Z	Antony

12811	12812	So it seems like the best treatment for insomnia-related immunodeficiency would be a medication that mimics the REM signal to the immune system. By any chance does this also mean that some forms of brain damage or deficiency could impair immunity through a similar mechanism (with no damage to the immune system otherwise)?	2017-07-03 16:29:54Z	
12811	12812	@ user1258361 subject to confirmation and understanding of the pathways by neuroscientists.Like I said the pathways of REM interaction with immunity are not very well understood.	2017-07-03 17:28:42Z	Catharanthus

12810	12830	This answer has no citations at all to prove this claim, which is very nonspecific. Why would a run not be advisable? Would the OP fail to lose weight? Be injured or damaged in some way? Find running more difficult than it otherwise would be? This is not really an answer at this point, it needs details and references to be one.	2017-07-04 12:32:46Z	Kate Gregory
12810	12830	@USer345738380 I don't advise cutting sleeping hours either.  Ensuring adequate sleep is a component of weight management (sleep quality/quantity is part of our hospital system's weight mgmt clinic intake form, and we routinely send people for sleep studies based on STOPBANG scores...)  Perhaps go to bed earlier to accommodate morning runs.	2017-07-05 07:59:07Z	DoctorWhom

12802	12826	These are interesting articles. Do you know of any articles which directly compare sugar intake from solid foods vs. liquid sugar intake? I believe the rapid rise in blood sugar rather than the total sugar content is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, but I have not proof for this.	2017-07-04 20:24:38Z	
12802	12826	A mechanism of biological plausibility would be that with a rapid rise in blood sugar the body releases too much insulin because the blood sugar is too high. When blood sugar rises more slowly the amount of insulin released fits the amount of glucose more adequately. Therefore liquid sugar intake could cause insulin resistance, but I'm only speculating.	2017-07-04 20:29:15Z	
12802	12826	That--rapid spikes in glucose increases risk of Type 2 Diabetes--is certainly a tenable hypothesis. You might want to look at the research on glycemic load for some insights.	2017-07-04 22:01:45Z	Mark D Worthen PsyD

12769	12770	I thoroughly disagree. I've had propofol over a dozen times, and it does produce a very pleasant high, but it lasts only a few seconds before you become unconscious. That unconsciousness is not sleep. It's more like simply having your brain switched off. There are no dreams, no awareness, no twilight state. You're just utterly unaware.	2017-06-27 22:10:34Z	Carey Gregory

12749	12751	I believe the question is about the popular assertion that you might as well not drink a diuretic liquid, because it causes your body to excrete more liquid than you just took in, leaving you as dehydrated as before if not more so. Anecdotally I think it's nonsense; I knew many adults who only drank tea, coffee, and beer, and were alive. Yet it is a common claim - not about diuretic meds, but about drinks that have a diuretic effect.	2017-06-26 11:52:28Z	Kate Gregory

12732	12774	@hartacus, the pleasure was mine. I actually learned something myself, as I was under the opposite impression (i.e. that lactase only split one lactose molecule), because of assumptions I made concerning the instructions regarding the lactase product I mentioned. I now realize that the recommended amount of lactase is based on it catalyzing the lactose in whole milk in 12 hours and not on it being used up.	2017-06-30 19:05:30Z	BillDOe

I know yoga helps people, myself I've only done breathing exercises like breath slowly through your nose and inhale, keep it there for 5-7 seconds and then breath out naturally via mouth. If you do that minimum of 10-20 times, that will absolutely help you and stay focused.  I listen to music everywhere I go, not trying to think about work and listen to stuff that makes me happy and getting to another dimension (I love 80's music, sound design and soundtrack). Try Ulrich Schnauss albums, Yann Tiersen, Electric Youth, Ben Lukas Boysen ...what more, yeah. Ur body needs a pause.	2017-08-03 08:00:07Z	DeeKey
12725	13209	also, try to relax, I also can find myself in my bed or couch, laying down and trying to "pause" and relax with my body, every body part from top to toe and just relax 100%, every muscle and every part of me. That helps. Listen to calm music, maybe some Bach piano sonatas or partitas? :) Cello suites are also good.  I'd say breathing exercises for 15 mins, easy yoga movements and also some relaxing and laying down, good relaxing music. :)  Watch some series on HBO or Netflix, documentaries and just change world :)	2017-08-03 08:02:44Z	DeeKey

12721	13836	The words "platform switching" do not ring much of sense to me. What is your opinion on mechanical strength (lack of thereof) of this system? Do you think it is good to use in molar areas?	2017-10-02 03:38:14Z	
12721	13836	@Ben Lim Welcome to Health.SE!  We require statements to be backed up by evidence found in reliable sources.

12721	13836	I have used implants as short as 5.5-6 mm long in the molar areas but that is after I have no better choice like bone grafting options. The few cases I have done have 100% success after 5 years (please note that this is only in my personal situation)	2017-10-18 06:25:00Z	Ben Lim
12721	13836	And platform switch designs are not limited to the Ankylos brand.	2018-02-18 02:27:08Z	enap_mwf
12714	12718	Might be worth mentioning the pharyngeal arches to understand where the person is coming from with the amphibious question, and that they can't survive outside the mother, not just in water in general (modern incubation being a separate caveat)	2017-06-21 18:51:28Z	Atl LED
12714	12718	@AtlLED  I couldn't really find any source that the pharyngeal arches aren't used for oxygen intake, but this article is pretty detailed about them. Feel free to post your own answer and focus on the pharyngeal arches.	2017-06-21 19:03:39Z	Narusan-in-coma
12714	12718	No, I meant they are the reason people have ideas that fetuses are amphibious are pharyngeal arches, and a quick note about why that logic doesn't hold up.	2017-06-21 19:10:02Z	Atl LED
12714	12718	@AtlLED What about the current version? I haven't found good explanations why the pharyngeal arches aren't a way of oxygen intake but will keep on searching.	2017-06-21 19:34:44Z	Narusan-in-coma
12714	12718	Just out of curiosity, would it be possible to provide a human with oxygen through the blood directly, in case for example of asphyxia ?	2017-06-22 14:11:53Z	
12709	12710	Actually most doctors would not order the testosterone/estrogen/DHEA or stress hormones to start out with unless clinical history suggests something like PCOS. Usually they start with CMP CBC A1c Lipids TSH (and maybe T4/T3).  Additional testing depends on the history and physical exam, and then results of the first round of tests.	2018-02-15 22:46:44Z	DoctorWhom
12704	12705	If you somehow find these sources online (arXiv, or usually the abstract is available and the rest of the article is behind a pay wall) it would be great if you could link them in your references!	2017-06-21 05:03:08Z	Narusan-in-coma
12702	12703	+1 Nice research! Great to point out inconsistencies within the study.	2017-06-20 20:52:30Z	Narusan-in-coma
12702	12703	Thank you! And sorry for the outburst. Must be the soft drinks I had earlier ;)	2017-06-20 20:56:48Z	Antony
12761	12762	I've heard that rabies is more common with stray dogs and that stray cats rarely get rabies. Surffed the net too to see it. But i can't disagree on the rest of what you said. Thanks for your comment.	2017-06-22 03:01:43Z	
12761	12762	The CDC keeps track of these things; see cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/domestic.html.  Every year that I found they reported the numbers for the US, more cats than dogs were reported to have rabies.  In developing countries, dogs are more of a risk.	2017-06-22 03:19:36Z	
12761	12762	Ok, can't say no to that! Thanks for proving yourself.	2017-06-22 04:20:07Z	
12690	12700	While I agree with the gist of your answer, your references to CO2's dangers are very misleading and totally irrelevant to the question. The dangers of CO2 are from breathing it, not drinking it. The worst effect that drinking CO2-infused beverages will create is belching. -1 for that. Remove the toxicity references and I'll remove my downvote.	2017-10-17 01:43:54Z	Carey Gregory
12681	12682	Ok thank you very much for the advice.	2017-06-18 20:09:16Z	
12681	12682	@Downvoter: If you leave a comment explaining why you downvoted, your feedback is a lot more helpful for me and the Community.	2017-06-21 20:49:56Z	Narusan-in-coma
12680	12699	In conclusion, your body certainly kind of adapts to situations like "being hit blunt objects" by losing the sense of touch, but you don't "get better at it", you just feel the damage a little bit less because you've already destroyed a lot of sensory nerves. - Isn't it interesting how damage makes a system adapt to outer circumstances? Who would have thought that.	2017-06-20 21:01:16Z	Narusan-in-coma
12680	12699	Indeed, it is rather intriguing. But I'm not sure if it should be called "adaptation" since it's just an injury outcome. Adaptation usually suggest an advantage. One might argue that compromising your sense of touch is quite a disadvantage since you cannot feel and protect that body part from further harm.	2017-06-20 21:13:01Z	Antony

12676	13394	And evidence for its effectiveness?	2017-08-22 07:24:44Z	DoctorWhom
12676	13394	Your answer would be a lot better if it didn't contain advertisement of products and a bit more sources for the claims.	2017-09-19 18:30:22Z	Narusan-in-coma
12676	13394	@Narusan-in-coma - I don't see any advertisement of a product. He is describing a fringe treatment, that is offered by many dermatologists. His only self reference is "Many of my patients are happy", but there is no link. I do find it interesting that at least 3 people agree with the lack of references and lack of evidence for the efficacy, yet nobody downvoted the answer.	2017-09-19 19:41:08Z	JohnP
12676	13394	@DoctorWhom ^^^	2017-09-19 19:41:31Z	JohnP
12672	12679	Thanks Isaacson for your answer, it makes lots of sense!	2017-06-18 13:20:37Z	
12672	12679	@HelloWorld Or at least the answer you wanted to hear.	2017-06-19 13:22:15Z	Carey Gregory
12672	12679	@CareyGregory you may be right ;-)	2017-06-19 14:00:40Z	
12672	12678	Thanks Carey for your answer. I tend to agree with your first case. Yet in the second case (baby hotter than adult) why would part of the baby's heat radiations be blocked (the adult chest is not made of tin foil) ? If Dad's chest acts as a heat exchanger then it will help the baby to cool won't it ?	2017-06-18 13:30:38Z	
12672	12678	@HelloWorld Dad's body is probably going to be much warmer than ambient air, but even if it's not, sweat can't evaporate from 40% of baby's body. Reducing the body's primary cooling mechanism by 40% can only result in less cooling. Whatever cooling he offers will be minimal and vastly less than free flowing air would be.	2017-06-18 13:49:12Z	Carey Gregory
12672	12678	You're right the cooling through free flowing air would be cut. So as Dad's body is mostly made of water and water is much more efficient to transfer heat than the air is, then baby's body would be at Dad's temperature (~37°C). Would it make sense to you ?	2017-06-18 13:57:17Z	
12672	12678	@HelloWorld No. First, the epidermis is the only part of their bodies touching and it is dead tissue with very little water content. Second, there's just no way you're cooling better pressed against a 37C body than with 25C circulating air evaporating sweat. Sweat evaporation is a far more efficient heat radiator than a human body pressed against you. If you doubt that, try it yourself. Go out, get all hot and sweaty, then find someone who will let you hug them. All that will do is make you both hotter than you were.	2017-06-18 17:47:23Z	Carey Gregory
12672	12678	1. Unless either baby or father have a defective physiology, neither will "get hotter than the other" they may feel subjectively hotter, but they will both actually be 37C (32-34C at skin) because that's the temperature our bodies maintain, so father's not going to be a heat source any more than the baby's own metabolism is (about 90 watts), his skin is going to be 34C, so is baby's.	2017-06-19 06:45:10Z	Isaacson

12653	12657	No, I was hoping for someone who has some basic understanding of the situation (unlike me) to point me into the right direction to what I am facing here. When I said I did not find anything similar on google, I was referring to the pictures. I found pictures of stomach cancer but none of them looked like the ones I posted here. The answer you provided gives me some reliable information at least. When I get home from work I will research what you gave me. So thank you.	2017-06-16 05:12:09Z	
12653	12657	@Divin3 Looking at medical imaging and deciding whether pictures are similar takes years of study and practice and if you are not a doctor I wouldn't try to do that. As a pharmacist I stare blankly at most of such images and have no idea what I'm looking at. As for the insight into your grandma's situation: we can't have any, since we never met her. Giving advice over the internet can do more harm than good. Under the first link Carey provided you have "General resources on coping" you might start there and read how to give moral support to your grandmother - every cancer patient needs it.	2017-06-16 06:33:35Z	Lucky

12611	12642	Is there any way to upload pictures to stackexchange?  I thought it would be nice to put up a picture of what we finally made.  It ended up being a combination of a cushion for the inside, an old plastic-rubber bath mat for the shoulders, a door snake for the head and neck and a theatre mask I got for 3.50 (Euros) at a toy shop.  The children liked it!	2017-10-08 14:20:17Z	
12611	12642	@Narusan-sedated Somewhat delayed, but done.  Thanks!	2017-12-14 14:18:32Z	
12605	12643	Overall decent answer. However, you need to add some references in order to keep this answer from being downvoted and deleted.	2017-06-14 16:58:24Z	L.B.

12575	12577	That's exciting. Hmm so I was basing my statement on looking through sr27 USDA database. I searched NUTR_DEF.txt for things like "fat", "lipid" and a couple of specific names of fatty acids. However, on closer inspection it looks like individual fatty acids have names like 4:0 and 22:0.	2017-06-09 20:53:39Z	
12574	12579	I am a male..so generally my test are good. No cancers, inflammations, heart diseases right ?	2017-06-09 20:47:10Z	
12574	12579	I am not going to diagnose you here. It does look good, nevertheless, it is vital to make another appointment to your doctor. Even if you have to pay money for that, your health and life should be worth it. The pain and coughing may be symptoms of lethal diseases only a doctor will recognize.	2017-06-09 20:51:25Z	Narusan-in-coma
12574	12579	Yeah I did. So just make me relax. On paper my test is good ?	2017-06-09 20:53:27Z	
12574	12579	On paper, your doctor can rule out inflammation. (Cancer and heart disease are very very unlikely and the tests were probably only done to rule out inflammation). This means that instead of a viral infect, a bacterial infect could lead to your symptoms. The doctor will try to find out if it is in fact a bacterial infect and which bacterial infect it is.	2017-06-09 20:55:38Z	Narusan-in-coma
12574	12579	Thanks Narusan. Bacterial infect I think is dangerous too. Thank you Narusan you make me relaxed and understand why my doctor asks for those tests. And thanks god thatvthe result are good enough to eliminate some dangerous disease.	2017-06-09 21:02:14Z	
12565	12569	I would recommend you to find references for your claim that it is completely normal to be skinny when young, which would greatly improve your answer. Currently, I fail to see how this is any different than a copied answer.	2017-06-08 21:24:56Z	Narusan-in-coma
12565	12569	Well, I did bring in the additional info that adding body fat % to BMI is a better heuristic for evaluating healthy weight. I'll edit to hopefully make my answer better. I'm new.	2017-06-08 21:36:02Z	WakeDemons3
12565	12567	Just to add to this excellent answer, that friend's BMI is 11.17% of the range from minimum to max for normal.	2017-06-09 00:27:13Z	BillDOe
12549	12552	We are talking about falls outside. I don't quite see how bringing a cushion with you everything you go outside would be handy.	2017-06-07 09:21:29Z	Narusan-in-coma
12549	12552	Depending on where it is outside, for example the mangar comes in a carry case that can fit in your car, the battery pack will inflate the cushion 2-3 times easily and will charge from a 12v adapter. As I said in the answer you would need someone else with you to retrieve it, but it's a "no lift" solution for someone who falls	2017-06-07 09:49:28Z	Edd Davis
12549	12552	Sorry, but I have to agree with @Narusan that it's just not practical. What's he supposed to do if he's home alone and wants to go out to get the mail? If he needs someone with him to operate a bulky £1,440 device, then he'd be better off simply having that someone walk with him and make sure he doesn't fall.	2017-06-08 00:45:53Z	Carey Gregory
12538	13332	Note that consumption of beans/legumes etc when they are new or infrequent to your diet can cause bloating, but that usually resolves after a few weeks with frequent consumption.	2017-09-06 07:46:51Z	DoctorWhom

12503	12514	+1 those types usually have pipelines for veins that you can hit from 50 feet away. You had me bursting into laughter there. Good answer! Without too much nitpicking, if you could include in your answer why hanging an arm off the edge will engorge a vein, your answer wouldn't even need references because you provided the explanation yourself.	2017-06-05 08:01:15Z	Narusan-in-coma
12500	12506	while this is interesting "how to have less insomnia" material, that wasn't the question. The question was "should I get up and do stuff when I wake up?" and there is nothing in this answer aimed at that. It's a great answer to an entirely different question asking about diet and exercise and their effect on insomnia.	2017-06-04 00:14:28Z	Kate Gregory
12500	12506	@KateGregory I've made some changes in the text to make clear that a long term goals aimed at sleeping better could be used to decide what to do when an incident where you don't get enough sleep happens. That's a personal matter, so I can't say you have to do this or that. A morning person who doesn't get enough sleep may want to exercise in the morning while an evening person like me will prefer to do it later in the day. Thing is that with lifestyle change involving exercise this is  something you need to think about while previously you could just coast along with a few hours sleep.	2017-06-04 01:03:17Z	Count Iblis
12496	12497	Then the problem is the "empty calories", not the sugar itself. If those same juices were full of complex carbs instead of simple sugars, you would still have the same problem of "empty calories". Then why do we keep focusing on the sugar?	2017-06-02 19:13:19Z	
12496	12498	Is youtube really the only place you can find support for that? Most people, me included, hate having to watch a video just to get info we could read in 30 seconds.	2017-06-02 05:52:15Z	Carey Gregory
12496	12498	@CareyGregory I'll add in the refs from the video later today.	2017-06-02 20:33:18Z	Count Iblis

12510	15362	Hi there @bengy we encourage citations for the information provided. Your suggestions seem reasonable, but how would we know for sure? For example, what if someone mentioned something like, "Eat 10 servings of ice cream every day too!" Please back up your statements with supporting evidence from reliable sources. Thanks! :)	2018-02-18 03:58:24Z	Dave Liu
12510	15362	Ha. Sorry for that. I wasn't aware of the fact that you must provide soruces.  Also, I am not sure I can find exact soruces for it. He asked for a specific suggestion so I build it individually for him.  I guess it's some variation of something else.	2018-02-18 09:32:24Z	bengy
12510	15362	Our site doesn't handle personal diagnosis, since that could get very, very grey (and cause legal problems). As such, we try to address questions in a general manner, even if the poster has a specific case (helps more people anways). Also, we strongly encourage sources for everything, even "common sense" stuff. For example, a quick google of "nih regular exercise" yields this: go4life.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/… which is a concise reference source (convenient for you to cite), considered credible, and very easy to understand. Good luck!	2018-02-18 20:15:54Z	Dave Liu
12510	15362	OK.  I appreciate your polite way of correcting me. Despite being on this site for a while I almost haven't used it up until recently.  So thx for the information.	2018-02-19 16:58:06Z	bengy
12471	12695	Excellent answer	2017-06-20 11:53:37Z	Narusan-in-coma
12471	12695	"but laughter can prevent Type 2 Diabetes" seems waaaaaay to strong, especially with the design of the study between cortisol and abdominal fat.  I can certainly believe that laughing reduces a stress hormone like cortisol, which more importantly helps regulate blood sugar levels directly (no need to stop at fat in the diabetes conversation).	2017-06-21 18:17:24Z	Atl LED
12470	12472	Welcome to Health! Please remove the tumor bit, there's no need to worry the OP with claims without references. This actually brings me to the second point: A good answer on Health.SE is expected to have references to support it.	2017-05-31 13:15:34Z	Narusan-in-coma
12461	12462	Welcome to Health.SE.

12461	12462	Thanks for pointing out the error. Going with the "vitamin supplements are only prescribed for deficient persons" theory doesn't explain the high availability of off-shelf multi-vitamin tablets (a shotgun approach, rather than filling in for a specific deficiency). Also, I'm aware of the fact that absorption is lower than what you ingest. But presumably that applies equally to RDA? If we consider 1000mg = 500mg absorbed, then an RDA of 90mg = approx 70mg absorbed.	2017-05-31 08:03:22Z	
12461	12462	Also note that my question about why these supplements contain above the needed amount. Your answer focuses mainly on who should take them, but not on why the dose should be so high for those people. In fact you've even said a supplement should be around 125mg, so we're still missing an explanation as to why they're typically more like 1000 - 2000mg.	2017-05-31 08:06:09Z	
12461	12462	RDA 90mg means you should at least have consumed 125mg(approx) to get that much. If you see labels of food items that show the vitamin contents(example: certain cereals boxes) you'll see that the value is written as a percentage as it represents the approximate percentage of the RDA you're body is most likely going to get(this also differs from person to person)	2017-05-31 09:34:55Z	Chikku
12461	12462	Also I think I was not clear on point (c). I merely meant to say that if you want 90mg of Vitamin C to be absorbed you will need to consume approx 125mg. Normal people do this everyday and therefore there is no need for such a supplement. Also for any vitamin deficiency to show it takes a really long time. Its not like starvation that shows in few days after you stop eating . It takes years before signs and symptoms of vitamin deficiency start to show and it also takes months to restore these lost vitamins. Hence a high dose of 1000mg is recommended.	2017-05-31 09:40:14Z	Chikku
12453	12463	Spelling out acronyms on first use makes for a better answer.	2017-05-30 22:31:54Z	Carey Gregory
12453	12463	@Carey Indeed, spelling out the acronyms correctly goes one step further. For reference, TNR stands for trap-neuter-return. For balance, the ASPCA among other organizations endorses TNR (see aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/…). You have provided no evidence here that the number of rabies cases in cats have risen due to TNR programs; rather, eradication of the disease in other species has been more effective. Dogs remain the major vector species for rabies in much of the developing world.	2017-05-31 04:54:50Z	Harry Vervet
12453	12463	The only "animal welfare" groups and veterinarians that recommend and support any incarnation of this inhumane TNR practice are those that make a quick buck off of exploiting suffering animals in the media to manipulate fools into padding their king-sized ransom bank-accounts. HSUS was fined nearly $16M for engaging in this creation and exploitation of suffering animals to manipulate the public into donating to them, guilty under the RICO anti-racketeering act. ASPCA is next. You can't exploit suffering cats for millions of dollars if you humanely euthanize them first, their only value today	2017-05-31 19:50:56Z	JustPassingThrough
12453	12463	You've kind of gone off the rails a bit with your answer. It was a good answer but your edits took it off topic. The question has nothing to do with TNR, animal welfare, or other zoonotic diseases. I would also quibble with equating MRSA with necrotizing fasciitis ("flesh-eating disease"). Although staph is often the culprit, it's not necessary for them to be drug-resistant to cause necrotizing fasciitis, and half a dozen bacteria other than staph can also cause it, so the two things really aren't one and the same.	2017-06-01 01:35:34Z	Carey Gregory

12368	12371	@CareyGregory I'll take a look at studies on these population. I have read some time ago that in some of these population they do get arterial plaque but that their arteries are wider due to the exercise they get. There may also be genetic factors, in case of some Indian tribes that are free of heart disease it is known that they actually get heart disease at quite young ages when they leave the jungle.Do I have the right genetics and physiology to allow me to eat lots of meat and not bother eating fruits and vegetables? I'm not prepared to put myself to the test :).	2017-05-28 22:50:23Z	Count Iblis

12297	12644	Adding to your excellent answer: AFAIK, hands wrinkle due to osmosis. I suspect the amniotic fluid has a higher density of minerals etc. than the skin cells of a baby's hand, so it won't wrinkle.	2017-06-16 20:16:37Z	Narusan-in-coma
12272	12277	I'd be inclined to agree with this - Higher reporting proportions will lead to higher overall numbers; A higher number of overall prescription fillings would also make sense. What I'd be worried about would be if the rate of filling errors went up 465%.	2017-05-13 01:06:55Z	schizoid04
12272	12277	Good catch! I agree it's unsurprising such a growth be artificial. Follow-up question: To what extent does filling more prescriptions increase the number of medication errors?	2017-05-13 01:55:31Z	
12269	12537	Here's the thing: I have relatives that regularly go to India, so I have obtained a Freestyle Libre Pro with both parts, i.e. both what the patient would use and what the doctor would use.  So I'm effectively using the Freestyle Libre Pro as a Freestyle Libre.  This is working well for me, and I intend to use it indefinitely unless I find another solution that doesn't require fingerstick calibration.	2017-06-06 12:37:11Z	
12269	12537	Nice! I am curious. Why is fingerstick calibration such an obstacle for you? The issue with any CGM is that, for management purposes, it is 12-15 minutes behind, since it operates on interstitial liquid -- so manual fingersticks are often really useful in any case. Are you using the FLP just for data analysis post facto, or for management purposes?	2017-06-06 16:11:28Z	WestOfPecos
12269	12537	Because I just hate getting shots.  So I prefer the Freestyle Libre Pro, which only requires an injection once every two weeks, to doing daily fingerpricks.  And yeah, I don't use blood sugar testing to do real-time management of my blood sugar levels.  I just check the Freestyle Libre Pro once every 24 hours or so to see a graph of what my blood sugar has been like.	2017-06-06 16:24:45Z	
12269	12537	I get it. You don't need insulin, then. I had misunderstood your original use case.	2017-06-06 16:36:36Z	WestOfPecos
12269	12537	I do take insulin.  I take Triceba once a day.  I have type 2 diabetes.  I don't need to take short-acting insulin to combat real-time surges in blood sugar, so I don't need up to the minute blood sugar readings.	2017-06-06 16:48:17Z	
12267	14375	Welcome to HealthSE! If you could expand your bit on competing factors and cite the claim for the non-reglation this will be a nice answer and important addition.	2017-11-16 18:18:46Z	LangLangC
12267	14375	The FDA not regulating nutritional supplements is a simple fact in the USA, so in my opinion no citation for that is needed.	2017-11-17 18:19:34Z	DoctorWhom
12267	14375	@DoctorWhom While I agree with you: Is that fact generally known, are people aware of it there (US) or here on HealthSE? Jurisdictions differ, experiences differ, readers differ. I think the answer improves by it now! at-cogito: If you also quote the (~two?) most crucial sentences from your sources I'm happy to +1 this.	2017-11-17 18:46:38Z	LangLangC
12262	12264	That last suggestion seems super! And your answer does point out my question does need a minor extra qualification of me being a vegetarian. Kind of forgot to mention that. Sorry.	2017-05-10 11:50:15Z	
12252	12263	Awesome. Thanks!	2017-05-10 20:42:17Z	
12240	12242	Interesting... I was targeting breaks as a straightforward intervention that would be easy to apply. Monitoring my daily noise dose seems like it might be quite complicated, are there suggestions for how to achieve this?	2017-05-08 19:25:25Z	
12240	12242	@AttRigh yes, but 80 dB is quite loud. If you are comfortable with low level music (e.g., 60 dB), the standards would say you can do that all day long.	2017-05-08 19:28:10Z	StrongBad
12240	12242	Thanks for the advice... I'm not sure I even know how to work out the noise level of my headphones in dB without some research, or whether I should take background noise into account or how I would do this given the noise isolation :/. I think I should perhaps rephrase a more general question.	2017-05-08 19:49:44Z

12199	12241	Thanks. Yes, I meant the middle-ear. The symptoms of Meniere's disease fits my profile to a tee though. Although the symptoms do seem to be very similar to a middle-ear infection, or aggravation caused by the sinuses.(?) None of the other complications seem like a good avenue, but thanks it all has value to me.	2017-05-08 20:24:40Z	
12194	12270	It's strange, you can keep a CGM system like the one discussed in my question here attached for a period of two weeks.  So I don't know why a pump can only be attached for a few days.	2017-05-11 00:23:39Z	
12194	12270	The linked study gets into much more detail than my answer so definitely check it out.  The main issues are insulin reservoir and skin reactions.  Most CGM units are much smaller than a pump and weigh much less. While it may seem ideal for your lifestyle to have a two weeks of use out of one site the toll it would take outweigh the convenience(per the manufacturers).	2017-05-12 21:01:31Z	Parker McA
12194	12270	Well, consider something like the I-port: medtronicdiabetes.com/products/i-port-advance It has no insulin in it, and it's as small as a CGM.  Yet it has to be replaced every three days.  It seems counterintuitive.	2017-05-12 21:29:27Z	
12194	12270	What's counter intuitive about that? I think it's counter intuitive to think having an open port, essentially a managed wound on the body, should be able to remain open for an arbitrarily longer amount of time due to your longing not to change a site. Have you read the linked study?	2017-05-15 17:17:34Z	Parker McA
12194	12270	Well, isn't a CGM equally a "managed wound on the body"?  So why would a CGM be able to be kept for two weeks when an I-Port can only be kept 3 days?  That's what seems counterintuitive.	2017-05-15 17:19:27Z	
12194	12544	Is the 20% worse thing only relevant to tube pumps, or is it also relevant to patch pumps and the I-port?	2017-06-06 17:17:58Z	
12194	12544	I want to say it is common to both, but I will confirm that. Let me ask the question directly on a few user forums and see what I find out in terms of anecdotal evidence. It will probably take me a couple of days.	2017-06-06 17:25:22Z	WestOfPecos
12194	12544	Ok.  By the way, since you've posted answers to all my other diabetes-related questions, can you take a look at my question here: health.stackexchange.com/q/12192/9100	2017-06-06 18:01:10Z	
12194	12544	OK, I asked: unconnected to the pump. Those reporting problems are spread on Tandem, Medtronic, Omnipod if you look up what they are using (I am sure I-port would generate same results at best): forum.fudiabetes.org/t/infusion-sites-how-long-do-yours-last/…	2017-06-06 23:22:18Z	WestOfPecos
12194	12544	I think it's possible that I-port might generate better results, because it could be that sending insulin constantly through a cannula does more damage to the cannula than just sending insulin through the cannula sporadically.	2017-06-08 21:45:08Z	
12193	12211	Good idea to simply call the technician and ask him what the heck he has written. I like your pragmatism.   Although I doubt that anyone is going to benefit from the answer due to it uniqueness (and I'd wish to be proven wrong), you get a +1 from me.

12156	12308	@Ryan from personal experience no you can't really tell since you're, well, caught up in the act and not really focused on those things. As for edited question I need to look for sources, my answer currently is not really good since it's all my own assumptions, common sense, and personal experience. If I won't find references, maybe better talk in chat where we can share "unproven" things without lowering the site's quality.	2017-06-17 07:53:11Z	Shadow Wizard
12155	12181	However, be aware that some critique that the relationship between plant-based diets and low risk of certain cancers is due to the fact that vegans and vegetarians tend to be more health conscious (ex. don't smoke, do more exercise) than meat eaters. Some studies have tried to take these factors into account and they still find a correlation.	2017-05-03 16:31:19Z	Leo
12155	12181	Just a link is insufficient as an answer. Could I ask you to summarise the findings of both meta analyses? Otherwise, this is in danger of being removed by mods as link-only answers are not tolerated.	2017-05-03 17:36:29Z	Narusan-in-coma

12103	12105	According to the wiki article, anyways, the Mifflin St. Jeor equation is one of the most accurate predictors (of an average) to date. The paper (pay barrier) is here and from the abstract it seems it was derived empirically, but the paper may have other details. My gut tells me it's too complex a subject to be concisely summarized, and so digging in to some of those papers might be your best bet for an explanation (the Harris ones, too). I suspect your case is due to an oversimplification regarding respiratory efficiency and its relation to BMR.	2017-04-27 20:18:06Z	Jason C
12103	12105	@JasonC Yeah, this will probably be the case. My gut tells me that I would be more likely to underestimate the number though than overestimating. Magnitude 2 is striking though. Thanks for the link, I'll have a read	2017-04-27 20:20:20Z	Narusan-in-coma
12103	12105	Btw you can get higher than 1200 with the Mifflin St. Jeor equation. If you plug in the proper age, weight, height, for whatever WebMD defined as the "average [fe]male" you'd probably get closer. Wikipedia's cited example number is for a 55-year old, 130 lb, 5'6" woman, which is much closer to WebMD's sedentary female number for that age. Also BMR has a strict set of criteria, so there's that, too. And WebMD uses a different equation. This seems to be one of those "fuzzy" things.	2017-04-27 20:29:30Z	Jason C

12085	12118	No, sorry, babies cannot grow new fingers. I'll stop there because your post is full of stuff like that. The one solid answer you provided was this: Listen to your doctor not stack exchange.	2017-04-29 04:12:12Z	Carey Gregory
12085	12118	Under normal conditions if a babies finger is cut off, that finger can be regrown.	2017-04-30 02:22:01Z	Gova DEster

12077	12078	Just wondering: Why did you ask a question and post the answer which is the same as your answer to the Athletes Fungus Question? If it was for reference for newcomers, I think that they will find the Athletes Question just by searching a few key words about disinfecting laundry. Then there is your Community Meta Question thread.	2017-04-26 16:40:32Z	Narusan-in-coma
12077	12078	I would recommend you to expand the latter and not simply recycle your old answer, as this is frowned upon by the community. Cheers.	2017-04-26 16:42:35Z	Narusan-in-coma
12077	12078	@Narusan: Good comments; thanks. Why did I post this question/answer pair? Because I did a Google search for [ how to disinfect laundry ] and saw how much poor advice came up.	2017-04-27 10:03:17Z	
12077	12078	@Narusan: Google shows a "featured snippet" which implies that vinegar is a sufficient disinfectant for laundry! In truth, diluting a cup of vinegar into your wash is the wrong course of action; see this comment and this source.	2017-04-27 10:03:37Z	
12077	12078	@Narusan:  A)  What's a "Community Meta Question thread"? B) I've now marked this answer as "community wiki". Does this assuage your concerns about recycling?	2017-04-27 10:05:50Z

12027	12051	While I agree that laparoscopy is percutaneous by definition, the more I am reading, it seems like all laparoscopic procedures are done by putting the scope in the void of the abdominal cavity to operate on various organs whereas other percutaneous endoscopic procedures involve putting a scope directly within the surgical site of interest. I cannot find definitive resources to back this up though.	2017-04-24 22:24:12Z

12027	12033	I can find a number of percutaneous endoscopic procedures that do not appear to involve routing through a blood vessel. For example: percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, percutaneous nephrolithitomy, percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy. Going through a blood vessel does not seem to be the distinguishing factor.	2017-04-23 12:25:45Z	
12027	12033	Been super busy.  If you want to make a note that sources are pending, I don't mind.	2017-04-25 02:08:39Z	Jude
12027	12033	Sources have been pending for 5 days now. It'd be great if you could update your answer and include them. This will probably alleviate the issue with the downvotes.	2017-04-27 20:05:04Z	Narusan-in-coma

11998	12015	It's the exact same link, and the link isn't the problem. The problem is we can't read it. In general, answers that are nothing more than a link are considered undesirable because links have a habit of going bad over time. Your complete answer needs to be in text here, not in a link to somewhere we can't get to now or 5 years from now. (You have enough rep elsewhere to know all this.)	2017-04-24 03:52:06Z	Carey Gregory
11998	12015	@CareyGregory, I see, I have added a link to another page, hoping this can be reached freely. Your point of providing text is very valid, however, I have zero medical experience and I am unable to provide scientific answer, I am the one who asked the question, so I could not elaborate more about the answer. When I added an Edit to the question, I was advised to create an answer. Your point is still valid though.	2017-04-24 10:52:36Z

11974	11975	@JimBalter I do have the same problem as Carey though. Citing from the question: why will the bodyweight eventually stabilize as the person would still be eating way less than what normal people eat?. Citing from the answer: Anyone who eats too few calories will eventually starve to death, whether they had surgery or not. This is lacking for me as well. Regarding the Answerer: Please look more deeply into the gastric bypass part of the question and explicitly refer to that part. This way, your answer will be more clear and improve in general.	2017-04-18 09:24:18Z	Narusan-in-coma

I was not aware of the high standards expected for referencing and sources, but will keep that in mind for the future. I'm not an expert on the topic, but I saw a logical error made and thought that this question could be disproven without expert knowledge.

11974	11975	Someone removed a lot of (mostly unpleasant) comments. If you just find a quote different to Wikipedia for the information there and maybe rephrase point one and two so that it is more clear, this will be more than enough to make this a sophisticated answer. It would be great if you could find the time to do that. No need for expert knowledge, it's just the site policy that forces us to request proper references.	2017-04-18 21:39:50Z	Narusan-in-coma

11855	11862	Thank you,. Maybe but my wife and I both thought it was similar to the name titanium.  By the time I thought yo just call the doc office back after googling for a couple hours they'd already closed.  I found this on the web.  Don't know if it is it or not. dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4391760/…	2017-04-08 12:45:36Z	
11855	11862	The only other element I can think of that sounds like titanium is vanadium, which is just the next element up in the periodic table, but I cannot find any articles that suggest it is used in hip replacements.	2017-04-08 18:08:01Z	BillDOe
11855	11862	Well I dunno, I'll have to call their office on Monday to try and find it out.	2017-04-08 21:44:31Z

11852	11859	I'm holding off accepting this answer because I'd like to see an answer from a surgeon ( not assuming the answerer is not a surgeon but did not identify as such ) who has done this surgery give their opinion for choice to remove stones or remove whole organ. This answer is logical. I want to see a surgeon address the risk of removing, or not, the gallbladder and removing, or not, the stones separate to it.	2017-04-11 07:03:49Z	
11852	11859	@authorized Maybe accept it now? There is no way for a surgeon to publicly prove she/he is a surgeon and the links provided are valid.

11756	11785	Why do you answer the question if you agree with Carey's comment? He explicitly stated that no-one should answer...	2017-04-01 12:04:47Z	Narusan-in-coma
11756	11785	@Narusan because he is only kind of right. For a medical consulting no answer should be given, but in the set of questions OP asks, it makes sense to give other kind of answers. In a comment you cannot share as much information. I then made an answer that tells that popping veins is normal, how it happens and that some even seek out such an effect. I then also pointed out that it can be something else because proper medical consulting should be done by a doctor because there is a possibility that it can be something worse and then just stating that it is normal is a bit bad comment/answer.	2017-04-04 08:00:28Z	user3644640
11756	11785	Then maybe state that in the beginning of your answer? This's would be less confusing for readers	2017-04-04 11:26:24Z	Narusan-in-coma
11756	11785	@Narusan that has no role in the factual part of the message that veins pop-out in stressed muscles and that compressing increases the effect. I think that it would be worth of a meta discussion if the health SE should have a warning sign: "Please consult your doctor not SE, if you feel that something is wrong in your or your acquaintance's body." In that way, it would not need to be reminded that it can always be something else because the veins can also be a symptom of some decease.	2017-04-04 14:39:03Z	user3644640

11754	11763	Excellent answer navigating the role of pathology in diagnosis.  Final diagnosis and treatment plan rarely are made independently from the physical exam and clinical history, about which the pathologist usually does not have a full discussion with the physician who ordered the biopsy.  Sometimes they will discuss after the pathologist reviews it - I've done that myself with pathologists radiologists specialists etc - to correlate findings.  And yes, it is always appropriate to ask a physician to explain further so that you understand your health and medical treatments!	2017-04-01 02:14:05Z	DoctorWhom
11751	11764	Good answer but not sure why you said you can't find a source claiming the pill protects against STIs. That's like saying you can't find a source claiming left is right or night is day. Just saying it that way implies it could be true, which is very misleading to someone who thinks it's possible.	2017-03-31 00:39:04Z	Carey Gregory
11751	11764	@CareyGregory I take your point. I guess my thinking was: if I said "it gives no barrier" and left it at that it's an unreferenced assertion; by saying there are no sources to back it up makes it clear I have looked for references-- basically, "it's not just me saying this"! If you have a better way of phrasing it I am open to suggestions :)	2017-03-31 06:27:21Z	bertieb
11751	11764	(I also think in play here is me not wanting to dismiss something out-of-hand; there could be some really subtle effect on uterine secretions, membrane integrity or something that gives a 0.1%/0.5%/1%/etc 'protection'. Scientist at heart!)	2017-03-31 06:29:41Z	bertieb

11740	11772	A great answer (+1). I just don't quite get what do you mean by "but ibuprofen/NSAIDs can't be safe!" It seems from the context that you are referring to COX2 inhibitors not being safe, not ibuprofen. Is it a slip or am I reading something wrong?	2017-04-12 18:28:34Z	Lucky

11714	11803	@Narusan, what!? I see participants in many Stack Exchange communities using Wikipedia articles as reference sources. It's not as if the contents of orange juice are a big esoteric secret.	2017-04-04 16:47:12Z	BillDOe

11710	11712	In my opinion, a link to a reliable source stating that Astrophobia does exist and listing a few symptoms (although the term really is self explanatory) would be sufficient.	2017-03-28 19:05:06Z	Narusan-in-coma

11662	11716	Ah, my bad; on closer inspection you did say about that sensation. Is it like pins-and-needles? Any numbness?	2017-03-28 21:25:25Z	bertieb
11662	11716	It's like pins and needles but painless. Not numb at all	2017-03-28 21:25:53Z	
11662	11716	I agree to en extent- part of the reason it is worth going is because there can be other, less benign causes. That said, my advice was to go seek expert opinion if it bothers you or is causing suffering in some way :) Beyond some exercises - basically, stretches - I'm not sure what else to offer. Even if you are standing, it is usually possible to move about some- what works for pain may also work for paraesthesia!	2017-03-28 22:08:36Z	bertieb
11662	11716	@Narusan I have updated this answer to reflect the main focus of your question- on the sensation you get (there is still some overlap as we are still talking about the back). Apologies again for the confusion on my part; hopefully this addresses your issue more directly.	2017-03-31 12:35:17Z	bertieb
11662	11716	@Mods: as noted, I left in the section on back pain as there may be those coming from eg a Google search who have an altered sensation with back pain; so it may be relevant given the wider context. If it's off-topic or distracting I can remove, of course.	2017-03-31 12:36:29Z	bertieb

11635	11669	Mushrooms are high in protein and low in fats and carbs. IIRC, mushrooms contain more essential amino acids than plants. The tricky thing is, many mushrooms are poisonous. So, to find edible mushrooms, it may be best to go to your local grocery store. Pine nuts contain a lot of fat and about equal amounts of protein and carbs. Also, indigenous people in Asia, Africa, and South America may consume a lot of bugs.	2017-03-24 13:41:35Z	Double U
11635	11649	You said to avoid wheat, gluten and dairy but the authority nutrition link you sourced says to eat high fat dairy. The same link also says to eat fruit when you said you should cut down on it. I can understand some juice drinks as those made from concentrate can contain added sugar but unadulterated fresh fruit juice should be fine surely. Plus fresh citrus juices contain vitamin C	2017-03-24 23:34:39Z	Chris
11635	11649	When it comes down to it sugar is sugar, fruit is basically sugar with some fiber in it, better than pure sugar bit nonetheless. I only put in those links as guides if you wanted definite links. My opinion to avoid wheat gluten/wheat and dairy is based on other sources which I didn't have much time to get sources for. See the book titled "Wheat Belly" by Dr. Davis.	2017-03-26 01:48:02Z	larry909
11635	11649	Please do present the evidence sources for giving advice on avoiding gluten/wheat, as this is a hot topic right now without a lot of solid evidence. There is evidence for whole grains being better than flours due to glycemic index for one, fiber and protein for another.  Also fruit is absolutely far more than sugar with fiber. Yes some have more nutrition than others, but even diabetics are recommended to eat fruit in moderation. The value of fruit juice varies depending on the fruit, and yes some of the nutrition (and fiber) is left behind when squeezing fruit into juice.	2017-04-25 06:07:21Z	DoctorWhom

11661	11668	My stent was inserted through my right arm. It healed fast, almost within a day or two and left no scars. The technology is improving. I had two pit stops on the marathon, non the less I finished 5:54 hrs., very close to my last year's time.	2017-03-24 00:33:23Z	
11661	11668	This is actually your most complete answer. To add slightly on the marathon and stent stats... Your typical stent/CABG/MI/et cetera  patient hasn't even contemplated a marathon. Most patients with cardiac issues have them from lifestyle choices. Be it a less than ideal diet, lack of exercise, substance abuse, diabetes, and so on and so on. You and others like you are an exception to the rule. If you are familiar with statistics... most of the time studies aren't deemed satisfactory if the participant pool (n) is less than 50. @bertieb is correct - consult a physician!	2017-03-24 18:28:05Z	BryceH

On HealthSE answers need to be evidence-based and generally provide reference to the source you used for information. A complete answer would include more information and a source or two so the reader can look more into it.

11617	13479	Btw I saw another answer you gave - if you're a healthcare professional, I completely understand that it may be a little frustrating at first because we are used to giving well-educated advice all the time.  But since this site can't validate users' credentials, there's no way to know whether someone is the Surgeon General or a middle school student when they present info.  I was rocky at it in the beginning, but when I got the hang of it, I developed an appreciation that it strives to set some academic standards!

11543	11555	I see nothing wrong with linking to Wikipedia for basic information such as "gestation is measured from LMP, not conception." It's not like it's the hot-of-the-presses result of a new study. It's a pretty basic fact, and it's at the heart of the "couldn't have been me, was probably the ex two weeks earlier" theory of the OP. All the other stuff about whether ultrasounds can get gestation right is irrelevant since all involved agree about when the LMP was anyway.	2017-03-22 11:32:46Z	Kate Gregory

11530	13393	your explanation of SPF is wrong. SPF 15 does not mean it will last 15 minutes. It means it will take 15 times as long to get a sunburn. I can get a sunburn from 10 minutes of exposure: SPF15 means I will get one after 2.5 hrs. I will get damage to some extent if I am out for less than that time. I personally wear 100+ when I am out. All sunscreens wear off, especially if you're sweating, rubbing yourself with a towel etc, and should be reapplied every hour or two regardless of their strength.	2017-08-21 18:49:51Z	Kate Gregory

11523	11542	Before I could up-vote this, I would need the quotation actually tied to authoritative source, otherwise I think it gives a false presentation of "authority."  For your convenience, here's one: "Also, in general, it is best to buy a product that includes only those medicines you really need. If you have questions about which product to buy, check with your pharmacist." Part of my up-vote campaign.	2017-06-21 15:07:35Z	Atl LED
11523	11540	I appreciate the response but it seems like you didn't actually answer the question that was asked?

For example, might I overdose on the inactive ingredients, or might they interact dangerously?"	2017-03-14 05:23:41Z	
11523	11540	Apart from the answer being slightly off, we also appreciate verifiable sources such as links to well known websites. No one can tell if you are a pharmacist. Furthermore, it would be great if you could include information on the countries your answer is based on. I'm supposing USA because of FDA, but more info would be great!	2017-03-14 14:34:14Z	Narusan-in-coma

11513	11519	I lost between 3 to 4 units of blood because of an ulcer and passed out because of blood loss. Had my wife not been here, I most likely would have laid on the floor and died. The ulcer was most likely the result of years of taking Naproxen. It was not because of any other risk factors, i.e. h. Pylori, GERD, etc.	2017-03-13 22:07:54Z	BillDOe

11513	11529	@Lucky well in this case my source was my Histology teacher. Should I post it in the comments instead?	2017-03-13 16:33:16Z	Filipe Rocha
11513	11529	@FilipeRocha- If you have a histology teacher, and you got this information from them, ask them for a reference to look it up. We would like something a little more concrete than "My teacher said".	2017-03-14 15:11:59Z	JohnP

11511	11512	Bracket is not removed. It is held in place by the wire since other braces are intact. Thus, the damaged bracket is sliding over the wire.	2017-03-12 18:13:00Z	
11511	11512	You can remove the bracket it will not harm anything	2017-03-12 19:36:54Z	Christopher
11497	11498	Thanks for your answer! Do you have a link to that publication?	2017-03-12 11:07:42Z

11492	11771	Thank you for finding this. This study is significant for me because of receded gums (caused by my overbrushing 20 years ago) which expose dentin.  I'll try to apply the strips to my enamel only whenever possible.	2017-03-31 16:25:32Z	
11490	11491	There is a bit of contradiction. On one hand you say that I should not care. At the same time, you say about supplementary potassium. Do you mean that the only way to shift the balance is with saline in hospital (so that they will care about it)?	2017-03-11 07:03:03Z	
11490	11491	Yes. Severe electrolyte disturbances are very uncommon in healthy people (i.e. those who don't take kidney medication or have severe diarrhoea/vomiting). And even then, if you're not frail you'll probably recover quickly. They only measure your electrolyte levels in a hospital, and they'll take care of any disturbances.	2017-03-11 08:10:28Z	Jasper
11490	11491	Does it make any sense to add any Na(Cl) into the food without K?	2017-03-12 07:22:59Z	
11490	11491	People do it for taste; medically it's in most cases not necessary. On the contrary, it's been linked to high blood pressure.	2017-03-12 11:23:07Z	Jasper
11490	11491	The reason saline is made with sodium is because sodium is the main electrolyte found in the extra-cellular fluid, and largely responsible for maintaining the plasma osmolarity. Potassium, on the other hand, is very abundant INSIDE the cells. What Jasper said is largely correct. We add salt for taste and not because we actually need to. And yes, overconsumption of salt is directly related to hypertension.	2017-03-14 23:29:10Z	Gregorio Litenstein

11469	11471	@OgnianMirev The key here is sustained aerobic exercise, and running does it. (And FYI, all-out sprinting is not what I meant. Slower and steady.)	2017-03-09 16:16:26Z	Mike Waters

Unfortunately, I don't have the time to do it here.   That's why I decided not to provide any more answers last March 14th.   Thank you.	2017-05-08 00:48:46Z	Centaurus

11458	11676	I understand Pavlicev and Wagner differently: Though female orgasms originally developed as a way to induce ovulation, they don't serve this purpose in mammals anymore (due to the development of spontaneous orgasms), but are maintained since they serve secondary functions. So there is no need to be afraid to run out of eggs ;)	2017-03-24 20:56:55Z	Marzipanherz
11458	11676	So based one what yo are saying here, could female masturbation increase her ability to conceive but she may have a shorter window of time during her life that she can conceive? (Theoretically at least)	2017-03-28 15:41:28Z	L.B.

11436	11439	Let us continue this discussion in chat.	2017-03-06 21:45:53Z	
11436	11439	Great answer! In my view, most of your references (aside from the last one) actually point to the fact that omitting sugar (sucrose and glucose) actually prevents cavities, and a xylitol substitute achieves that. As for the obsolete comments, you can always flag them, the mods will remove them. (You can just flag one, they will look at the whole string).	2017-03-22 18:18:17Z	Lucky
11436	11439	@Lucky Edited my answer to make clear what I meant: You eat carbohydrates and therefore polysaccharides anyway! If you don't bush your teeth, xylitol is not gonna help you because there are other stains. If you do brush your teeth, the benefits from xylitol are rather marginal, according to the studies.	2017-03-22 19:02:44Z	Narusan-in-coma
11431	11433	+1 for pointing the OP towards other types of fruit. I would like to add that some vegetables, such as bell peppers are also a great source of vitamin C and contain other useful phytochemicals (although not the same ones as citrus fruits).	2017-03-06 12:40:13Z	Lucky
11424	11426	+1 for see your dentist immediately. This is the most important thing the OP should do right now!	2017-03-06 06:05:46Z	Narusan-in-coma
11420	11787	Hmm maybe you could include more sources, to offer a bit of the insight into the controversy?	2018-01-17 02:17:24Z	Dave Liu
11416	11417	So the best I can do to prevent hair loss is just avoiding too "traumatic" hair styles (too tight hair ties)?	2017-03-06 08:25:13Z	
11416	11417	If you see signs of hair loss, go see your doctor. There are treatments that can slow down or stop all hair loss. The answer was targeted towards long hair being a risk factor, which it really isn't.	2017-03-06 22:37:52Z	KCasper
11412	11428	what can I do to change it?	2017-03-06 03:36:17Z	
11412	11428	Well most of factors aren't safe to tamper with. You'll need to boost your activity levels to get most of your metabolism. Anaerobic exercise is the best option (for ex weightlifting) as you will increase your activity levels and muscle mass at the same time.  Also be sure to eat well, low calorie diets will decrease metabolism.	2017-03-06 03:40:02Z	holyknight
11412	11428	so, anaerobic exercise is for increasing BMR, but aerobic - for decreasing?	2017-03-06 03:45:04Z	
11412	11428	no, both will increase BMR. But overall anaerobic will do better.	2017-03-06 03:46:02Z	holyknight
11411	13512	Excellent response. Of note, for psychotherapy, it's primarily cognitive behavioral therapy that has the strongest evidence for efficacy.	2017-09-06 09:27:45Z	DoctorWhom
11411	13512	@DoctorWhom Thanks for your feedback. I'll append that to the body	2017-09-06 09:46:35Z	
11409	11418	Okay. Interesting. As a follow up question, could humans survive and thrive on a Gorilla's diet?	2017-03-07 14:31:52Z	
11409	11418	I edited my answer to answer this follow up question. In short: I think humans could survive but not thrive on such a diet. But colonic fermentation  in humans does not seem to be well understood yet, and there would probably be interesting experiments to do.	2017-03-09 09:27:37Z	Tetramino
11392	11393	While this is true with every policy I've ever had, I don't believe there's anything preventing a company from writing policies with different rules. Insurance is a contract. The terms are whatever the contract says they are.	2017-03-04 00:42:46Z	Carey Gregory

11384	11386	might add that A,D,E,and K vitamins are fat soluble, so your body holds onto them longer.  Yes D can be taken like that, but that is not usually indicated unless there's deficiency.  Vitamins and minerals are cofactors and enzyme components and all sorts of things in your body. You CAN overdose on many of them.	2017-04-02 00:53:41Z	DoctorWhom

11375	11376	I agree that you want to be really careful messing with the acid/base balance in your body. Your blood pH is carefully regulated by your kidneys and lungs, and outside 7.35-7.45 it can be harmful.  In this case, the reason the pH of your urine changes because your kidneys are trying to normalize your blood pH. I don't know the toxic dose of baking soda, probably more than a tsp - - but the pharmacokinetics of the acid/base properties of any chemical also depends on the health of your kidneys and the ability of your respiratory system to compensate.	2017-04-01 23:57:11Z	DoctorWhom

11363	11374	Thanks for clarifying. Could you please tell what according to research is defined as Above Normal Memory. Let  it be related scientific , mathematical skills or remembering education ( that you got previously) and less on social skills ( because they can be more relative. I mean I want to know what is a sort of barrier ( set by research) between , Bad ( but not falling under any disease category) ,Ok , Normal and Above Normal Memory and Retention Capacity. A bit of your thought or a link to such a paper shall suffice	2017-03-02 07:01:29Z	
11344	11352	That quote is a bunch of meaningless gibberish, by the way. "Vital  energy field???" Come on.	2017-05-21 11:41:08Z	Ernest Friedman-Hill
11344	11352	The first ten words start out excellent. Then there are some little gems hidden in a lot of unproven assertions without reliable sources for the claims. Please update this answer, ideally also inspired by this post.	2017-12-08 12:50:53Z	LangLangC
11344	11352	What are you talking about exactly? Plastic containers can have BPA or other Bisphenols even if it says BPA free, do I really need to prove everything that's alredy very well known everywhere?  On a sidenote;the accepted answer states no sources for any claim with some pretty serious claims.	2017-12-08 23:22:58Z	HerbalResearcher
11344	11352	Talking about this answer (btw: 'accept'= only OP controls that): you 'promised' more sources for backup, 'microwaving-dangerous' needs much better backup on all points given, 'vital energy field' is unscientific -> unprovable meaningfully; BPA&co in plastic (which always leaks when harmful stuff is present) declared safe is a valid/indirect point, manufacturers cannot be trusted at face value, stuff needs to be tested independently. But "well known": this is obviously somewhat contestable with the info you present. Most regard microwaves completely safe, "google it" is not answer.	2017-12-19 10:06:55Z	LangLangC
11341	11355	Deaths would be better, and deaths are inevitable given the disease load above. Perhaps a standard of 'years lost'. Either way it translates to decreased life expectancy. The data provided by CDC is often unreliable or skewed to make things appear 'better' than they are.	2017-02-28 16:25:40Z	
11341	11355	Also, t's easier to notice that people have non-fatal health problems when, as a country, you're spending more on checkups, screening & monitoring patients, etc. It's easier for people with actual problems to go undiagnosed if they're going to the doctor less often (which was the case in 1995 as compared to today). I agree that systematic biases like this, and like the sort of bias that might conceivably be born out of poor incentives the CDC, seem hard to explicitly adjust for in a principled way.	2017-03-01 08:27:53Z	Casey
11340	11348	OCD does not have to take up a significantly large part of the day so to make sweeping statements on someone's health without the means to properly diagnose is a dangerous thing to do.  My advice to @Person is to seek professional advice with a trained person like your doctor who can properly go through things in a clinical manner	2017-02-28 22:24:41Z	Chris
11340	11348	its and OR not and AND. Also the criteria defined by DSM-IV say that OCD episodes to be clinical need to mess up with your daily activities.	2017-02-28 22:30:36Z	holyknight
11340	11348	It is currently DSM-5 which is used for diagnoses.  DSM-IV is out of date	2017-02-28 22:40:00Z	Chris
11340	11348	DSM-5 it's still not widely accepted, many professionals are still using prior editions as reference. Also the DSM works incrementally, DSM-5 won't just dump everything that had DSM-IV. It's just a revision and update.	2017-02-28 23:14:15Z	holyknight
11337	11677	How about a reference to support that? It is a rather short answer...	2017-03-26 07:54:18Z	Lucky
11333	11335	The calcium complex, with vitamine D,magnesium , and K2MK7 or MK4 and K1 from leafy vegetables,silica,boron,vitamin C , and avoid taking cofee and phytic acid with calcium complex(or at least 4-6 hours separated). Avoid taking phosphoric acid at all time(soda).  Brush your teeth often and everytime you eated something. Find your natural way of inhibiting Streptococcus mutans	2017-02-28 14:47:32Z	HerbalResearcher

11331	11365	You don't have to exercise at a professional level to have a BMI that is completely misleading and incorrect. Any heavily-built athlete will easily have a high BMI even with low body fat. And BMIs get used by far more than just a personal physician who can see you and knows your actual status. They are also used by -- for example -- insurance companies to make coverage and rate decisions about you, and they most certainly don't know that you're not obese despite your obese BMI. It's a crap measure.	2017-03-01 05:21:24Z	Carey Gregory
11331	11365	@CareyGregory I've added the problem you mentioned about insurance companies.	2017-03-01 05:59:37Z	Count Iblis
11331	11365	I feel sorry for Asian athletes.	2017-03-01 06:14:48Z	Carey Gregory
11331	11365	@CareyGregory I've added a bit more, the two sources quoted by the OP should be considered in more detail, and then you'll see that the actual proposals are quite reasonable. The problem exist at the macro-level, the health care system is strained because people don't eat a healthy diet. If people were to start eating healthy, everyone would eat 800 grams of fruits and vegetables, cut down on meat and fat, how many billions of dollars would that save society how much more resources would then be available to treat the remaining patients?	2017-03-01 06:35:27Z	Count Iblis
11331	11365	If you happen to believe that added fat and lack of exercise are responsible for the obesity epidemic, your first added paragraph makes sense. I do not believe that. I disagree that athletes won't be rejected for certain medical procedures due to BMI requirements because such rejections can happen without the screener ever seeing the patient.	2017-03-01 14:45:40Z	Carey Gregory
11327	11361	Don't keep your honey and water mixed for long periods of time; however, it will ferment and possibly mold.	2017-02-28 18:23:50Z	L.B.
11327	11361	No, just add honey in lukewarm water and drink it instantly, it is not for storage, we never add honey to water to store it in Asia or our drinking water bottles, it is another thing to add it to the ayurvedic medicines. Thanks, I did not know this.	2017-02-28 18:28:21Z	uzma

11310	11314	yh but what about the implant, will the implant get to like 10C if the weather is -20C or something. And if yes, how will that affect the surrounding tissue.	2017-02-25 21:17:03Z	
11310	11314	@J.Doe 10C is extreme hypothermia, probably not survivable if the implant is anywhere in the core of the body. I wouldn't worry about implants if the wearer gets that cold.	2017-02-25 21:19:39Z	Carey Gregory
11310	11314	@CareyGregory the implant is in the medullar canal of the tibia. what if i purposely wanted to bring the temperature of the implant to around 10C. The idea is that if the temperature of the implant reduces, it will contract and become easier to pull out during surgery. Would placing an ice pack on the leg suffice to reduce the temperature of the implant, or is there another way of cooling it? thanks	2017-02-25 21:42:20Z	
11310	11314	Dude, physics. Most likely the implant will never experience a significant variation of temperature, precisely because it will be in the medullary canal, isolated from the outside. Heat will be maintained more-or-less stable by conduction from the surrounding tissue.	2017-02-25 21:48:23Z	Gregorio Litenstein
11310	11314	@GregorioLitenstein alright so there's no way of cooling the implant by 10 degrees without damaging surrounding tissue before an operation to remove it? I'm asking because it was suggested by a research paper. intechopen.com/books/…	2017-02-25 21:52:48Z

11295	11302	I agree, but make sure you ask for a hand specialist.  Orthopedic surgeons sometimes end up becoming focused on different areas.  I say this both from personal experience and from working with ortho colleagues. You could have injured one of the ligaments/tendons.  They can guide treatment, which as Gregorio stated, isn't necessarily surgery just because they're surgeons.	2017-02-25 02:42:05Z	DoctorWhom
11295	11302	That's definitely a good point. If you can't get a hand specialist, a general orthopedic surgeon will probably do as well; just, make sure not to get somebody specialized in a different body area.	2017-02-25 04:09:03Z	Gregorio Litenstein
11295	11302	Thank you! But isn't carpal tunnel syndrome usually painful? In my case nothing ever hurts, only that finger is weaker than the others, gets tired easier and feels like I lose control of it if I put excesive strain on it while playing.	2017-02-25 09:57:15Z	
11295	11302	It usually hurts, which is why I said it's not the most classical presentation, but the underlying cause is a nerve being compressed. I am a physician, but not a specialist.

11259	11700	I do and I used to take vitamin D as well (prescribed by a neurologist) but then my nutritional therapist told me not to (apart from the fact that it had been prescribed to me together with calcium even though both medications stated you shouldn't take them together with the other one :) Thank you very much, I had exercised less last days due to my business and I've been experiencing more stings, both when I excercised and when I got embarrassed.	2017-03-27 14:10:44Z

11257	11258	I fall sometimes because it just feels as if there are no bones in my leg, and it is made up of some weak, flimsy material. I do feel the "pins and needle" pain at times, but that is manageable	2017-02-22 19:06:43Z	
11257	11258	Well, this very much sounds to a pinched nerve in my humble opinion. I would visit a doctor, treatment is available and usually not very difficult.	2017-02-22 19:08:06Z	Narusan-in-coma

11241	11245	"Muscle is muscle" -- What accounts for the massive difference between "muscle" and "heart" in the cal/lb summary list?	2017-02-21 16:11:24Z	Jason C
11241	11245	You correctly assert that the heart is a muscle. However, the heart is pumping constantly and so the 'at rest' calorie/lb consumption in the table will be higher than  bicep muscle (truly) at rest where it is only just existing.	2017-02-21 16:23:51Z	JJosaur
11241	11245	So you are saying that if two persons have the same amount of  muscle mass they would burn the same amount of fat, although one of them is 3 times stronger than the other? This happened to me once. I met a guy who could lift 2-3 times what I could, although his muscle size was about as big as mine. Also, I had a look at your references and they don't seem to check out if there is a difference between big and strong muscles in fat burn. But maybe I missed something. If you would have found some original research about this I would have upvoted your answer.	2017-02-22 01:46:46Z	
11241	11245	That is exactly what I am saying. BRM is a well studied area  and biology dictates the tautology I made at the end of my answer be correct.	2017-02-22 07:47:54Z	JJosaur
11241	11245	@Constantthin - There is a difference between big and strong muscle. The bigger muscle will burn more calories. Strength (As JJ notes) is a function of activation, not size. If you look at google scholar, there are several studies that show age related decrease in BMR is directly attributed to decrease in muscle size. If person A has 100 lbs of muscle mass, and person B has 75 lbs of muscle mass, person A will have a higher BMR even if they both have 1 rep maximum lifts of the same weight.	2017-06-04 17:44:58Z	JohnP

11230	11238	It was indeed "infective mononucleosis" (I've edited the question). Thank you for reassuring me. I'm quite the scaredy–cat sometimes! I shouldn't read as much articles on the web, like i'm doing now.... :)	2017-02-21 07:59:57Z	
11220	11232	Thanks for your answer! The thing is I'm trying to explain these things to my mother, who graduated from medical university. She remembers really well things she was taught. And these are her main argument - her knowledge and medical  books from USSR. And Internet resources don't convince her much (cause obviously people writing articles don't have medical degree). As for DOMS I encountered the articles stating that there are just hypothesis about sources of delayed onset muscle sorness. So I was wondering if there is some other litreture about it.	2017-02-22 02:45:59Z	
11220	11232	There is literature but a lot of it is conflicting as its still not well understood. Leading theories suggest it is the bodies protective reaction due to the sudden micro trauma of large sections of muscle.	2017-02-22 07:50:04Z	JJosaur
11213	11336	This is helpful. To be clear, would you agree that it is sloppy for people to use these terms interchangeably? For example if I am really referring to the "habitual bite" position, would it be correct to call this "maximum intercuspation" because it is a dental position, and not call it "centric occlusion" because the jaw might not be centered in this position? My confusion arises because some papers seem to use the terms interchangeably, or use the term "centric occlusion" when it seems like maximum intercuspation is more appropriate.	2017-02-28 11:09:20Z	
11213	11336	agreed, since are not interchageable. Hence CO = MIC + both mandibular condyle in the upper and forward position in the fossa with the disk between both surfaces. If you found the answer useful click on answered or useful.	2017-03-02 14:58:15Z	sergiouribe
11204	15301	It still is strange to me that nobody picked this up in the last 10 years, with more triptanes available at a better price (as far as I know, of course, I only know what they cost for the customer) and more studies done in the meantime.	2018-02-12 11:48:08Z

11182	11185	Other than the bacteria I think he was looking at things like BPA.  Regarding sanitizing bottles, hot water is good for short term, but at least every few days the bottle itself should probably be washed ,depending on how much contact it has with your mouth - more often if you suck on a spout versus pouring it into your mouth without touching it (yes people do that)	2017-09-15 07:19:09Z	DoctorWhom
11140	11151	I asked this question just to get an information because no doctor is able to detect the problem as the test results are normal. Are we missing something. If the test results are normal, then why he is behaving like that. Thank you.	2017-02-14 01:35:27Z	
11140	11151	Are there any diseases that can be detected only when they occurred and not when he is normal.	2017-02-14 01:37:32Z

11082	11084	Thank you. I have friends that tell me i'm doing the wrong thing by taking pills when i have a migraine attack, and i should let it heal naturally (what the ...???) Is it possible that my body gets used to this medicine and not being effective anymore? should i change my medicine periodically or not?	2017-02-08 07:37:16Z	
11082	11084	@JackJohansson Tell your jackass of a friend that he needs to try a migraine on for size before he dispenses advice to other people on how they should treat theirs. There is no "natural healing" to be done with migraines. No, you don't need to rotate the medicine. Keep using what works for you.	2017-02-08 14:49:49Z	Carey Gregory

11082	11084	I'd like to restate something in this answer: There is a danger for addiction, but only in the sense that you might decide that hey, these pills make me feel so good, why not have some more? That psychological effect could lead to frequent enough (ab)use that a physiological addiction develops as well. It definitely isn't possible if the rate stays the same, though.	2017-02-09 01:26:16Z	Nic Hartley
11082	11084	Precisely. Whenever i take one, i feel like hey it's working for me, i can do better after taking them! but then i realize this is the beginning of addiction, so : NO!	2017-02-11 06:46:59Z	
11082	11126	Also i need to mention that i have the same feeling about the coffee/dark tea too. Although i feel good and sharp after having a coffee, but i don't like to depend on anything, so i just don't drink them much too.	2017-02-11 06:50:55Z

10977	11017	@BrunoSchiavo For that to happen the fluid in the tissue would have to be under greater pressure than your diastolic BP. I think that much pressure would cause you to be blown up like a balloon.

10943	10946	@A. Bourgoin Can you explain your answer in a bit detail????..... As far as I can understand, if the penetrating object is in the lungs region, then it should be removed, otherwise not. Am I correct ?????  I am sorry but I find your answer ambiguous .....	2017-01-26 09:26:51Z	
10943	10946	If the object is totally occluding the airway and the subject cannot breath at all, then you could remove it but it is not recommanded by any safety organization I'm aware of. The lungs are extremely vascularized and removing an object in the lung can drown the subject in its blood. It is actually better to follow first-aid formation and be able to perform emergency tracheotomy if the wound obstruct the upper airway as many extremely important vessel are found around the trachea.	2017-01-26 09:31:08Z	A.

10923	10924	Jan is correct. But be aware that not everyone burns 2000 a day - many people are closer to 1700-1800.  Depends on your resting metabolic rate (which increases with greater muscle mass) and your level of activity, plus it tends to be lower the older you get OR if you've lost a lot of weight in the past.  It's important to keep your diet balanced especially when you're eating fewer calories, focusing on highly nutrient-dense foods (not calorie-dense). Also, it's recommended not to go below 1200 calories a day without a health provider's guidance.	2017-01-25 05:57:28Z	DoctorWhom

If it is screening, usually it is just one test.  Do remember that you have about 5 Liters (5,000 mL) of blood in your body, as well as other fluid in your tissues, so 4 mL is a very small amount relatively.	2017-02-24 06:21:07Z	DoctorWhom

10870	10874	Hi thanx for your interresting participation,I know about the resonant chamber potential problem, but for example the hat would be tight and not a helmet with gaps. For the heavy part it would not be that heavy,since I can use filaments/fine mesh of nickel and giron doesnt weight alot.  Could you precise why I need heavy--> light nuclei ?  Also since it's blocking magnetic fields, that should not be a problem, right ? Unless there is some of the frequencies stated that are only electrical and not magnetic,which would be easier to shield anyway and alredy taken care of with the materials.	2017-01-20 02:31:09Z	
10870	10874	Some waves will go through your head, making the tightness of the hat irrelevant. The thickness of the materials is important. The thinner the material, the less EM it will filter. You want heavy to light nuclei because different frequencies are better filtered out by different sizes of atoms. The variation helps you to cover a broader range of frequencies.  Electromagnetism is transmitted by photons. Electricity is the flow of electrons. I don't see why you'd want to shield from electricity. Just don't build an electrical charge on yourself.	2017-01-20 04:47:28Z	Sasha
10870	10874	If the shield is properly done the waves are not supposed to go through it since the magnetism would be blocked.  Of course it will be thick. The skin depth and magnetic permeability won't be penetrated.	2017-01-21 01:31:50Z	
10870	10874	Well, think about this: if there is any gap in the shield on your body, photons will go through your body. If the angle at which they enter puts them on a path to hit the inside of the shield, they will then bounce around inside your body instead of just passing through. If they happen to be a frequency which is resonant within the cavity they are trapped in, they will become far more destructive than they would be if they were just passing through you.	2017-01-21 17:47:32Z	Sasha
10870	10874	I believe a class in electromagnetism would be very helpful to you. Unfortunately, I do not have time to be an instructor, but as a start, there are many lectures available via MIT. ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/…	2017-01-28 08:49:54Z	Sasha
10870	11315	Reliable references?	2017-02-27 06:59:05Z	Lucky
10863	10866	Thanks, Jan! I found that very helpful! Do you happen to know what percentage of people who had acute attacks later develop chronic pancreatitis?	2017-01-19 21:52:00Z	
10863	10866	@Jan, what are the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis? Would it be about the same as acute pancreatitis, but on a milder (and obviously long-lasting) level?	2017-01-19 21:53:35Z	Pills N Pillows
10863	10866	No. If you have chronic pancreatitis now, it should be obvious from certain blood tests (a doctor should know). You have mentioned another recent attack for which the exact cause was not established...But surely, something was written into your medical documentation. Try to obtain that first and read what they said it is or isn't. Another option is to ask for an ultrasound or MRI of the pancreas to check for eventual cysts or damage by that hemorrhage.	2017-01-19 21:58:28Z	Jan
10863	10866	Chronic pancreatitis - it can be a wide range from barely noticeable to disabling. Read few articles: Mayo Clinic, NIDKK or so...	2017-01-19 22:00:25Z	Jan
10859	10867	Thanx, and forgot to tell that carrots can easily get you 100% of vitamin A, they also give beta carotene.	2017-01-21 00:30:16Z	HerbalResearcher

10846	10848	This has potential to be a good answer but it's completely lacking sources. For example, if you know of studies showing it's safe, cite one of them. And who says filbertone is safe? Cite that too.	2017-01-19 02:09:42Z	Carey Gregory
10845	10849	Would you mind explaining what type of infections in the intestines that cause diarrhea? So I know what to tell my Dr. when I speak to him.	2017-01-18 23:06:33Z	
10845	10849	@PillsNPillows You don't need to explain to a physician what causes diarrhea. They will explain that to you.	2017-01-19 02:05:08Z	Carey Gregory
10845	10849	Although sweating may go with fevers, the question asks about sweating that occurs "moments before and during" the bout of diarrhea. That's not how the sweating from a fever occurs; it is continuous.	2017-01-19 02:07:13Z	Carey Gregory
10818	10864	Do you have any reputable scientific references for this claim? It is my understanding that, when used properly (i.e. not overheated or scratched) PTFE (aka, Teflon if you're DuPont) coated cookware is perfectly safe. Here is [one:] (swac.web.unc.edu/thepipettepen/…)	2017-01-19 19:37:19Z	BillDOe
10818	10864	I found one study that links 12 studies donate.ewg.org/images/ewg_teflontempinfo_c02.pdf At 680° F (360 degres celcius) Easily attainable on stove...! Toxic gasses released: TFE (tetrafluoroethylene) animal carcinogen HFP (hexafluoropropene) worker toxicant TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) poisonous to plants DFA (difluoroacetic acid) Animal kidney toxicant MFA (monofluoroacetic acid) lethal to humans at low doses PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) animal carcinogen	2017-01-21 17:23:10Z	HerbalResearcher
10818	10864	While 680° might be easily attainable on a stove, it is almost never encountered during normal cooking. And we're talking about normal PTFE, not the byproducts it produces when overheated.	2017-01-21 20:34:30Z	BillDOe
10818	10864	Alot of people cook on the highest setting so yes it is encountered in normal cooking. This is a concern also for stainless,iron or aluminium recipients. Theres not only PTFE, and we're talking about cookware in general.	2017-01-22 03:47:32Z	HerbalResearcher
10818	10864	Palm oil has a smoke point of 455°F and auto-ignites a few degrees above that, so I hope anyone cooking on a pot heated to 680°F isn't using anything but 30w crankcase oil.	2017-01-23 02:48:30Z	BillDOe

10800	10979	Thank you for the link, but the number of pieces of fruit was just an example.  Perhaps I shouldn't have even given a number in the question, as I guess my question boils down to "If the body is able to turn a certain food into energy quickly, are you better off eating that food shortly before exercise"	2017-01-29 23:37:14Z	
10796	10834	(+1) and accepted as an answer with many thanks. I am opting to forego the proc and will use a FIT test ever 6 months to a year from now on. If I go to a less corporate-owned country I might get a procedure there after about 5 years but probably not. It's simply too invasive.	2017-01-17 15:03:46Z	
10796	10834	@WoundedEgo, you should still consider colonoscopy at some time. FIT test detects only the presence blood in the stool. Not all colorectal cancers bleed.	2017-01-17 15:34:58Z	Jan
10796	10834	"FIT-DNA" can also detect cancer cells, yes, but "FIT" test only blood.	2017-01-18 11:58:31Z	Jan
10796	10834	No, this only detects blood. "Globulin" is a protein - in this case it means "hemoglobin" from red blood cells. Colorectal Cancer, Diverticulitis, Crohn's Disease, IBD...they often cause bleeding, so the test confirms blood, not DNA from cancerous cells. "FIT" test can detect only blood from the "lower gastrointestinal tract", (small and large intestine), so whenever you would have bleeding in this part, the test would be positive. "FIT-DNA" or whatever other names apply, detects both blood and DNA specific for colorectal cancer.	2017-01-18 13:48:45Z	Jan
10796	10834	I also added something at the bottom of my answer above.	2017-01-18 13:52:57Z	Jan
10791	10909	1. No one psychiatrist can manage our pathology optimally. 2. Alfred Tomatis was a physician and a scientist. 3. Medical therapy (lithium etc) has almost no influence for my brother. Also we both have little influence of mood stabilizers (which usually is the basis of treatment of bipolar disorder). 4. The Tomatis method is absolutely the best treatment method for autism. 5. But our illness is not autism, and now we unfortunately really have not good treatment options	2017-01-22 19:57:25Z	
10791	10909	1. How can you be sure? 2. Right he graduated in Medicine, but he is not allowed to practice anymore since his methods are not recognized by science. 3. Sad to hear that. 4. This is absolutely not true. Please provide link to evidence. 5. Both autism and bipolar disorder have good treatment options, Tomatis method is not one of them.	2017-01-25 21:44:51Z	KingBOB
10791	10909	what can you suggest?	2017-01-25 21:54:43Z	
10791	10909	I would find a good psychiatrist.	2017-01-25 23:09:11Z	KingBOB

10788	10822	If you don't remove plaque between the teeth before using the toothbrush, the toothpaste and fluoride won't even diffuse properly between the teeth.	2017-04-30 03:12:36Z	enap_mwf
10788	10822	Actually it's known that dental plaque acts as reservoir for fluoride. See ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701197	2017-04-30 17:09:55Z	sergiouribe
10788	10822	Interesting. Thank you for the share. As per the article, fluoride can be stored in biological fluide or the enamel. I was thinking more in the sense that if we start using fluoride today (not having used it before) it would take time to diffuse through the plaque and tartar to reach the enamel on the surfaces between teeth. Likewise, it would take time to build up the reservoir in preexisting plaque, as opposed to removing it all, and if new plaque builds up, it will more readily accumulate fluoride as it's being built up.	2017-04-30 17:37:35Z	enap_mwf
10784	10879	Whether treatment needs to begin before identification depends on the patient's circumstances. That's not always true as you state.	2017-02-19 23:30:09Z	Carey Gregory
10764	10767	So did it help them fall asleep?  It appears to just help quality of sleep and duration of sleep, but I'm no expert on this.	2017-01-13 15:25:23Z	
10763	11075	Great info. I might suggest adding that generally medication classes are processed in the same way, and knowing a medication's class can help guide you.  For example, ibuprofen and naproxen are both NSAIDS, etc	2017-06-30 03:37:18Z	DoctorWhom
10759	10839	peptic ulcer, angina, carpal tunnel syndrome --> all these are treated by GPs. Usually internal medicine doctors deal with autoimmune diseases: vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, PSC etc etc, also they have more experience in treating acute conditions of cronic diseases.	2017-01-17 20:39:43Z	KingBOB
10755	10758	This is some interesting historical stuff, but you ignored modern medicine and how it deals with an extremely high temperature, which would directly answer the OP's question.	2017-01-09 23:41:44Z	Carey Gregory
10755	10758	Tell us! I'm burning up :)	2017-01-10 05:32:12Z	Metamorphic
10755	10758	It's your answer.	2017-01-10 06:02:25Z	Carey Gregory
10755	10758	Perhaps you assume that I know something more about modern medicine. There's not actually much aside from the two sentences which already exist in the answer, "I am not an expert, but I believe that Western medicine currently teaches ..." and "I have spoken with modern ER doctors ...". Whether there is more to know, I couldn't say. I wrote the answer fairly quickly, but getting that data (some years ago) took a lot of time and effort, so I hope you can appreciate it for what it is. Getting an MD to pop in and offer a competing answer should be fairly easy, since many people have that training.	2017-01-10 16:15:25Z	Metamorphic
10755	10758	Actually, getting physicians to pop in and answer isn't that easy. Although your statement about modern western medicine is somewhat true, it's definitely not true with temperatures in the 42.2C (107.9F) range. A temperature that high would be an immediate medical emergency calling for extreme measures such as ice baths. Anyway, if you can't provide more answer that's fine. What you wrote is an interesting addition. +1	2017-01-10 19:11:18Z	Carey Gregory

10748	10775	The wifi has real health risks, plenty of studies available. You can disable the service, I suggest you use plug a ethernet cable(you can buy it on ebay 300 meters too if you want and share with friends/family,but you need special crimper and the small piece at the end)	2017-08-04 00:42:07Z	HerbalResearcher
10748	10775	@HerbalResearcher Wifi does not have "real health risks." If you want to make the case that it does, provide an answer with citations for all these studies you think exist.	2017-08-31 20:08:27Z	Carey Gregory

10705	10725	Thank you very much for the help, just a couple questions: why brush only twice a day? Isn't it better to do it more frequently? Also, do you reccomend a soft toothbrush just to help with my specific situation, or do you reccomend soft toothbrushes to everybody in general?	2017-01-06 03:36:55Z	
10705	10725	The function of the toothbrush is to carry some fluoride to the surface of the teeth and charge the biofilm with it. Yes, the biofilm is a natural reservoir of fluoride. There is no need to brush more than twice a day for that. About the soft toothbrush, I reccomend in general. Again, the main function of the toothbrushing is to carry the fluoride. Here you will find more [info: knowyourteeth.com/infobites/abc/article/… the Academy of General Dentistry)	2017-01-06 05:58:16Z	sergiouribe
10705	10725	Thanks. And just one more question; the website you linked reccomends flossing, but do you reccomend flossing my special tooth as well if my only goal is to go about 5 more weeks witouth pain?	2017-01-06 11:12:43Z	
10705	10725	I recommend to floss or use gently a toothpick to remove any food.	2017-01-07 05:01:00Z	sergiouribe
10704	10710	So that bone plate needs to be replaced by man-made structure? Why can not we put it back? At least skins are on it and hairs may grow again.	2017-04-07 02:24:04Z	
10704	10710	@questionhang No, the skin and hair are retained and remain attached to the person. They aren't attached to the skull. Only the bone itself is removed, not the skin and tissue covering it. Replacing it with man-made material is easier, cheaper and safer for the patient.	2017-04-07 04:05:47Z	Carey Gregory
10704	10710	Can we put the original bone back? Is it dead after removal?	2017-04-09 12:38:59Z	
10704	10710	@questionhang It can be put back and often is. Read the "Procedure" section of the link you cited.	2017-04-09 14:59:20Z	Carey Gregory
10704	10710	@questionhang Yes.	2017-04-10 03:51:38Z	Carey Gregory
10694	10698	Interesting. I would like to know what the body is trying to achieve by sensitising itself. What benefit is supposed to arise from this, as such behavior may lead to a pain, muscle-shortening syndrome? Could it be vestigial?	2017-01-05 16:17:30Z	
10694	10698	@BrunoSchiavo, my common sense answer is that pain suggests a person to stop with damaging activities in the future. Myofascial pain probably develops as a reaction to continuous, repeating muscle overuse. Maybe it's like "muscle hangover" or "muscle migraine."	2017-01-05 16:25:57Z	Jan

10665	10689	@ASuckerinMaths, I added something to the bottom of my answer above.	2017-01-03 16:44:29Z	Jan
10665	10689	Cysteine and cystine are two distinct molecules. Did you mean USDA misspelled or incorrectly identified?	2017-01-03 22:39:12Z	Anna Zhilkova
10665	10689	@AnnaZhilkova, I think they misspelled it. It is listed under the amino acids here , and cystine is not amino acid, but an amino acid-like compound made of 2 mollecules of cysteine.	2017-01-19 21:50:45Z	Jan
10664	10688	This is simply wrong. Fats contain 37 kJ/g while carbs and proteins contain only 17. So you need to replace carbs, cereals, and those lean meats with the fattiest meats available.	2017-01-04 22:02:39Z	Carey Gregory
10664	10688	@CareyGregory, the question was "highest calorie per unit price that you can buy and eat regularly." I provided a practical answer. For 2 dollars, I can get 1 kg of bread and only 100 g of chicken and I will get more calories from that bread than from chicken. In general, carbohydrate foods have the best calorie/price value. From protein/fat foods, I found canned fish and chicken most affordable.	2017-01-05 07:58:08Z	Jan
10664	10688	You would have to show some numbers to prove it because I believe you'd still get more calories per dollar from cheap, fatty meats than from bread, chicken or fish. Consider lard, for example. Hard to beat the calories/$ with that one.	2017-01-05 14:55:42Z	Carey Gregory
10664	10688	@CareyGregory, you would eat lard regularly for few months? I have provided a short list of high-calorie foods a decent person on low budget could be actually prepared to eat regularly (as the OP asked), let's say for few months. The prices mentioned above are from the store I buy food (converted from Euros).	2017-01-05 16:12:52Z	Jan
10664	10688	Of course not, but there was a time that people used lard the way we use butter today, spreading it on other foods, cooking with it, etc, so it's certainly possible to consume a lot of it. Anyway, I'll reverse my downvote, but I'd really like to see some numbers to prove your point. (In fact, you will have to edit your question in order for me to upvote.)	2017-01-05 21:05:25Z	Carey Gregory
10664	10714	This doesn't answer the question. The question is which food has the highest calorie content, not which foods are cheap sources of protein.	2017-01-04 21:56:01Z	Carey Gregory
10664	10714	Carey Gregory, the OP asked for foods with the highest calorie count that can be eaten regularly. People may interpret "regularly" differently, as a snack or as a primary source of calories. To regularly eat something as a primary source of calories, enough of those calories must come from protein otherwise consumers will experience an "undesirable health effect due to the sole reason that they eat it regularly". For evidence I cite common knowledge and the fact that a large portion of the world uses these as their primary calorie source due to its cost-effectiveness.	2017-01-05 18:44:57Z	ancientcampus
10664	10714	You and the other answer both focused more on price than I think the question asked for, but that's a matter of interpretation. I still believe cheap, fatty meats are more calories for the money and neither you nor the other answer have shown otherwise.	2017-01-05 21:08:44Z	Carey Gregory
10664	10714	@CareyGregory It is not up the the question to dis-prove what you think is otherwise.	2017-01-28 18:43:25Z	Paparazzi

10653	10654	@Maisam Hedyelloo, no obvious answer but my guess is: the tissue that the doctor managed to get with biopsy contained "tiny fragment of connective tissue" -- which is normal tissue--, so the document does not mention any cancer or other abnormality. But it also says that the specimen was not of a good quality (it was "suboptimal") so it does not exclude cancer. Maybe a new biopsy that would provide better quality specimen would show cancer (or not). So, if the doctor will say that no cancer was found, ask him if he suggests another biopsy or other investigation.	2016-12-30 20:22:08Z	Jan
10653	10654	Yep, the report just says the sample wasn't adequate to draw any conclusions.	2016-12-31 06:16:24Z	Carey Gregory
10653	10654	@jan Thanks for your Answer	2016-12-31 06:56:16Z

10648	10655	This does not answer the question. The question is how to differentiate symptomatically between septic shock and shock due to other causes (like blood loss).	2016-12-30 18:10:46Z	
10648	10655	OK, @TylerDurden I edited my answer. I hope that helps..	2016-12-31 15:51:02Z	Lamia Kouba

10647	10649	My vision is recovered 100%	2018-01-05 21:32:45Z	
10647	10649	@user2824371 Congratulations! Was your recovery recent, of did it disappear quickly?	2018-01-08 15:49:11Z	HDE 226868
10647	10649	First, I took IV steroids (solumedrol) for five days. No improvements occurred during those 5 days. Second, I was on oral steroids for about two weeks. I recovered most of my vision during the first week (Including recovering 100% of my field of vision).	2018-01-09 15:45:50Z	
10647	10649	After recovering 100% of field of vision, I found out that the brightness was still a little bit darker or maybe it's the colors that were still a little bit faint (especially the red). I was not so sure because the symptoms were so subtle. I did a VEP test and there was a delay in the electrical signal that passes through my optic nerve. This means there was still a tiny inflammation in the optic nerve. It took about 6 months to restore the brightness/colors. Now, I see normally. It's like buying a new eye :)	2018-01-09 15:51:09Z	
10647	10649	Till now, I still have two lesions in my brain but it's okay. There are no symptoms. Thank you too much for answering my question and releasing my nervousness. I was upset then. I really appreciate that.	2018-01-09 15:55:46Z

10605	10607	But how !!, Sweat carries with it the grime of what's built up in pores and what's on face, and if it settles back into skin—no good. Breakouts, milia, rashes...the triumvirate of irritated skin	2016-12-26 04:09:25Z	
10605	10607	@DasserBasyouni The people who have reduced the number of showers they take are mostly positive about this, see e.g. this article about the experience of someone who showers once a week while doing some sink washing every day. A lot of the problems we think we're solving when scrubbing our skins with soap under the shower are actually caused by this habit in the first place. The best thing is to let the body take care of itself and only intervene in special cases (e.g. keeping a wound clean).	2016-12-26 04:55:28Z	Count Iblis
10605	10607	@DasserBasyouni Throughout much of human history many/most people very rarely bathed and some literally never did. Consider desert nomads. When would they have enough water available to bathe? And how would peoples living in arctic climates bathe when the temperatures are sub-freezing for months at a time? Those people didn't suffer more skin problems then we do, probably fewer.	2016-12-26 17:02:17Z	Carey Gregory
10591	10594	Great answer. Thanks for taking the time :)	2016-12-24 16:48:14Z	
10591	10594	Almost a great answer except it's completing lacking sources. That's a particularly glaring omission when you mention specific studies. What studies? If you know about them, why not cite them?	2016-12-24 21:58:17Z	Carey Gregory
10590	10596	That's what I thought. Very interesting thank you.	2016-12-25 02:32:01Z

10560	10900	In my case it was the desire to self-harm. I am usually a really optimistic person and have never even thought about something like that but one day it was this really strong compulsion. it freaked me out and I realized I need to be much more serious about coping with stress and not pushing myself too hard.	2017-01-22 14:42:44Z	
10544	13350	Hi, this is correct except that I'm not sure what "choose the company" means?  Yes Tadalafil = the generic (non-brand-name) version of Cialis.  Said another way, Cialis is a fancy brand name for tadalafil since they released it. It is the same medication.	2017-08-17 05:13:22Z	DoctorWhom
10544	13350	Any references?	2017-08-17 19:34:59Z	Lucky
10544	13350	Wikipedia article added as reference.	2017-08-19 13:09:13Z	Stylus
10544	13350	this doesn't address whether the generic is interchangeable with the brand name at all. The OP already knows that Tadalafil is the generic and Cialis is the brand name. That's not the question. Nor is "how can I get my doctor to prescribe me a generic" the question, though your answer of "request him to" isn't exactly groundbreaking if that was the question.	2017-08-19 16:28:44Z	Kate Gregory

10529	10547	Actually I am dad. My son is in middle school. He looks healthier than I am. I touch his body and feel his body temperature a little warmer than my hand. I have asked him if he is born like this or has developed over time. He said he has developed it. We set our room temperature as 70. I don't know what his room's temperature is but we feel every room is comfortable except his. His mom and sisters feel the same as I do. I wonder if anyone is the same as my son.	2016-12-20 14:24:40Z	
10529	10547	He looks a little bigger than his boy classmates, no sudden weight gain or loss. Before we lived in apartment in Canada the whole time where because the building has to ensure the coldest unit reach certain temperature, most of the units are very very warm. Winter's apartments in Canada, everyone wears summer clothes at home. Now we have moved to a house in the States, where we set the temperature ourselves, I then started to notice this.	2016-12-20 15:02:26Z	
10529	10534	You don't want to add drama but you raise the specters of cancer and hyperthydroidism over some kid not feeling cold and eating only his favorite foods? I think your answer is nothing but drama.	2016-12-20 01:43:43Z	Carey Gregory

10528	10537	Quote from the first article cited: "These results are provocative but inconclusive due to methodologic problems relating to the necessary use of surrogate respondents and the long time period of potential exposure for this dementing disease."

10510	10523	Please clarify that, pre-ejaculate fluid does not contain motile sperm cells, however, the urethra may contain "left-over" sperm cells from prior ejaculate. Assuming the indivdual has no conditions affecting his ability to ejaculate (such as retrogade ejaculation) all sperm is realised via, ejaculation within the semen and furtherly, when he urinates, flushing the urethra.	2016-12-20 01:32:44Z	user19679
10510	10523	Yes, that is correct. The alkaline fluid that comes out as the pre-ejaculate is made in Cowper's glands, which do not produce sperm. However, sperm may be present from a prior ejaculation and come out as part of the pre-ejaculate.	2016-12-20 01:37:19Z	OverlordvI

10489	10490	On the basis of: "This energy comes from food (especially carbohydrate and lipid or fat)" someone can think that energy does not come from proteins in the food. Proteins contain about 4 Calories per gram, like carbohydrates.	2016-12-15 07:45:08Z	Jan
10489	10490	Ok I'm replacing the "especially" with mainly. Also I've mentioned about protein burn  in another place. Thanks and feel free to any other improvement could be done, or anyother mistake stays there.	2016-12-15 07:48:03Z	Always Confused
10489	10490	Carbohydrates and proteins are pretty much "equal" source of energy. I wouldn't emphasize the small difference between them. If you eat a steak (protein + fat) or cake (sugar + fat) with same calorie value, you will get about the same amount of calories from both foods. Yes, you did mention (body) protein burning, but you kinda neglected proteins from food as a source of energy.	2016-12-15 07:50:18Z	Jan
10489	10490	but there is a priority difference of usage in body so far i knew	2016-12-15 07:52:24Z	Always Confused
10489	10490	When your start to use energy from your own body (in fasted/starvation state), it is the priority: first, carbohydrates from glycogen will be used, then fat, then protein. But when you eat food with a mixture of carbs, fats and proteins, all 3 nutrient groups will be used as an energy, or, if taken in calorie surplus, they will be converted to fat and stored as body fat. In case of foods, it does not matter what is used first. Eventually all energy from either carbs, fats or proteins will be used.	2016-12-15 08:00:35Z	Jan
10472	10481	On a personal note - I am very sorry that you had to receive such news, especially in this time of year. Still, there are several types of MS, most of them are not as severe as seen in the movies and one can lead a very normal life with some types. There are various sorts of disease-modifying therapy, which is taken regularly, even when you feel well, to improve your prognosis. The downside is that they are very expensive, but depending on the country you live in, insurance might cover it. All of this can be answered by your doctor, but while you are having problems with your vision [cont]	2016-12-14 16:18:31Z	Lucky
10472	10481	... your doctor's primary concerns is probably to mitigate that as much as possible. But I urge you to ask about diet recommendations while on glucocorticoid therapy, it might seem like going through a lot of trouble in an inconvenient part of the year, but it can be well worth it in the long run. There are always low-fat, low sugar alternatives of holiday meals that are still  delicious.	2016-12-14 16:21:26Z	Lucky

10462	10476	Do "more free time" and the disadvantage in your post contradict each other?	2016-12-14 09:57:53Z

10462	10476	How would you separate recreation and leisure? To me they're pretty much the same things.	2016-12-14 10:04:06Z	
10462	10476	Leisure is the spare or rest time in the daily life of a person when he is not occupied by work, studies, sleep etc.Recreation is indulging in thrilling and exciting activities, to derive some pleasure and have fun in one’s leisure time. Simply say, "Recreation is doing activities that recharge and freshens up in one’s leisure time".	2016-12-14 10:08:04Z	Lakshmi Balan

10457	10468	@Omu You can be allergic to pollen but not honey or bee stings. An allergy to pollen could be what is causing the burning.	2017-01-04 18:39:07Z	L.B.
10457	10468	@L.B. the more I used honey in my nose the less it hurt, so I think the burning was when the honey was touching the wound/infected area ( from the surgery done years ago maybe)	2017-01-04 19:22:11Z

10457	10715	Interesting! That is a topic I can't speak on with any authority. Sinus infections and open wounds are rather different.	2017-01-04 19:27:11Z	ancientcampus
10457	10715	Honey is naturally antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal when used for healing purposes. That along with the fact that it is sticky means that a wound covered in honey can not only heal quicker but the honey can prevent infection in a wound.	2017-11-06 02:44:19Z	Caters

10390	10393	The PubMed link actually seems to say there is NO effect of ALA on prostate cancer. I was aware of prostate cancer uncertainty in relation to omega-3, but didn't know it was specific to ALA, so this is interesting.	2016-12-08 10:20:31Z	
10390	10393	NutrientsReview is interesting too, besides the mentioned downsides it says some, but not all, studies have shown that a diet high in ALA might be heart-protective for those who rarely eat fish, so fish is preferable (but ALA may be an alternative for vegetarians or people who dislike fish). But indeed, a gram of flax seed omega-3 is not equal to a gram of EPA/DHA supplement.	2016-12-08 10:23:48Z	
10390	10393	@Mark, correct, in the PubMed article, there is no association with prostate cancer; I edited. ALA supplements or flaxseed seem to be very poor source of omega-3, not because of the amount of ALA, but because of poor conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA . OK, claims about ALA are not conclusive. Search: flaxseed + desired effect + "systematic review". I was researching this and found no convincing benefits of flaxseed except laxative effects. Properly designed vegetarian diet without fish and omega-3 supplements can be just fine and some studies say it can be even better than a mixed diet.	2016-12-08 12:28:57Z	Jan

10326	10329	Except you are not aware of the missing field... it's not black, it just isn't there.	2016-12-03 05:22:33Z	Jim Garrison
10316	12862	All nice to know, but it doesn't answer the question (ie, gender differences).	2017-07-07 04:15:53Z	Carey Gregory
10311	10400	Terry, note that the OP specifically mentions heart beat rate, anxiousness and other symptoms of high adrenaline, not just brain fog, so your suggestion about gluten may be misleading. I'm not aware of the association between gluten and the symptoms that the OP has listed.	2016-12-08 13:07:10Z	Jan
10311	10400	In the book Grain Brain, Dr. Perlmutter mentions anxiety, depression, brain fog, migraines/headaches, and sleepiness/tiredness among others.  I should have probably mentioned all of those in my response, though I did mention anxiety and depression in my answer.	2016-12-08 22:19:08Z	Terry Palmer
10277	10280	I love this answer, it's very informative. Personally, I think this question is already answered	2016-11-28 08:26:58Z	Prince
10277	10280	@Prince I agree with you, the answer is very comprehensive and informative.	2016-11-29 22:26:20Z	
10270	10273	Most of what I found online is basically what you're saying: a mask can sometimes be effective at preventing the spread of disease (whether worn by a sick person or otherwise).  What I'm asking is not about transmission, but whether an already-sick person can him/herself benefit from the use of a mask to fight off the infection (especially a virus) since a mask provides humidity and warmth.	2016-11-29 02:56:39Z	
10270	10273	Okay, I'll see what I can do about that	2016-11-29 06:17:49Z	Prince
10270	10273	Hopefully that answer will satisfy your question	2016-11-29 06:35:30Z	Prince
10270	10273	So what's your basis for saying a mask cannot help fight an infection?  If steam inhalation (whether from boiling water or a shower) or even a humidifier (especially warm air humidifier) can help, why would a mask not help?  A mask provides warm, moist air all day long.  It's not that I have made up my mind and am looking for confirmation; I'm just trying to understand what you're basing your statement on and if there are any studies that support it.  Thanks!	2016-11-30 17:58:41Z	
10270	10273	Well, from all I've gathered, a mask was originally designed to protect against infection. I understand that mask could also serve as an humidifier and in the case of sinusitis, that could help. But some people react with what the mask is made of, so it's not all that advisable to use mask when having sinusitis, if you are not sure whether your sinuses would react with it or not	2016-11-30 20:27:51Z	Prince
10260	10275	Is there a possibility that even if the acid does not come into the mouth in the liquid form, the vapors or fumes would have the ability to trigger the aphthous stomatitis or mouth ulcers because I have observed that when I take ppi the sores go away. Would a prokinetic agent solve the sphincter problem?	2016-11-28 17:18:03Z	
10260	10275	There are cases of silent reflux that cause mouth ulcers. If using PPI's helps your mouth ulcers then this is certainly a possibility. This is dangerous as chronic reflux can lead to chest infections and oesophageal cancer. I suggest you get it checked out.	2016-11-28 19:27:04Z	Dr Xorile
10260	10275	This has the makings of a good answer, but we require all answers on Health SE to be referenced.  Please see this meta post for additional details.	2016-12-02 19:57:47Z	Atl LED
10255	10256	Your first sentence is the answer. What he describes doesn't sound like floaters.	2016-11-25 17:59:42Z	Carey Gregory
10255	10256	Indeed. However, when I press my eyeball firmly, the vision doesn't become unclear; it turns totally dark, making me think of occluding either the optic nerve, or either the ophthalmic artery, in which latter case it would mean that the receptors (cones & rods) are extremely oxygen dependent and sensitive. Should look this up; whether it is the CN II or the A. ophtalmica you compress while doing that ... That aside; I hope you get better soon!	2016-11-27 15:12:03Z	FSJ963
10253	10504	That's a nice graphic but you didn't answer the question.	2016-12-17 04:52:58Z	Carey Gregory
10248	13555	I'm going to phone a friend to fill in if I missed something, @CareyGregory since your background is in emergency medicine - can EMTs deliver meds (beyond like an EpiPen)?  I do know they can draw labs and place IVs, but unsure about administration of meds or vaccines.	2017-09-08 04:56:01Z	DoctorWhom
10241	10245	I also wash dishes regularly, so I get the point, yes. But I do think that hot water (50-60°C) helps with washing dishes only to the extent that it helps dissolving/melting certain types of leftover substances so they wash off easier. It's easy to think then that skin oils would wash off similarly easier due to warmer water temperature but as far as I know our skin oils are already in a liquid state, so they wouldn't get any "more liquid" when in contact with hot water. So if that really was the case I would really like to see your source.	2016-11-25 13:25:27Z	
10236	10238	Hmm this answer, though it provides a lot of potentially useful information, it doesn't seem to have sources from scholarly articles, which would bolster their credibility. Additionally, the main focus of the question was on thirst, not health benefits. Saying "yes it does" without any supporting evidence is insufficient.	2016-11-27 22:11:08Z	Dave Liu
10230	10234	Hi, believe it or not I am sensitive to all of your food list except things like leafy greens e.g kale and fish.  however greens do not have enough calcium to make your recommended intake without eating many bags a day - impractical.  i know there are scientific studies which say fish bones have at least as good calcium bioavailability as milk.  You did not answer the main component of my question, which was about the safety(to digestive system) of eating fish bones which had been poached and cut down in size.  Thanks.	2016-11-24 01:46:20Z	
10230	10234	@JamesWilson  I'm an MD, I've had a longtime practice and I'm careful about my comments.  As I said before, medicine doesn't work like that.  The fact that there is a lot of calcium in fish bones doesn't mean they are suitable for oral ingestion.  Chalk has a lot of calcium too, and so do many other compounds.  In the 21st century, every self-respecting physician practices what we call evidence based medicine.  We can only say something about efficacy and safety if there are specific studies about those aspects in humans.	2016-11-24 16:22:07Z	Centaurus
10230	10234	We can only recommend homemade ground fish bones as a substitute for calcium in the US, if it has been approved by the FDA.  I don't know which country you live in but in most countries of the world a doctor can be sued for prescribing something that has not been approved by regulatory agencies.  Your health is a serious subject and it's very dangerous to follow instructions offered by the layman.  The Internet, and even newspapers and magazines, are often publishing some sensationalistic material about miraculous drugs and foods.	2016-11-24 16:29:01Z	Centaurus
10230	10234	In my answer I've given you what I think is the best advice: visit your doctor and find out whether you have calcium deficiency.  That's the first step.  If you do, he will tell you the best food or the best pharmaceutical preparation to bring calcium up to normal levels.  This may not be what you wanted to hear, but it's serious professional advice. Don't put your health and your safety at risk.	2016-11-24 16:34:25Z	Centaurus
10225	10228	You need to consume as much water as you lose it from your body (mainly by urinating and sweating). If you lose 2 liters you need to replace 2 liters and if you lose 6 liters (e.g. when working in a hot environment), you need to replace 6 liters. So, the recommendation about 0.5-1 ounce per pound of body weight is misleading.	2017-01-20 08:35:15Z	Jan
10221	10222	Thanks for the suggestions and information. For #1, rubbing your eyes really can damages them?	2016-12-19 02:07:36Z	
10221	10222	I'm convinced rubbing your eyes will reshape the lens (cornea) because I found a while ago if I temporarily made the lens more round (concave) by slightly pushing inward on the eyelid (see picture), the slight blur in my right eye goes away. The improvement is most noticeable when looking at a bright spot against a dark background like a traffic light. Since I did have a habbit of rubbing my right eye, I conclude that probably flattened the cornea a bit. But you don't have to take my word. Lots of other sources say not to rub.	2016-12-29 05:47:49Z	Yale Zhang
10221	10222	Okay. Thanks for heads up.	2016-12-30 20:41:40Z	
10217	15464	Welcome to Health, many may! Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, we require answers that are backed up with reliable references. Please take the tour read the help center, maybe visit some pages from our Health Meta, like this.	2018-02-28 14:45:27Z	LangLangC
10207	10208	All of these are long-term methods, at least relative to laughter that jumps from zero to sixty and back within a nominal ten seconds.

10194	10195	You need more than a vegan recipe site to support your claim that eating more beans decreases digestion time.	2016-11-20 16:31:32Z	Carey Gregory
10194	10195	I agree. This claim should be backed with more solid information. 28 years eating legumes very regularly make it hard to believe that your digerstive tract gets used to it. Mine hasn't, you just live with it.	2016-11-21 09:11:07Z	Variax
10187	10205	I don't think your information is accurate. As of November 2016 poultry farmers routinely and systematically feed their birds with Roxarsone and that includes both chickens and turkeys. In fact, you can buy roxarsone right here on this website (it is sold under the trade name "Super Nitro"): domvet.com/supernitro.html (notice the poison warnings)	2016-11-21 09:23:26Z	
10187	10205	That link you posted takes you to a Canadian provider. Canada is not under the FDA jurisdiction, and I've found conflicting information about the use of roxarsone there. Some sites say it is discontinued (theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/…), while others list it as availabre for purchase (pharmacompass.com/health-canada-drug-product-database/roxarsone). I'm pretty sure importing banned substances from Canada into the US is illegal and can get you in trouble if caught feeding them to your poultry.	2016-11-21 10:21:46Z	Variax
10164	10167	Since the OP asked about the FDA, it seems safe to assume the question is specific to the US, so Chinese regulations don't answer the question.	2017-03-18 16:56:33Z	Carey Gregory
10164	10167	@CareyGregory Since many cosmetic brands sell their products all over the world, learning how certain cosmetics are regulated outside the US might help the OP.	2017-03-21 07:22:42Z	Marzipanherz
10154	10157	That's a decent answer, and I stumbled upon the same webpage myself, but I am looking for the answer to this - Does ethanol enter the bloodstream at a slower rate the more you drink?	2016-11-16 22:55:18Z	
10154	10157	I'll edit my answer once I've gotten a suitable answer to your question.	2016-11-16 23:31:08Z	Prince
10154	10157	I just realized that my answer still contributes to your question. There's not much difference between alcohol and ethanol. So there's no need for me to edit my answer.	2016-11-16 23:35:41Z	Prince
10154	10157	Okay, I'll phase my question in another way - Does your body have a mechanism in place that will slow the absorption of alcohol (ethanol) in your bloodstream once your BAC has reached a certain limit? Do blood cells 'understand' when they have been saturated with too much ethanol and begin to actively reject the ethanol into the bloodstream?	2016-11-17 18:17:12Z	
10153	10160	I've done several research on your last question, if taller people tend to be more claustrophobic than shorter one, but couldn't find a reasonable  and presentable answer	2016-11-16 23:21:45Z	Prince
10153	10160	She asked a three-part question and you answered one part (partially - there's a lot more to phobias than that). Adding "I don't know" in the comments doesn't help your answer much. I'm not trying to pick on you but you keep answering questions in a hurry without spending the time needed to make it a good answer. You'd get a lot more positive rep from a few good answers that a lot of mediocre ones.	2016-12-17 05:20:29Z	Carey Gregory

10102	10105	Thank you for answering it! I wasn't quite sure if it would be considered a "health" question or more of a cultural question, but I thought I remembered psychoanalysts like Freud theorizing about deja vu. It's interesting that it's still an ongoing quest. Yes, I found your answer very interesting. So sometimes these could be false-memories? Neuroscience is quite complex!

10093	10097	@vidstige  The EKG is inevitably abnormal although the abnormalities observed (sinus tachycardia, ST-T wave changes, atrial flutter, premature beats, heart block, bundle branch block, etc)  are not specific for myocarditis and can be seen in other disorders.

10079	10082	@Prince  Before criticizing the absence of references in my answer you should provide a real reference to back up your answer that a hematologist is the specialist a patient with low sodium levels should look for.  Your link takes us to a page on multiple myeloma instead.	2016-11-13 22:23:17Z	Centaurus
10079	10082	From my research, your advice on the use of not going to a hematologist was inadequate, from rightdiagnosis.com/h/hyponatremia/doctors.htm, you'll see that a hematologist is actually one of the specialist that can help treat low sodium levels. So it would be wise of you to edit your answer.	2016-11-14 08:43:28Z	Prince
10079	10082	+1 for the right answer Centaurus (and I know what I am talking about as I am in the medical field). Cheers!	2016-11-14 12:01:15Z	Felipe
10079	10080	I am downvoting this answer as by no mean, a hematologist is the specialist  for hyponatremia. From my current experience (I am a medical student currently working at an internal medicine department), hyponatremia can be addressed by a specialist in internal medicine and or nephrologist and or endocrinologist. So Centaurus' answer below is definitely the right one! I can't understand how your answer got upvoted tbh. It's totally misleading...	2016-11-14 11:59:44Z	Felipe

10040	11181	Touche. Thank you. Barbiturate use in my country is extremely low, street or prescription, so it's very seldom discussed or comes to mind. You are quite correct. The only two I have ever suffered are alcohol and diazepam. The latter with a sudden stop after 30mg a day for about a year, and all I felt was extreme anxiety and slight flu like symptoms. I'm certain that barbs would in fact be worse; closer to alcohol, although they pharmacokinetics are quite different.	2017-02-15 02:21:47Z	ProfK
10040	11143	This is incorrect, or at least incomplete. Alcohol and opiates are not the only drug withdrawals that can be lethal. In fact, you left out the most dangerous one of all.	2017-02-14 00:56:07Z	Carey Gregory

10037	10039	It would be pretty difficult to conduct the repeated physical activity necessary to maintain breathing in a t-float while in a stupor. I was there; I fell asleep. Besides, a build up of CO2 in the lungs activates the asphyxiation reflex. That didn't happen.	2016-11-11 06:16:23Z	BillDOe
10037	10039	I didn't say you were in a stupor while mantaining physical activity.   Your abnormal breathing pattern increased PaCO2 (arterial CO2 concentration) and you eventually got into a stupor. That's when someone had to "wake you up".   You think you fell asleep.  You are entitled to think whatever you like but I doubt a scientist would call it "falling asleep".	2016-11-11 15:09:25Z	Centaurus
10037	10039	I don't mean to say it's impossible to fall asleep during physical activity.  In the medical science very few things can be classified as impossible.  However, it's just the there is not a single case described in the medical literature.	2016-11-11 15:16:16Z	Centaurus
10037	10039	I don't really want to get into a drawn out argument as to whether or not I actually fell asleep on that occasion many years ago. From what I was told I had to be awaken after I didn't get out of the pool after the order to do so was given. I was still continuing the motions involved in the t-float and had been asleep for at least 15 minutes. That would be a very long time to continue motion while in a stupor. And at no time was I gasping for air. I was also told that this was rather rare, though not unheard of.	2016-11-11 20:43:42Z	BillDOe

10026	10032	Shower water temperature varies from place to place. So does one's criterion of what is a "cold shower".  In addition, there is no evidence in the medical literature that so-called "cold showers" prevent the development of hypertension, either in those people who got that genetic inheritance or in those who are going to develop secondary hypertension.  The same goes for depressive disorder, brain function, etc.   I've read the site your answer mentions and it is all bullshit, probably written by a quack or someone who just wants to get public attention.	2016-11-10 22:55:39Z	Centaurus

10020	10035	@Centaurus I thought my previous comment explained my down vote. The question is asking for an accelerated curriculum to become a doctor. Your answer neither explains why an accelerated program is not possible or provides a template for an accelerated program. This lack of an answer coupled with claims about health professionals that are generally not true (e.g., a DO can perform surgery in the US) is why I down voted your answer.	2017-04-10 19:05:58Z	StrongBad
10020	10035	@StrongBad   The question mentions "a third world country with a lack of medical practitioners".  There is no specific textbook here.  Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine?   Certainly not.  I just suggested a qualified physician write a specific textbook focusing on the 90% more common disorders in that area and train their health professionals on diagnosis and treatment.	2017-04-10 23:12:18Z	Centaurus

10009	10018	The issue is more complicated because of the amblyopia. By patching the "good" eye, the decrease in vision is much more like covering both eyes. The reliance on depth cues is likely decreased, however, because of the amblyopia. Therefore, covering both of your eyes is not the same as patching an eye for amblyopia.	2017-04-10 15:23:00Z	StrongBad

9967	10005	So are you saying that the concept of a first infection in an outbreak was used by medical practitioners, but it just went by a different name ("index case" instead of "patient zero")? The CNN article you've referenced mentions the press's confusion about the term "patient zero", but does not clarify whether they misread a typo because it looked like an existing concept, or whether they made up the concept entirely.	2016-12-04 02:53:22Z

9959	13892	@LangLangC: Maybe I should have put it as the simplest way to supplement alkaline food? Dissolving NaHCO3 in water has a pH of ~9 depending on the concentration/water. I assume researchers prefer sodium bicarbonate over more complex alkaline foods because the supplementation is more straightforward and controllable.	2017-10-07 15:32:58Z	bluenote10
9959	13896	This is a probably excellent comment, alas, posted as an answer, lacking references. This violates policy. If you want to answer the question, please do so, looks as if you have all the knowledge and tools to do it. I am looking forward to it.	2017-10-07 20:32:23Z	LangLangC
9959	13896	Could you please clarify your first point? The blood pH was elevated even before the exercise, i.e., just 90 minutes after supplementing with bicarb. It is not clear to me why the intensity of the exercise matters. On your second point: Note that downing 500 ml of a pH ~9 food already is an extreme case (trying to go more alkaline will just give you the runs, I remember seeing studies specifically on this) and yet the blood pH only reacts by a tiny 0.05. So I agree that the system "withstands the extremes of external environment", but there is clear evidence that it is not entirely unaffected.	2017-10-07 20:52:37Z	bluenote10
9959	13896	Intensity of exercise matters very much, because it causes lactacidosis, it´s why people thought adding alkaline foods would help in the first place. And yes, the pH was elevated immediately after bicarb, but you´ll notice it stayed within the normal range. Why? Because the body wants it there and is working very hard to maintain it there. And yet... exercise sent both groups deep into acidosis, in spite of extreme alkaline administration. Lesson? You can´t really supplement your way into pH regulation, the system is just not sensitive enough to what you can reasonably ingest.	2017-11-25 11:57:33Z	mismas
9959	13896	As for clear evidence that the system is not unaffected... actually no. For one thing, these graphs lack assessment of statistical significance. And even if you proved statistical significance, it still doesn´t prove real life relevance. And even if we agreed that there is a relevant difference in pH of 7.39 and 7.42, there´s still the fact that these measurements were taken after 90 minutes. What about after 6 or 12 hours, which is a much more relevant time frame for elimination of bicarb?	2017-11-25 12:02:05Z	mismas
9959	13896	Back to the original question: no, there is no need to regulate systemic pH with food. It´s already regulated, and if not, you´re among the most critically ill people, and supplements won´t save you, nor are you able to consider them. Furthermore, your body is made so that even extreme ingestion of alkaline food (as above) will have only a transient negligible effect on your systemic pH, because to have it any other way could be deadly whenever you strayed from your diet. And if extreme supplementation only causes a transient glitch in pH, how would one actually regulate it with supplements?	2017-11-25 12:13:04Z	mismas

9893	9895	"Universal childhood virus" is not the name of a virus (at least not in the professional or medical field (zero hits for the quoted phrase in pubmed), just the headline of that article. I really think you need to change your first sentence so that's clear.  HHV-6 is thought to have infected 60-80% of babies by 18 months, and can from the DNA, but the rate of infection from the outside is higher. New Scientist wasn't clear that the majority of congenital infections were from DNA, not the majority of HHV-6 infections. I also added the quotes.	2016-12-03 03:12:02Z	Atl LED
9893	9895	I would have also changed the first sentence, but I think doing so would change the meaning of the post, so I leave it to you to change.  My suggestion would be "HHV-6 can be passed through verticle transmission in about 1% of births in the US.  Most (~86% of the 1%) of these cases originate from germ line transmission of the virus.	2016-12-03 03:20:17Z	Atl LED

9719	9728	Anko this is fascinating stuff, thank you very much for the detailed reply.  Now I have one more question which may or may not be something you can answer, but the question is if I find a bad bunch of whatever dried fruit, should I just go with a different brand?  Or could this happen to any brand, given that they presumably work with many growers and they can make mistakes?  I'm perplexed because of the negative reviews there and yet Costco carrying these and Amazon too and elsewhere this brand also getting positive reviews, something doesn't add up.	2016-10-23 22:50:32Z	
9719	9728	@MichaelFard I agree it's hard to say whether it's a bad batch from an otherwise reputable supplier, or whether they have a deeper problem. Personally, I don't give online reviews much weight, and would try the product myself if they seem to be the best option otherwise, as long as I have a way to return them if there's a problem. Other options include writing to the producer, writing to your country's food safety authority, or just avoiding anything with a significant proportion of negative reviews.

9678	9679	I would think that the term nonionizing is, to the general population, not especially informative. Wouldn't specifying that the method does not use electromagnetic radiation (or just radiation if you prefer) be more helpful?	2016-10-21 15:04:29Z	
9678	9679	Calling it "electromagnetic radiation" only trades one redundant explanation for another. If you can't trust the "general population" to understand "nonionizing", what chance do they have at "EM radiation"? At some point you have to trust your listener to ask additional questions themselves, or risk becoming an excessively elucidating physics professor.	2016-10-21 16:48:40Z	Anko

Due to that, I am convinced that avoiding exercise would be a mistake and will definetely not help against that asthma. Even the seasonal asthma, which I had/have as well, got away. I used to have problems with breathing in spring for example, because I am allergic to some pollen. Today, it is just my nose and eyes that might itch - but I don't have the asthma anymore (it still occurs sometimes, but only if it hits me really bad). So yes, you can grow out of it, too.	2016-10-20 04:22:38Z	Harmless Psycho

9654	11657	The chamber receiving a diastolic volume load will dilate. Under normal circumstances, early in the course of exposrue to a VSD, this is the left ventricle.	2017-12-07 05:50:28Z	Todd
9654	9685	Spelling out your acronyms on first use and a reference would make this a much better answer.	2016-10-20 03:50:42Z	Carey Gregory

9654	9685	This answer contains many falsities. In a VSD, the shunt can be either Left to Right or Right to Left. The determinate of directionality is the pressure differential between the Left Ventricle and Right Differential- not the atria as suggested in @JohnDoe 's answer. In most early cases, the systemic pressure is higher than the pulmonary pressure and the shunt is left to right during systole. During diastole, pressure in the LV is usually higher than the RV resulting in a diastolic shunt from left to right. The net result is a predominant Left to Right shunt with LV volume overload.	2017-12-07 05:49:01Z	Todd

9628	12639	So basically, we know if it's a foreign body as soon as we have an infection or perforation?	2017-08-13 06:24:31Z	Narusan-in-coma
9628	12639	That's a possibility, yes.  My point is that it's not something to blow off.  It's usually just an abrasion that you just keep feeling, but as the EM website explains, take it seriously so if the body is actually there it doesn't lead to perf or infection. In the ER the doc can get a good history, exam, XRay, and even scope the esophagus or other testing.  On your own it's hard to tell.  Then if it's not just an abrasion, they can do something about it. If it's an abrasion, at least you've got the reassurance of knowing.	2017-08-13 07:00:45Z	DoctorWhom
9622	9623	Diagnosing a cluster headache without exam, medical history, and a bunch of other information is very dangerous.  Maybe the question was different when you originally answered it.  But if he had cellulitis or glaucoma or another medical emergency, a narrow answer could have left him thinking he didn't need to be evaluated, and if it were a condition needing immediate therapy, he could have lost an eyeball or worse.  Although your information on cluster headaches is accurate, this is an example of why medical advice questions are strictly off topic.	2017-07-19 07:07:44Z	DoctorWhom

9603	10067	For the first paragraph, a picture of the different splints would suffice. For the second part, you definitely need to back up your claim that it is caused by stress. All abstracts of studies are available for free and the findings of a study are usually included in the abstract. It is enough to link the abstract of an article!	2017-04-13 15:28:06Z	Narusan-in-coma
9598	9604	thanks, guess I will ask an doctor to take an blood sample and check out if anything is missing.	2016-10-18 22:18:00Z	
9585	9595	Thank you - this does clear up a lot. Just one final thing - if using a NSAID, when to choose aspirin over ibuprofen? Based on the articles you linked, I got the idea paracetamol should be preferred, unless treating a fever or swelling (inflammation), but am still unsure how to decide whether to take aspirin or ibuprofen.	2016-10-13 21:49:39Z	
9585	9595	Ibuprofen is better than aspirin depending on the type of pain the person is experiencing, it is slightly stronger to treat pain from soft tissue injuries and dental pain. In addition, it has been shown to be the most effective pain reliever for menstrual pains.  goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/aspirin-vs-ibuprofen	2016-10-14 08:35:39Z	Prince
9575	10405	From what I've read, I got the impression that blood sugar spikes are one of the more dangerous parts about sugar. So I would think glycemic index (GI) is important (and a reason why fruits are healthier than candy). Do you think that's worth including?	2016-12-08 11:20:03Z	Mark

9575	9576	If you wish to use the fallacy in your argument you should back it up with some evidence (from pubmed or similar). Saying that diabeties is a direct result of processed sugar is not true either. Type 1 has nothing to do with it.	2016-11-15 16:00:10Z	JJosaur
9572	9681	Thanks a lot! Still seems problematic to me. If a European pharmacy labels a drug product according to the EU guidelines and sells it in another country, it should be fine. But if that product than enters a third party country, there seems to be no guarantee that the labeling is sufficient for that country.	2016-10-21 15:32:01Z	
9572	9681	@jack Labeling is usually done for each country the medicine should be marketed in. After all, the patients should be able to understand the label - if you label a medicine in, say, German and try to market it in France that would not be good. Regulatory agencies in each country actually have requirements for labeling before they issue a marketing authorisation.	2016-10-21 15:36:56Z	Lucky
9572	9681	There are pharmacies who sell their medicine to cargo ships, so the medicine enters different countries on a regular basis. Some countries' authorities are very particular about drug labeling (Nigera seems to be a pain-in-the-ass on that for some reason). And because a pharmacy cannot know in which countries a client's cargo ship is going to travel, it is virtually impossible to meet every countries labeling standards.	2016-10-24 16:37:24Z

9494	9512	Like I said, I wandered about the potential danger of having someone manipulate my neck... But what if it's the part right between your two shoulders? Is that included in the "never ... allow ... manipulation of the neck"? With my cousin having successfully gotten his neck taken care of by the chiropractor I would be visiting, I'm wandering if I should really be that concerned... What should be done if you don't go to a chiropractor ... ?	2016-10-06 00:26:19Z	
9494	9512	@JefréN. Yes, you should  be concerned. Yes, Bill Oertell is right. No, a chiro should not be your first thought no matter what your cousin said. Good grief.	2016-10-06 04:13:16Z	Carey Gregory
9494	9512	If we are talking here about evidence-based, empirical medicine, then chiropractors should be avoided...period. They do not practice medicine, despite the claims they make. If we are talking about quackery, then maybe the SE mods can create a community for it.	2016-10-06 18:51:02Z	BillDOe
9494	9512	@JefréN., the vertebrae between the shoulder blades are the thoracic vertebrae, which are part of ,well..., your thorax. The cervical vertebrae, numbered from top to bottom, are C1 - C7 and comprise the neck. C7 sits on top of T1, and T1 is attached to the skull. The thoracic vertebrae have ribs attached to them.

9495	9496	Anecdotally, there are a lot of "sue" stories surrounding broken ribs during CPR. I would hope all such cases are dismissed. The issue with this answer is the same as in the question -this is a bad format for this sort of advice. We deviate too far from objectivity and practical demonstration. For example, what constitutes being "too weak" for CPR? Is the risk different if performing it on a child? How much force is too much for a foot? Health SE is a much better fit.	2016-10-05 04:48:36Z

9477	9478	@AB, yes, but before that it can be a nutritionist. And before that you can try some elimination diets to see, if is is any nutrient that makes you bloated: the main ones are lactose and fructose. You can try a low-FODMAP diet first.	2016-10-31 21:57:12Z	Jan
9455	9456	There is loads of evidence that lifting weights and eating enough protein to support it leads to a net gain of muscle mass. Can you add some of this evidence to your answer?	2016-10-03 08:59:35Z	JJosaur
9430	9442	+1 This is the correct answer; carb reduction helps people get dietary satiety and eat net-less calories. Eating sweets doesn't make you feel full.	2016-10-03 08:53:44Z	JJosaur
9430	9442	Just to be clear: I am not suggesting a low-carb diet here, but replacing quick carbs (no fiber) with slow carbs (with fiber).	2016-10-03 09:14:32Z	Jan

9405	9416	This is a great recipe for a completely unworkable diet of the kind I've tried over and over in my life, and failed, over and over. If it worked for you, good for you; bad for me.  I'm trying to make a reasonable, workable change that I can actually stick to. Telling me I'm not going far enough is a great way to tell me not to bother, there's no point if you don't go cold turkey - and since, as mentioned above, I've tried cold turkey a dozen times and failed, that's not much help.	2016-09-29 16:27:53Z	
9405	9414	Can you explain how you converted from 495ml 7up a day equals 17lbs body-fat per year?	2016-09-29 12:32:53Z	JJosaur
9405	9414	I was slightly off (I first used 9 kcal / g of bodyfat and 1 kg = 2 pounds, that underestimates things quite a bit). Now added the calculation.	2016-09-29 15:26:34Z	VonBeche
9405	9410	Unfortunately diet doesn't work for me (allergy to aspartame). What I'm trying to figure out is what does "in moderation" actually mean in this case? I know that everyone's calorie needs are different, etc...I know all this. I'm trying to get a guideline idea of what I should be aiming for.	2016-09-29 12:11:39Z	
9405	9410	Look at moderation this way: If I know i'm correctly hitting my macro-nutrients for the day (protein/fats/carbs) and have a few calories to spare then I can have a fizzy drink or two. I started religiously counting calories because I was only weightlifting but now I do cardio as well and understand the calorie content as well as my calorie needs I can adapt my diet depending. Its not a case of "going on a diet" its a lifestyle and mentality change. Moderation for me is once or twice a week for fizzy drinks, I use them for a energy boost.	2016-09-29 12:18:28Z	JJosaur
9405	9410	You need to look at your need for fizzy drinks from a purely mental standpoint and if they are a problem then deal with the behaviours that lead to drinking them. Stop buying multipacks, always have a bottle of water with you, never reward yourself for something good with one, etc.	2016-09-29 12:20:16Z	JJosaur

9360	9373	For which exact chelators and which exact drugs you have found some reliable evidence that they eliminate heavy metals from the body once they are already absorbed?	2016-09-26 10:07:58Z	Jan
9360	9373	Penicilamine for copper(molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/5/2/200.long) and deferasirox for iron (link.springer.com/article/10.2165%2F00003495-200767150-00007)	2016-09-26 11:34:18Z	Variax
9360	9373	OK, so, I believe that by not mentioning these chelators in your main answer you suggest (at least I do) they should not really be used by anyone who does not have clearly diagnosed heavy metal overload.	2016-09-26 11:49:31Z	Jan
9360	9373	That's right. Chelators can clear you body of heavy metals, but also of beneficial ions such as calcium or magnesium. This may cause a lot of side effects, from osteoporosis to cardiac arrest. You don't want people self-medicating with these.	2016-09-26 13:00:59Z	Variax

9355	9357	Benjamin A. Interesting answer. Thank you. However, I think the OP wants to know whether he is at higher risk of having an infection in the acute phase following the vaccination (not in the long term). @user515655 am I right?	2016-09-25 10:31:13Z	S.Victor
9355	9357	Thanks @S.Victor for the input. Actually, I thought that my post answers the question in the title Is it possible to get a secondary infection following a flu shot (I suppose secondary infection means secondary flu like infection) and the second question Can a flu shot entail a risk of secondary infection like a real flu?, don't you think? But I am fully open and ready to (try) to improve the post if further clarifications can be made... TIA	2016-09-25 10:41:14Z	Benjamin A.
9355	9357	@S.Victor Correct - secondary infection as in the first event having some causal connection to the probability of another infection - likely opportunist such as bacterial - as opposed to a concurrent infection, which would have no causal link to the original event.	2016-09-25 10:48:39Z

9344	9385	I received two down votes for this answer. I would like to know why this answer is "appropriate". This answer was meant to start a discussion, as people live in different countries and have different health care systems.   I live in Taiwan, which has a national healthcare system and although not completely "free", is subsidized compared to the health care system in the US. Patients can visit a teaching hospital, community hospital, as well as small clinics, but the doctor you would want to see should be specialized in General Surgery. In general surgery, there are other sub-specialties.	2016-09-28 05:20:10Z	辛祐賦 hsinyofu
9344	9385	Sub-specialties include hepato (liver), cardiothoracic (heart/lung), colorectal (gastrointestine related). The best physician would be one who is specialized in general surgery, and sub-specialized in colorectal procedures.	2016-09-28 05:24:15Z	辛祐賦 hsinyofu

9296	9482	I strongly disagree in your statement that there are very few men who had sex before and after circumcision. There were lots and lots of ethnic jews who were migrating from xUSSR to Israel and other jewish communities over many years.

There unresearched study group is out there, waiting to be studied.	2016-10-04 19:48:19Z	user2361
9296	9482	@user2361 Okay, maybe a group does exist, but to my knowledge no one has bothered rounding them up and asking that question. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it to happen either since it's not a vital health issue to anyone. It would also be difficult to design a study that was more than just an opinion poll.

9292	9295	Thanks for your answer, could you please add some references to back up your claims?	2016-09-19 15:39:14Z	JJosaur
9275	9278	Interesting answer. Thank you. Could you add some references for your first part? And maybe also add the reference (Textbook of Medical Physiology - Guyton and Hall) provided by the author of the answer you are linking to. Tbh, I am not sure your question is really "original" as it basically links to a similar question (and answer) of another Q/A website... Cheers! Felipe!	2016-09-17 12:47:16Z	Felipe
9275	9278	@Felipe My first part is just a more plain-language summary of the quoted part. I believe that, in principle, the answer is correct, but someone could argue about the exact resulting extent of negative water balance. Again, I searched for other online references and I didn't find them. Pointing to offline physiology books here makes no sense for me since it's not practical for readers to check them.	2016-09-17 13:40:20Z	Jan
9275	9278	_I believe that, in principle, the answer is correct, but someone could argue about the exact resulting extent of negative water balance. _ So why are you linking your answer to this 3rd party site answer although you are not convinced of it? And I still think you should mention the source the author of the "original" answer. Someone might ask, where do those number come from? There a many review on the topic, so you should be able to find one. As you suggested you are a MD, I think you should keep the standard of your answer on health SE with the same standards you apply for your work. -1	2016-09-17 14:54:53Z	Felipe
9275	9278	I found an explanation from the Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology.	2016-09-17 17:22:48Z	Jan
9275	9278	Ok thanks. Your answer looks much better now. +1 Cheers	2016-09-20 17:44:11Z	Felipe
9274	9277	Wow! Thank you for such a very thorough answer with a a helpful image to boot! This helps me understand the dangers of UV rays a whole lot more. Thanks.	2016-09-18 01:53:20Z	
9268	9269	I forgot to clarify in the question that I already know that prednisolone had tumor-inhibiting properties. My question was mainly about whether cessation of prednisolone causes the tumor to suddenly grow faster than it would have if prednisolone was never part of the equation. My vet wasn't sure. Thanks for your detailed response, however.	2016-09-16 20:13:23Z	
9268	9269	@user45623. Ok. I have edited my answer. Hope this helps. Best regards. M Arrowsmith	2016-09-16 20:54:42Z	M. Arrowsmith
9268	9269	Certainly enough for me, thanks. The first biopsy revealed the tumor was cancerous but was inconclusive as to the type (though it wasn't located near the chest and certainly wasn't mammary). I think the vet said that the cancer might be lymphatic in nature; we're waiting on a biopsy of the full tumor.	2016-09-16 21:27:09Z	
9268	9269	Thanks for updating me @user45623. Actually, considering the fact that lymphoid tumors are the most reponsive to glucocorticoids and the results from my last linked study, your veterinary might probably be right! Anyway, good luck!

9240	9243	Hi! Interesting answer. Thanks. Though, do you have some references to backup you claims (in accordance with Health SE policies)? Particularly concerning your claims that _"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been shown to be as effective or more effective than medication in both short and long term management of anxiety, PTSD, panic disorder, agoraphobia." I think backuping up this statement with a link to some studies might be useful. Thank you. BW	2016-09-14 21:35:30Z	S.Victor
9240	9243	Agree with S.Victor. Two questions: 1. why a psychologist and not a psychiatrist? 2. I think it would also be interesting to have some references for the part "ALL humans develop maladaptive patterns to stressful events in their life when growing up that influence their neuropsychological processing of external and internal stimuli throughout life". Finally, if I may: I really don't want to be rude, but even a MD should provide some references to his answer. MDs who publish papers do backup their claims with references. I think this should be the same on health SE. Cheers! Felipe	2016-09-14 21:54:24Z	Felipe
9240	9243	Thanks @Doctor Whom for editing your answer with references. I am however not convinced by your answer in general which I find too much advocating CBT in favor of pharmacothery without providing the references for a superiority of CBT over pharmacotherpay.  Also, you say "This sounds very much like depression with components of anxiety." (interesting diagnosis, not sure the question provides all the DSM criteria) but you mainly link evidence (your meta-analysis) for CBT for generalised anxiety disorders and not depression.	2016-09-15 20:20:38Z	Felipe
9240	9243	Though, according to uptodate, depression should be first addressed with pharmacotherapy. Furthermore your medscape link states " The combination approach yields superior results for most patients compared to either single modality", which is something which doesn't reflect in your answer where you mainly talk about CBT. Finally, your way of addressing depression/anxiety might be different from other clinics and hospitals.	2016-09-15 20:20:56Z	Felipe
9240	9243	Anyway, I think answering those "looking for personal medical advice question" can lead you to a very slippery slope as you really don't have enough background (positive family history? Drug abuse?) to provide a reliable answer. In my opinion, your answer isn't really based on objective evidences (also example "I recommend psychologist for all marriages" --> evidence?). Hope you understand my points. See you soon on other health SE questions! Cheers!	2016-09-15 20:21:11Z	Felipe

9232	9234	The flour we use comes from grinding raw wheat from a nearby Grinder. So does it satisfy my needs for B Vitamins - {B12}? And yes, wheat breads(it's called roti I here)  are consumed three times a day.	2016-09-14 08:44:57Z	
9232	9234	If you haven't removed the bran and germ from the wheat before processing it then you can consider it "whole grain". As I said, bread alone will not completely satisfy your needs for B Vitamins. Bread/Roti will only give you B3 and B6.	2016-09-14 08:57:41Z	JJosaur

Because the link you have provided, gives a number: "If you’re less than 25% off your normal mark, go on to the following steps, but if your number is off by more, get to an emergency room, he said, because this indicates that there is a serious problem".

9220	9267	Yeah, sorry for my bad wording, actually I meant preventing allergic reactions to give the atopic eczema a chance to calm down and heal a bit. I also added cooked apples to the diet, which is okay according to the doc. I'm also conscious that this diet is nothing permanent but should only last a week or two until more and more food is added back to the menu. Which food would you suggest to add first based on which missing nutrients are most important?	2016-09-16 19:09:24Z	
9220	9267	Meat. Or some other source of protein you know is not an issue for you.	2016-09-16 19:16:29Z	Kate Gregory

9190	9214	Thank you for the clarification. Is there another fine name for 'pure muscular diseases' or muscular diseases that are not MSD?	2016-09-13 10:32:01Z	
9190	9214	From my knowledge, no (and actually the ICD 10 tells the same, all muscular diseases are listed in the MSD chapter also those which are secondary to a disorder). "Pure muscular diseases" are called myopathies and are listed under the "soft tissue disorders". Although, most of these myopathies relate to skeletal muscle, description of pure "smooth muscle disorders" in the literature is sparse. There is the desmin myopathy, which can also affect smooth muscle (in addition to skeletal and cardia muscle) and probably it would also fit in the "Disorders of muscles" (M60-M63) subcategory. BW	2016-09-13 10:44:02Z	S.Victor
9190	9214	@ÉbeIsaac, it may help if you tell for what exact purpose you need to classify these diseases. By pure muscle diseases you probably mean those that affect mainly muscle fibers and not tendons and joints. I also edited my answer.	2016-09-13 11:42:21Z	Jan
9190	9214	@ÉbeIsaac. Actually, I have just seen that some muscular disorders (myopathies) are also listed under the "Diseases of the nervous system" Chapter in the ICD-10. Those diseases affect muscles but are also associated with neurological conditions. Hence their "classification" under "Disease of the nervous system". Idem for myasthenia gravis or lambert eaton, which are diseases of the neuromuscular junction. Hope this brought some clarifications. BW	2016-09-13 15:32:22Z	S.Victor
9178	9180	Thank you very much for your interesting and detailed reply.  It's very interesting that 'HIIT'-style exercise didn't help, but gentle cardio (walking) did.  I'm extremely interested in one of your bullet points where you say "we don't limit fats or protein".  I can really understand the fat side of things, but the unlimited protein really has me intrigued.  I thought that excess protein caused the liver to create glucose, which would counteract the low carb approach?	2016-09-11 11:02:28Z	
9178	9180	I'll refer you to the books and articles about low carb to be sure, but -- maybe it's because the digestion of protein takes longer.  The exercise thing has to do with adrenaline.  Diabetics are told to walk regularly and to do some gentle strength training.	2016-09-12 04:21:42Z	aparente001

9160	9166	Thanks! I've been diagnosed with PCOS abt 6 yrs ago & take treatment for it so I understand point #2. I did not disclose that, but, yes, that is an important detail I should have included. For #3, I'm living in Canada, and unfortunately I don't think they readily offer "outpatient diagnostic procedures" unless you've tried all other options. They make it really difficult - otherwise, I would be fine w/it bc I'd prefer a solid diagnosis! I do have a ? for #1: are you saying that it's not uncommon for Dr.'s to do that or that it's not impacting him so he doesn't have my best interest in mind?	2016-09-10 17:24:17Z	
9160	9166	@user51778, I can't speak about your doctor, but since both endometriosis and the suggested treatment are both serious, getting investigation-confirmed diagnosis is a good idea. I should point out that laparoscopy can detect only superficial endometriosis, so it can not reveal it in all cases; MRI is probably better: pubs.rsna.org/doi/pdf/10.1148/rg.326125518 . One possible approach is to start some elimination diet, such a low-FODMAP diet, to see if certain nutrients are triggers of GIT issues. If no help in a week, gastroenterologist can do some tests.	2016-09-10 17:46:32Z	Jan

9146	9147	Although this is technically a good answer, I think the diet will result in more muscle loss than fat loss due to the lack of protein, and if it's continued for very long it's a downright unhealthy diet.	2016-09-09 01:56:22Z	Carey Gregory
9146	9147	While that might seem correct Carey, the body doesn't change what it chooses to lose based on what you are eating. There may be some muscular atrophy but not more than fat loss.	2016-09-09 06:34:38Z	JJosaur
9146	9184	Bingo. This is exactly what I was trying to convey in my comments to JJ's answer.	2016-09-10 22:41:51Z	Carey Gregory
9146	9184	Thank you so much for such an informative answer. Will search more to make a decision.	2016-09-12 04:44:50Z	
9144	9145	Thanks for the answer! So for clarification, it's normal for the darkened colors (even at the beginning)? I knew that the change to dark near the end of the length of the period was normal, but I didn't know whether it was normal to start off being tarry and black like? I didn't know if the the highest amount of enometrial and necrotic cells would be darker or brighter?	2016-09-08 21:15:28Z	
9144	9145	Hi. At the beginning, the changes in hormonal concentrations (which eventually lead to menstruation) are such, that the constriction of the vessels in the endometrium lead to a great part of the stratum functionalis to be cleaved. That's why the first days contain the highest content. Towards the end, the hormonal concentrations start to change, the new layer has slowly started to form, hence the reduced discharge and the possible change in colour (although this is a very subjective parameter). Note that this concerns "physiological" cases, e.g contraceptive use or IUD may change this. BR	2016-09-10 08:15:04Z	M. Arrowsmith
9138	9140	Hi @S.Victor. Thanks for your answer, very interesting. Two small points: 1.could you maybe provide risk factors for infections following cat bites? This study provides some RF: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1823783. 2. could you add maybe add a small table of the most frequent pathogens following cat bites. This study provides an interesting table: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122494. Hope you understand my points. Thank you in advance. Best regards. M.Arrowsmith	2016-09-07 19:19:03Z	M. Arrowsmith
9138	9140	Thanks for reviewing and improving my answer M.Arrowsmith ;-) You are right, it makes more sense now. BW	2016-09-07 20:04:50Z	S.Victor
9138	9140	Thanks a lot @S.Victor for the detailed explanation. Just had one last question. What if my cat is treated with anti-rabbies vaccination? Will the above answer still be valid? Just curious! :)	2016-09-09 10:10:32Z	
9138	9140	Hi @iDeveloper. If your cat's rabies vaccination is uptodate, their shouldn't be any risk for rabies transmission. However, this concerns only rabies, the other listed pathogens are not covered by the vaccine so you could potentially be infected by those pathogens. The best thing to do (as suggested in one of the reviews and their listed risk factors for serious infections following cat bites) is to see a health prof. if you get bitten by a cat (in particular if you are immunocompromised). Hope this brought some clarification. Best wishes. S.Victor	2016-09-13 09:47:53Z	S.Victor

9124	9130	Nice answer.  Legumes (e.g. peas, beans) have a lot going for them.  Perhaps you could combine a serving of legumes with a serving of meat, eggs or tofu, so you're getting the best of both worlds.	2016-09-10 04:25:49Z	aparente001
9122	9123	Thanks for the answer! I plan on stopping the workout, because I don't want to do anything more than what is medically healthy. And about my diet, I don't measure my food, but I stay away from junk food, and don't eat not healthy foods. I also don't eat too much starch, and fatty foods.	2016-09-05 21:24:38Z

9101	9121	Great answer. "In general liquid forms would be absorbed faster" - is it just because they're already solubilized?	2016-09-05 21:13:57Z	Mango Princess
9101	9121	@MangoPrincess Because liquids go through the stomach faster and reach the small intestine (where they are absorbed) earlier. So, the absorption would be faster for several minutes to few hours. This can be important if you need an effect as fast as possible, but this is rarely the case. When supplements are urgently needed you need to get them by an intravenous infusion, anyway.	2016-09-06 08:08:43Z	Jan
9095	9098	@Count Iblis. Thank you for your comment (and obviously for downvoting my answer). The misleading isn’t really objective IMO but I think we have got your point that “no oil is better” in your answer below.  I had a look at two of your linked studies (not the youtube video, maybe providing a link to the studies by Esselstyn et al would be interesting):	2016-09-04 08:08:50Z	M. Arrowsmith
9095	9098	The first one (published nearly a decade ago, where authors used very fatty diet with 25g of oil) suggests that the effect of olive oil on endothelial function could be negative. Though, it would be worth mentioning the other 29 studies published on the topic. Indeed a recent systematic review (2015) identified a total of 30 studies on this particular topic and revealed that olive oil might be beneficial for endothelial function although results were associated with some heterogeneity (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4586551).	2016-09-04 08:09:19Z	M. Arrowsmith
9095	9098	Your second study about primitive societies is interesting but you don’t mention possible confounding factors such as genetic susceptibility which could also explain the results (as suggested here ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20031563).	2016-09-04 08:09:30Z	M. Arrowsmith
9095	9098	Finally, I think that the work by Esselstyn et al are interesting. But what about randomised controlled trials? Are there any? Observational studies are prone for multiple bias. Have they done a long term prospective trial? One of the main limitation of Esselstyn theory is probably that evidence from randomised trials are missing. So, I don’t want to argue with you. Probably both “opinions” share strength and limitations. Best regards.	2016-09-04 08:09:52Z	M. Arrowsmith
9095	9098	Thanks for the link, however the study isn't randomized/controlled, so suffers from some limitations. I think I understand your point. But hope you will agree with me, that larger randomized controlled studies are needed (or even studies comparing one diet to another diet for example without oil at all). Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-09-04 18:31:00Z	M. Arrowsmith
9094	9097	How about for women too? A friend told me "you won't be able to have babies if you bike everyday" but we were 8 years old then and I didn't believe her	2016-09-04 00:10:16Z	Mango Princess
9094	9097	@MangoPrincess. Hi! Well, I haven't heard anything about cycling and potential association with female infertility. And my research for evidence-based studies did not provide any concluding results. I think, that a "possible" explanation could be: intense exercise --> hormonal dysregulation --> infertility. But this means, its due to intense physical activity and not cycling specially. I mentionned this point in a previous question about fertility in general: health.stackexchange.com/questions/9010/…. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-09-04 08:17:14Z	M. Arrowsmith
9094	9097	It would be worth repeating this study as bike saddle design has changed drastically in the last 10 years due to this.	2016-09-04 13:01:43Z	JohnP
9094	9097	Hi JohnP, well, I think that some studies are quite recent: the last study by Hollingon et al was conducted from from October 2012 to July 2013 and the study by Maleki et al took place in 2015. But indeed, I think it would even be worth comparing different bike saddle design and see whether there is an association with ED or change in semen quality/morphology. Best regards.

9083	9107	Hi! Actually when you click on the number (1 or 2), this should direct you to the two studies. Unfortunately, the last study conducted in postoperative care, could not provide a cellular mechanism on how caffeine could induce nausea and I did not find any study neither investigating this on a cellular level. I think that further studies are needed to clarify this. BW	2016-09-06 16:48:21Z	S.Victor
9083	9107	Hi @S.Victor! Interesting answer. Thank you. How about adding your comment regarding the cellular mechanisms of caffeine on nausea in your answer? This would answer (or at least address) the part "what is the mechanism for caffeine causing nausea" in the original question. Thanks. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-09-07 15:28:16Z	M. Arrowsmith
9083	9107	Indeed @M.Arrowsmith, that would make more sense! Thanks for the suggestion! BW	2016-09-07 15:34:25Z	S.Victor
9073	9077	Good answer, and it is important to emphasize the word "CAN" - the effects depend on the individual's anatomy/physiology, as well as the quantity, timing, accompanying foods, etc.	2016-10-03 06:39:47Z	DoctorWhom
9073	9077	CAN is not a direct term. It's also important to remember than CAN does not mean it will or won't. It's a wishy washy term that has a vague definition. It's scientifically not accepted as a proper term in many fields of study. It's just more of an outword comforting term for a patient, and a scapegoat word to avoid implicating yourself into an incorrect diagnosis if that situation occurs.	2016-10-03 14:41:42Z	cloudnyn3
9067	9102	What happens when someone goes to the bathroom and doesn't touch excreta or perhaps even any waste product? I'm reminded of the old joke about the biologist who, at university, learned to follow standard hygienic practices, the chemist who learned to be thorough (washes his hands for 20 minutes before and 20 minutes after using the bathroom), and the engineer who learned not to pee all over his hands (and therefore sees no added value in hand washing). For example, do pathogens lie in wait on toilet seats and then proactively leap 2 or 3 meters onto the hands of people passing by?	2017-09-25 21:02:39Z	Robert Columbia
9062	13790	Welcome to Health.SE, Wendy. This site works different to most Q&A’s, as we expect claims to be backed up with references. One’s Health is a delicate issue, and we had too mc h spam here. These references of yours are not reliable. It would be great if you could find studies supporting your claim and edit your answer.	2017-09-27 13:56:36Z	Narusan-in-coma
9055	9390	This is a very interesting answer. Thank you. Even if the OP might not have the same definition for "big people" as you, this remains a very useful answer and sheds some interesting knowledge on ageing and obesity. +1. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-09-28 15:03:03Z	M. Arrowsmith
9044	9058	+1 For such a broad question this is a great answer!	2016-08-31 15:10:52Z	JJosaur

9044	9058	I learned about this topic while I was in school studying for my exercise physiology degree. I'm sure you can google glycogen water weight and find gobs of info on the topic.	2016-09-03 02:57:58Z	Korbin
9036	9040	Hi! Excellent point. Though, I think you should contrast your answer by taking into account those two studies/reviews suggesting that HR might also vary according to the sleep cycle (NREM/REM). ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12738405 and ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3797399. Thanks. BW	2016-08-31 17:36:39Z	S.Victor
9024	13023	Please add some references... Well written response though!	2017-07-19 15:40:51Z	L.B.
9024	13023	It is also worth noting that abs tend to appear 12% or lower on the body though a major factor is also genetics.  Some show at 15% while others you need to be under 10%.  As you stated, due to the difference in natural body fat, men tend to show more so than females.	2017-07-19 18:04:26Z	ggiaquin16
9024	9033	+1 for recognizing that "abs" are more about body fat than muscle. Reduce your body fat percentage to the minimum and you'll have "abs" even without crunches. Conversely, you could have the most well developed abdominal muscles ever and still not have visible "abs" if they're under a layer of body fat. Since the minimum (healthy) body fat percentage for women is about 14% vs 6% for men, for a woman to have comparable "abs" would require her to drop to an unhealthy fat level.	2016-08-29 18:16:46Z	Carey Gregory
9024	9033	-1 for literally everything else in your answer apart from a basic understanding that abs are about body fat percentage. There is a lot that is incorrect here.	2016-08-31 15:35:35Z	JJosaur
9024	9033	This post has the makings of a very good answer, but here on Health, we strongly encourage using references. They are the only way in which we can tell if information is reliable or not.

9017	9018	Hi Arrowsmith. Thanks for your answer. I'm currently editing my question because I've realized it is still not specific enough.	2016-08-26 21:22:59Z	
9017	9018	Now that i've read your article I'm interested in the part of the driving pressure: difference between mean arterial pressure and intracranial one. I'll try searching more information using that.	2016-08-26 21:34:33Z	
9017	9018	Ok. I have read your edit of the question. Though, I still think that the review in my answer provides a good overview. You can then deepen your understanding by reading the different references used by the authors to undertake their review. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-26 21:38:12Z	M. Arrowsmith
9017	9018	Yes. In fact I was searching for more specific terminology to obtain more specific references. Thanks!	2016-08-26 21:40:39Z	
9017	9018	Ok. Perfect. Good luck with your research. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-26 21:44:31Z	M. Arrowsmith

9000	9001	Thank you it provided me some good knowledge about things. Could you please tell if being underweight can also cause digestion problems? Also, can gas be the reason for constipation?	2016-08-25 16:50:00Z	
9000	9001	Being somewhat underweight by itself should not be a reason for constipation or digestive problems of any kind. Being underweight because of poor diet resulting in nutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency, could contribute to constipation, though. Iron deficiency may be more common in vegans. They are blood tests for mineral and vitamin deficiencies available. I also updated my answer above.	2016-08-25 18:37:16Z	Jan
9000	9001	Theoretically, excessive gas could worsen constipation, because pain from bloating could make you constipated, but this is overthinking and I don't know if it leads anywhere. The focus should be on removing gas-producing and constipating foods and concentrating on work goals.	2016-08-26 08:52:18Z	Jan
9000	9001	Are apples and bananas good in IBS? At that site, banana is listed in Low FODMAP so it should be okay. Apple is in High. Should I quit apples to stop gas problems?	2016-08-26 11:51:54Z	
9000	9001	Yes, that's one thing. Sometimes you need to ignore what people say not swallow everything.	2016-09-07 07:22:14Z	Jan
9000	9015	How do I know if the gas is in Large intestine or in lower part of small intestine?	2016-08-27 07:17:22Z	
9000	9015	@Johan, this answer is confusing. SIBO can cause gas and nutrient deficiencies, that's true. SIBO is possible, but not the first thing to think of and it needs to be diagnosed and treated by a doctor. Stopping eating all the fiber very likely aggravates constipation. Starving for 2 weeks is not appropriate in this scenario...	2016-08-27 10:27:34Z	Jan
8998	9012	It's part regulatory, but I'd say that's more or less standard for a new product. The problem here is that the market is too small to justify large expenses to get past the FDA (because everything has to be tested & equivalence has to be proven). Competitors also run the risk that when they finally enter the market, Mylan will just return the price to $100, ruining all profit margins.	2016-08-26 12:02:17Z	VonBeche
8992	9002	So suppose there is actually no cavity, but the dentist made some kind of mistake expecting a cavity... The dentist does cavity preparation. Does he damage the tooth? What happens to the healthy tooth in this case?	2016-08-26 01:49:04Z	
8992	9002	In theory, the tooth structure is weakened, but if the restauration is minimalist, done properly, and you maintain proper hygiene, there should be little difference with the original/healthy tooth.	2016-08-26 03:30:39Z	enap_mwf

8988	8989	HOMA-IR is the most commonly calculated parameter to estimate insulin resistance. It is favoured in clinical medicine, since only fasting insulin and fasting glucose concentrations are needed. The gold standard for determining insulin resistance is the glucose clamp investigation. It is elaborate and work-intensive, and therefore used in clinical trials only.	2016-09-12 18:18:46Z	jwdietrich
8971	8974	A vasovagal syncope episode might be a better reference of what is described, related to straining. Also, the etiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage is more complex, and the study referenced in the CBS coverage was in Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association, published May 5, 2011. It was specific to those individuals already diagnosed with an aneurysm and ways to reduce their rupture risk.	2016-08-24 15:12:27Z	Giorgio
8971	8974	@Dorothy Yeah, I know. Hence my notation that that wasn't really the best reference that I could have. And I am quite sure that straining that hard cannot possibly good for one's head. Regardless, I will make some slight changes to my answer.	2016-08-24 15:14:47Z	L.B.

8959	12767	Would you somehow be able to fiddle in citation(s) that stopping drugs/alcohol etc. will help with a heart attack? I know it's rather trivial, but your answer would then serve as a good role-model for new users who we request to include references.	2017-06-27 19:52:25Z	Narusan-in-coma
8959	12767	@Narusan Done. They're not all the most rigorous citations, but I chose them for directly addressing the specific issue and showing how it would produce immediate results.	2017-06-27 22:07:00Z	Carey Gregory
8959	12767	Thank you for grasping was I was attempting to convey.  This is exactly the type of information I was looking for in an answer.  Much appreciated.	2017-06-29 01:08:16Z	
8959	12771	This diet (whatever it is - I won't sit through a video to find out) is going to have an effect in 30 days? I find that difficult to believe.	2017-06-28 13:40:22Z	Carey Gregory
8959	12771	@CareyGregory It won't reverse atherosclerosis on that time scale, but eating junk food has an immediate negative effect apart from the long term problems this causes, so if you eat junk foods regularly and if you can look into the future and see that you're going have a heart attack in a month, then not eating junk foods may well do the trick. See also here.	2017-06-28 23:37:21Z	Count Iblis
8959	12771	Also note that the landmark study comparing the Mediterranean diet to the one that was traditionally prescribed to heart patients was stopped prematurely by the ethics committee because of a lot more heart attacks in the group that was eating the traditional diet. So, there is also an effect of diet on a short time scale.	2017-06-28 23:38:15Z	Count Iblis
8959	12771	I'm sorry, but I find it almost impossible to believe you can reverse (or even affect) decades of vascular disease in one month. And again, I won't watch videos. If you can't find the evidence in written form, then I don't believe it exists.	2017-06-29 01:49:22Z	Carey Gregory
8959	12771	@CareyGregory I didn't say that. It takes a long time to reverse the disease, but you can immediately get rid of factors such as the higher blood pressure due to eating salt by simply drastically reducing salt intake. If a piece of plaque is going to rupture if you go on eating a normal diet and you take away the salt, then the drop in blood pressure may just prevent that. Drastically reducing salt intake falls within the OP's criterion of a non-medical intervention. Give that we need less than half a gram of salt per day and most people get more than a few grams, this is possible to do.	2017-06-29 02:12:12Z	Count Iblis

8953	8955	@Santropedro, no, I mean toothpastes. This is analogous to sandpaper - it's the "sand" part that's abrasive, not the "paper" part. Both paper and toothbrush function as extensions of our own hands holding proper abrasive material.	2016-10-05 08:46:36Z	Grzegorz Adam Kowalski
8953	8955	Thanks! You are right! It was unintuitive to me that a non-solid substance could be abrasive. I saw the toothbrush as the only possibility. The world is surprising!	2016-10-05 18:17:31Z	Santropedro

8920	8921	Hi! No problem. Well, I found the literature regarding diphenhydramine relatively sparse so it's difficult to say as nobody has tested the "cyclic administration" before (to my knowledge). I was wondering whether you have already seen a sleep specialist? This might also be a solution. Good luck, Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-20 19:52:02Z	M. Arrowsmith
8918	8926	Efficacy of multivitamin supplements is just one side of the coin. As @Milo Martinovich's answer suggests, the other important aspect is the gradual degradation of nutrients in plant food over last few decades. At least, this is something that could be objectively proven, and if found true, should at least become a major health concern to us, whether supplements are effective or not.	2016-08-22 17:40:39Z	
8918	8926	@PrahladYeri You would never to be able to prove/disprove that generally, with a single statement that encompasses all "plant food". You could only show that in small isolated areas (and sure, it's valuable info). And it's the same with "are supplements beneficial/harmful". I contend that all claims of this nature depend on the person and on the environment, and so that is why such "studies" about supplements, plant nutrient quality, you name it, have been and shall remain inconclusive. General conclusions can not be draw, there is just too much variance across the not-so-small planet.	2016-08-22 18:12:10Z	Jason C
8918	8926	(Plus just trying to define "degradation of nutrients" would be controversial and inconclusive in itself. What would that even mean? "Degradation" can mean anything, not to mention the personal variance of its effects, if any. "Nutrients" is a massive varying category of things, different supplements have different efficacies for different people. It would be just as inconclusive and [un]intentionally biased a set of studies as the supplement question being asked here. There are just too many variables, not to mention too many agendas.)	2016-08-22 18:15:34Z	Jason C
8918	8926	This is an excellent answer!	2017-06-20 14:11:57Z	Narusan-in-coma
8918	8926	I think special mention of pediatric cases and studies is worth mentioning, where the research seems less ambiguous. It's also worth pointing common deficiencies in vegetarian diets to avoid, given the op. Still +1	2017-06-21 17:39:51Z	Atl LED
8918	8923	Yes, your answer makes more sense. Multivitamin supplement's job is to compensate for deficiency in vitamins, minerals and other micro nutrients in our diet. Cancer and Heart disease are hardly any examples of diseases arising from malnutrition of vitamins, so I don't see how those studies are relevant at all to this question.	2016-08-20 22:09:49Z	
8918	8923	This would be a better answer if it quoted studies about the vitamin/mineral benefits. Right now it offers no evidence that we do not live "in a perfect world" and that people lack those micronutrients. I don't really doubt it, but the question asked for an objective answer, not hand-waving.	2016-08-21 08:33:35Z	Hassassin
8918	8923	scientificamerican.com/article/… Here is a article referencing a couple studies proving lower amounts of micronutrients in fruits and vegetables produced today versus decades ago. These new findings aren't found with the nutrition facts of foods so you can easily overestimate the micronutrients you intake daily if you follow nutrition labels/facts for fruits and vegetables.	2016-08-21 19:10:09Z	Milo Martinovich
8918	8923	@MiloMartinovich, that's still only half the premise. Ok, some foods contain less of these micronutrients than they used to. However, is that enough to push the intake below the recommended minimum?	2016-08-22 06:21:55Z	Hassassin
8918	8923	@MiloMartinovich 1. You said "They can also provide benefits beyond the RDA for certain vitamins/minerals." You did not provide any evidence for this claim. 2. Vitamin degradation in foods that occurs with time is a known thing. This does not automatically mean you do not get enough nutrients by eating foods you can buy in stores. 3. The article (not a study) in Scientificamerican does not prove that foods you can buy today contain so little nutrients that you would need supplements.	2016-08-22 09:04:00Z	Jan
8918	8919	Interesting. The first two sources reached a conclusion that there isn't any benefit of dietary supplements, whereas the third one reached to the contrary?	2016-08-20 18:11:36Z	
8918	8919	@PrahladYeri No. The Dietary Guidelines say that "in some cases," which means in individuals with inadequate intake from foods, supplements may be useful. You designed your question for individuals with adequate nutrient intake, which therefore need no supplements according to all 3 reviews. I copy-pasted the exact claim from the Guidelines and I must say it sounds misleading.	2016-08-20 18:15:30Z	Jan
8918	8919	There is also the question of who decides whether the micro-nutrients you consume are adequate or not? (especially concerning for vegetarians). We don't have electronic meters yet that show you have X amounts of Vit-A or Y amounts of Vit-C in your body. Besides, considering the constant environmental degradation going on since millennia, isn't it probable that a lot of people will be falling short of that nutrient adequacy by consuming plant food alone?	2016-08-20 18:28:14Z	
8918	8919	Note that the abstract for the actual Johns Hopkins study concludes with the absurdly inconclusive, and probably biased, "Although available evidence does not rule out small benefits or harms or large benefits or harms in a small subgroup of the population, we believe that the case is closed— supplementing the diet of well-nourished adults with (most) mineral or vitamin supplements has no clear benefit and might even be harmful." -- The issue really is so up in the air that anybody can pretty much find any data to support any viewpoint.	2016-08-21 00:30:31Z	Jason C
8918	8919	And you do kinda have to lol at "does not rule out small benefits or harms or large benefits or harms in a small subgroup ... we believe that the case is closed", because i.imgur.com/LinOE3w.jpg.	2016-08-21 00:33:11Z	Jason C
8918	8962	Thanks, this answer brings a lot of new information. You may ask the Doc what exactly is lacking in your usual vegetarian/non-vegetarian diet for which you should take the supplements, and also whether there are any studies that show any concrete evidence for the efficacy of the supplements?	2016-08-23 21:16:50Z

8888	8893	HI @Mislam. Ok, thanks for the complement of information. This shifted the diagnosis to an ischemic stroke. I have provided some edit to my answer. Hope this helps. I will also edit a little bit your question as this might be seen as a question asking for "personal medical advice" which is not well seen on Health SE. What I would also suggest is that you maybe remove the CT scan report. I will write the main findings in the question. Again, this avoids the question to be flagged as "personal". Hope this helps. Good luck to your uncle. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-20 19:43:04Z	M. Arrowsmith
8888	8893	Thank you very much for clarification on this matter. I will remove the report	2016-08-20 21:47:44Z	
8877	8892	What is taurine? I am fine with consuming caffeine, but I don't consume coffee or tea.	2017-02-15 06:53:54Z	
8873	8903	Hello, putting those articles in order of study/publication would improve readability.	2017-06-12 09:42:17Z	Tyto alba
8873	8874	Interesting.  If my math is correct, that would be over 11 8-ounce glasses of water for females and nearly 16 8-ource glasses of water for males... every day.	2016-08-17 20:13:00Z	
8873	8874	@RockPaperLizard, the Adequate Intake is "population-based" estimation -- it means 3.7 liters of water per day is enough for 98% young males -- both those who sweat a lot and little. If you sweat a little (sedentary life style), it is much more likely you'll need 1.5-2 liters than 3.7 liters. And if you sweat a lot (sport training every day), you may need more than 4-5 liters a day. It's like how much gasoline you need to put in the car....it depends how much you spend it.	2016-08-18 12:25:06Z	Jan
8855	8872	This answers my question. I asked this on the basis of a "belief" which is popular in Indian Yoga. Please watch this textual video on YouTube, youtube.com/watch?v=F6t9RQmagzI you'll understand why I asked this question. Furthe I would like to know the reason why the methods given in Yoga and this video cure diseases like Constipation or IBS? They say if you perform these Yogas or methods the navel beat is centered? Really?	2016-08-17 12:01:38Z	
8855	8872	I am not sure about what you understand by navel beat so I can't help you on this. Concerning the influence of yoga on constipation and IBS, I have never heard of this (but haven't searched the medical literature tbh). Maybe you should ask this a separate new question? Cheers! Felipe	2016-08-19 08:54:49Z	Felipe
8855	8864	What if intestine is swollen because of any disease like IBS? Wouldn't that affect location of beat?	2016-08-17 10:53:17Z	
8850	8851	I agree. Where could this myth have surfaced?	2016-08-15 23:24:07Z	Adamawesome4
8850	8851	This is all planned against the ones who care about health :0	2016-08-16 19:17:18Z	ABcDexter
8850	8862	Yeah you are right, I know it sounds stupid, that's what I thought when I read it the first time but then I found it on websites like:   	urdumania.net/foods-you-should-not-eat-together and this one: learningdays.tumblr.com/post/24606562484/… and this is what made me curious to find out the truth. Thank you!	2016-08-17 12:07:18Z	
8850	8862	@LamiaKouba That tumblr link is ridiculous. According to that, almost every food is toxic when mixed with anything else. If you followed their advice virtually every dish in every culture would be "toxic".	2016-08-17 14:17:23Z	Carey Gregory
8850	8862	I second @CareyGregory. Also, i can not recall anything like that written in Ayurveda. Yes, some mixtures are not good for health, but certainly not these two.	2016-08-18 10:05:22Z	ABcDexter
8845	9148	Thanks! I wanted to find something about how blood sugar affect in turn, but did not find aynthing useful so far.	2016-09-09 10:31:42Z	vidstige
8845	9148	Like heck it's "not even that hard". The only non-sugary drinks you can find when eating out are nasty diet sodas, unsweetened ice tea, and water.	2017-09-09 03:59:58Z	Shawn V. Wilson
8845	9148	Dried fruits and white sugar are bad, whole grains are good -- so how about oatmeal raisin cookies? Are they "less bad"?	2017-09-09 04:01:21Z	Shawn V. Wilson
8845	9148	@ShawnV.Wilson Water, wine? Sweet drinks drowns out the taste from most food imho. Kebab is an exceptions there I def need a coke. :-)	2017-09-09 05:45:15Z	vidstige
8845	9148	@ShawnV.Wilson dried fruit very sweet, yes, but they also has lots of fiber, so relating to this specific question they are better than white sugar. What are you comparing oatmeal raisin cookies with? In general, check the sugar content (I also look for aspartam and stuff and avoid that), the less the better when it come to food. For desserts and so on, I personally don't worry so much. :-) But relating to this quetion, eating desserts after meals reduces the blood sugar spike. E.g. if you take a oatmeal rasin cookie in the afternoon, it'll make you more tired than taking it after dinner, etc.	2017-09-09 05:48:16Z	vidstige
8842	8849	Says who?  ;-)  I agree with everything you said, but citations are generally expected here.	2016-08-15 18:23:31Z	Carey Gregory
8842	8849	Also, there is actual evidence that when it comes to weight loss, limiting calories is the more important factor of the two; exercise has a much greater role in maintaining weight loss.  I will look for the sources... Sustainability is the key though.	2017-08-11 04:23:31Z	DoctorWhom
8842	8849	@DoctorWhom - Yes. I'll have to dig around on fitness a bit, but when I was researching for a question there, I found a few studies that compared all the typical diets (Paleo, South Beach, Keto, etc etc) and for sustainable weight loss, calorie restriction was king. I know it's there somewhere, I'll just have to find it. IIRC, calorie restriction and intermittent fasting (IF) also reduced aging biomarkers as well.	2018-01-12 21:05:46Z	JohnP
8813	8815	Thanks for the source. I ended up using this one and MeSH term dictionary.	2016-10-22 22:47:41Z

8732	8800	If you already have diabetes, then eating carbs is not helpful. But you get diabetes by eating a low carb high fat diet. The human body is designed to get all its energy needs from carbs, you can't get it all from fats. Fats are empty caloriesm they contain virtually no nutrients. Contrast this with the nutrients in whole grain bread, brown rice and whole grain pasta. This means that to maximize the nutrient intake requires eating only healthy carbs and no fats. The only essential fats are Omega 3 and Omega 6 fats, but 1000 Kcal worth of brown rice contains enough of these essential fats.	2016-08-12 00:01:59Z	Count Iblis
8732	8800	Wow @CountIblis are you trolling or do you actually believe that someone can live on no fat (apart from omega 3) at all?	2016-08-12 06:42:46Z	JJosaur
8732	8800	@Golden grain, you have the beginning of a good answer, can you expand on your explanation and add links to relevant evidence for claims?	2016-08-12 06:43:34Z	JJosaur

8732	8800	To many diabetics the sane way to handle their malady is to take as few drugs as possible (except Metformin, which actually is showing many benefits), because of the horrible side effects - increased appitite, cancer, etc.	2016-08-13 11:45:03Z	goldengrain
8728	8752	So muscle cells act as the brain (among others) and do not need insulin.  I already could guess this. Could you please bring more details about this special behaviour ?	2016-08-09 19:01:03Z	
8728	8752	@Stphane I edited the answer and added some more details.	2016-08-09 19:15:50Z	Lamia Kouba

8728	8752	Less insulin -- not no insulin. Type 1 diabetics (barring certain exceptions, like honeymooners) ALWAYS need some insulin. For short (<2 hr) of exercise, they can go without, because the rapid acting insulins used in pumps today are active for at least that long. For longer amounts of time, insulin will need to be taken. (Diabetics taking long acting insulin will be fine; those insulins are active for 12-24 hours.)	2017-06-25 21:21:53Z	Shokhet

8691	14637	Are you sure the skin damage is due to acidity? It seems like acidity sufficient to damage skin would do even more damage to the intestines, so you definitely need to provide a source to support that.	2017-12-10 18:08:16Z	Carey Gregory
8685	8686	Excellent! That was exactly what I was looking for! Thanks a lot.	2016-08-04 15:18:34Z	
8685	8686	@S.Victor, sorry to be picky here (though +1 for providing different tools for different ethnies/group of patients), but "it predicts a person's chance of having a heart attack" --> is this really a chance? :-p Maybe it would be worth considering changing to "it predicts a person's risk of having a heart attack"?

8682	8749	Interesting answer. The article by Wiesenfeld really offers a good review on the topic! Thank you for this input. Though, you may wish to consider adding a reference regarding the difference in kappa opioids produced analgesia in women and men? For example, following article published in Nature is considered as a "historical" study on this subject: Gear RW et al. Kappa-opioids produce significantly greater analgesia in women than in men. Nat Med. 1996 Nov;2(11):1248-50 (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8898754). Best wishes.	2016-08-09 20:18:17Z	S.Victor

8682	8692	I'm not criticizing your answer, but is Mythbusters really the best evidence out there? Has no one ever published on this question in a peer reviewed journal? Maybe they haven't, but I would find that a little surprising.	2016-08-05 22:33:34Z	Carey Gregory
8682	8692	I'm sure there is better evidence, I just had this info "to hand"	2016-08-05 22:46:08Z	JJosaur
8682	8692	I too saw that Mythbusters episode and have an issue with their methods. If you tossed the data from those who were exceptionally immune to pain, which is an individual phenomena, I believe the data would be statistically insignificant. There was one woman who was the exception.	2016-08-12 20:27:50Z	BillDOe

8676	8857	One coconut might make one meal for an adult, and maybe they could (barely) survive long-term on three per day. If the coconuts are shipped whole, a week's worth for 1000 people would be 3000 coconuts. I'm pretty sure that will fill a large truck. Meanwhile, the same large truck loaded with dried rice and beans would feed those 1000 people for a full year or more (and would provide far more rounded nutrition). I suppose you could remove the coconut meat instead of shipping it whole, but then you have to dry it to preserve it, and you lose the coconut water which contains significant nutrients.	2016-08-16 17:48:06Z	Carey Gregory
7670	7672	This is exactly what I was looking for.	2016-08-03 19:09:37Z	
7670	7672	I wonder if there is a database that can be downloaded into Access or Excel.	2016-08-03 22:40:23Z	BillDOe

7665	7666	Hi @JJosaur. I can only second your answer. Nevertheless, maybe it would be worth adding a more recent meta-analysis published on this topic to your answer? (Pezzoli G et al. Exposure to pesticides or solvents and risk of Parkinson disease. Neurology. 2013 May 28;80(22):2035-41. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318294b3c8.) I think it would be interesting as it basically comes to the same conclusion as the study by Priyadarshi et al while also addressing some of the limitations associated with this study (in particular the heterogeneity of the included trials). Best wishes.	2016-08-04 10:43:24Z	S.Victor
7665	7666	You are welcome. When I saw some of the comments questionning the possible link between PD and pesticides, I thought it might be necessary to bring some additional references... Best wishes.	2016-08-04 10:56:38Z	S.Victor
7665	7666	Thank you JJosaur and @S.Victor for your precious answers and insights. It really helps a lot!	2016-08-04 12:39:12Z	
7645	7649	Im not getting much protein diet everyday. I also cant take any Protein powders in market, since Im allergic to preservative mixed into them.  I eat mostly vegetarian diet, and very less meat. So I though BCAA's are good choice for me.	2016-08-03 07:41:58Z	
7645	7649	And to give you idea about my physic, this is my 6th year to the Gym, I have a very good lean muscular body (177cm height / 75KG weight). But I want to gain mass and more muscles.	2016-08-03 07:43:28Z	
7645	7649	Im a Web Developer by profession	2016-08-03 07:43:59Z	
7645	7649	BCAA's may help your recovery and may help protein synthesis but won't do anything if you don't have enough protein in your diet to begin with. I'm hearing a lot of excuses about your diet, to gain weight you need to eat more calories than you use. To gain lean muscle mass you should have a good macronutrient breakdown in that calorie surplus diet. There are lots of vegetarian protein options out there and taking protein powder is not a "must". (You are the first person I have come across though that is allergic to a protein powder preservative, what is the specific allergy to?)	2016-08-03 07:56:15Z	JJosaur
7645	7649	For someone who prefaces his answer with "I am not a biochemist", this is an excellent answer. You provide a solid explanation of what's really going on under the hood, with plenty of reasonable sources, and even a strong but simple metaphor for other "not a biochemist"s out there. Then you wrap it up with a proposed solution based on all of the above. It's a work of art.	2016-12-02 14:13:11Z	TheEnvironmentalist
7642	7655	So, the answer is most of the times yes. But I'm sorry I did not clarify the question. I'm actually the patient (I don't have 7 years old anymore) but I still have motor symptoms, also the MRI showed damaged areas after two years of the monophasic attack. Is that an indicator that my myelin is still not fully recovered?	2016-08-03 09:42:09Z	
7642	7655	Hi vicaba. Sorry for my late reply. I had a quick talk with a colleague of mine who is neurologist about the remyelination potential in ADEM. Hope this brings some clarifications. Good luck. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-11 12:45:08Z	M. Arrowsmith
7642	7655	Thank you for your interest. The resources you provide have a lot of relevant information to me. I've found several studies targeting remyelination but they have to be tested in humans. Just for the record I'll write them down.  * An inhibitor of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesis promotes central nervous system remyelination * Anti-muscarinic adjunct therapy accelerates functional human oligodendrocyte repair * Vitamin D receptor–retinoid X receptor heterodimer signaling regulates oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation	2016-08-16 15:04:04Z	
7642	7655	Interesting. Thank you. Considering that demyelinating diseases are associated with a significant burden, those remyelinating therapies are really promising. However, as you noted, evidence from trials conducted in humans are still missing but let's hope that this will come soon! Good luck. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-17 08:30:34Z	M. Arrowsmith
8698	8699	Thanks, it makes sense that 60-100 would be considered the "average" range during the day (sitting, doing desktop job, etc), but not really first thing in the morning. I also reduced my RHR to a weakly average of ~60, and even sometimes get morning RHRs of ~55 (especially when well rested). That's after several months of rather light training (some weightlifting, 20 min cardio sessions now and then), healthy eating, reducing my body weight and trying to be more active during the day in general. That's why the whole "bradycardia below 60" idea didn't make much sense.	2016-08-02 13:23:01Z	
8698	8699	Just to add to this answer. Readings at the doctor's office are rarely accurate. A lot of people get nervous because they're at the doctor's office. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_coat_hypertension	2016-08-02 13:30:07Z	
8698	8699	I actually get White Coat Hypertension but it's important to note that Heart Rate and Blood Pressure are very different things.	2016-08-02 13:54:09Z	
8698	8699	+1 @akadian and the reading is never really accurate because most of the time doctors measure just 10 seconds and then extrapolate.	2016-08-03 08:52:24Z	
8698	8699	@Boris - Anyone trained in properly measuring a pulse most certainly can get an accurate reading in 10-15 seconds (15 seconds is the standard) so long as the rhythm is fairly regular. A 15-second sample of a normal, regular heart beat taken by someone with proper training will produce the same number as an ECG or a person taking a full 60-second sample.	2016-08-05 22:27:30Z	Carey Gregory
8698	9342	Thanks! It's just that my wrist HRM gives rather strange results for my RHR, presumably because I tend to snooze a bit after my first alarm. :) I don't see how the clock diffeentiates between lying in bed, awaken, and still sleeping. So the clock will say my RHR is, say, 52, although it will hardly go below 60 during the day (while sitting, for example). So according to the 60-100 rule combined with watch readings, I should be quite fit, although I am far from that (e.g. the clock measured my VO2 max at 44, for a 35 yo male).	2016-09-23 09:58:11Z	
7630	7636	Thanks Carey! All my internet readings in the past 2 months showed up gynecomastia. I did not even know that there was a condition called Pseudogynecomastia..! Hmm...I would need to consult a doctor then. Thanks again!	2016-08-02 15:24:13Z	
7630	7640	Hello JJosaur! Thanks for your advice! I've uploaded the images of my chest. Could you please take a look?	2016-08-02 16:53:24Z	
7630	7640	I'm not a doctor and so can't diagnose you	2016-08-03 05:46:24Z	JJosaur
7625	8782	Thanks @JJosaur.  I used the duct tape to very successfully treat a verucca so thought I'd give it a try with the wart.  I've tried salocyclic acid and also had the doctor try and freeze it off (i asked them to give it the maximum length of spraying, ten seconds IIRC), but it keeps coming back, the bugger.  You're right about sweat making it fall off though.	2016-08-10 12:42:09Z	
7612	7620	Thanks for the explanation; is there any (health or otherwise) reason why copper-bottomed cookware would be more expensive?	2016-08-03 13:39:18Z	
7612	7620	@Joe - No, copper is simply more expensive than aluminum. They're both on the exterior of the pan only so food never touches either one.	2016-08-03 14:03:21Z	Carey Gregory

I do not have the privilege of creating a chatroom. Probably I shall add my thought if somebody with the privilege can create a chatroom linked to this question. I wonder if there is another way to add a longer comment than the limit here.	2017-12-11 05:16:00Z	Ludwig Wittgenstein
7608	14640	1. Thank you for your answer discovering some different aspects of diagnosing Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults. There is no doubt about the issues related to the validity of screening and diagnostic tools for ASD in adults. While any clinical tool can have imperfections related to specificity, sensitivity, predictive values etc., those for ASD in adults may have more such issues due to the relative dearth of quality research into the subject.	2017-12-11 05:20:55Z	Ludwig Wittgenstein
7608	14640	2. The first two research papers you have cited here, viz. Khouszam et al. (2004) and Woodbury-Smith (2005) discussed the validity of the currently available diagnostic and screening tools. However, we need not read them as arguments against the benefits of diagnosing ASD in adults.  The third research paper you have cited here, viz. Moloney (2010) discussed and questioned the effect and impact of diagnosing ASD in adults, which may be considered a critical analysis of the liberal diagnosis or rather labelling people with ASD. It is obviously an important point indeed.	2017-12-11 05:21:57Z	Ludwig Wittgenstein
7608	14640	3. Murphy et al. (2016) reviewed a great deal of published evidence regarding ‘Autism spectrum disorder in adults: diagnosis, management, and health services development’. A systemic review by Jacob et al. (2015) discussed ‘The Costs and Benefits of Employing an Adult with Autism Spectrum Disorder’. Both those publications, as well as many others,  acknowledged that there could be significant benefits of diagnosing ASD across many a perspective even in adults rather than not doing so.	2017-12-11 05:22:59Z	Ludwig Wittgenstein
7608	14640	4. As clinicians, we are interested in the best overall evidence in order to guide our clinical practice. If we carry out a literature review on any topic, we can surely retrieve a myriad of research papers arguing for and against the proposition concerned. How are we going to incorporate a large volume of diverse research work into clinical practice?	2017-12-11 05:23:51Z	Ludwig Wittgenstein
7608	14630	These legal 'benefits'/requirements were completely off my radar. Amazing sense for praxis!	2017-12-10 17:43:34Z	LangLangC

7588	7590	I do appreciate the answer, but it doesn't really address the chief issue. I am well aware of calories in vs. calories out, and all that, but I am specifically trying to address the science (or lack thereof) of meal frequency as it relates to metabolism. Of all the help I've been offered, this is the one thing that has never made sense to me, and I'm really trying to get to the bottom of whether or not there is any validity to it.	2016-07-28 21:00:00Z

7564	7568	Couldn't the bleeding also be a hint that the intercourse is too rough for her?	2016-08-03 06:39:07Z	Marzipanherz
7564	7568	Well, yes, but that is relative - if the cervix is infected, it may bleed even with gentle intercourse. An examination would find any worrisome areas on not only the cervix but anywhere else in the vagina or labia. This could be as simple as a benign exposure of fragile tissue on the cervix (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_ectropion) , to a benign cervical polyp, to vaginal cancer even though that is rare in a young woman.	2016-08-03 16:48:41Z	Harold
7564	7568	@Harold Thanks for the comment. I guess it would improve your answer, I if you'd incorporate the comment.	2016-08-03 22:28:30Z	Marzipanherz
7558	7567	The term "root canal" was confusing for me initially because that's the name of a specific dental procedure. Since the quote uses the word "tubes" I might consider using that instead.	2016-07-27 04:01:10Z	Carey Gregory
7558	7567	so for example, if you have a sensitive edge on your tooth, the flouride in toothpaste can cover up the exposed dentin?	2016-07-27 09:46:32Z	
7558	7567	@CareyGregory I realized that to, thanks for the suggestion. I'll try to edit accordingly.	2016-07-28 01:17:09Z	Pobrecita
7543	7547	Witch's kiss... now there's a new one.	2016-07-25 15:25:24Z	Carey Gregory
7543	7547	If my doctor was talking about the "withces kiss", this question would not exist.	2016-07-25 18:08:01Z	
7543	7547	Interesting article there, though I am not sure if the size of bacteria is "big enough" to experience the forces describe in the article linked. I assume Mate leaf particles or even chalk dust particles are much bigger than a typical bacteria in size.	2016-07-25 18:15:30Z	
7543	7547	The particles they used were 0.5 mm, which is about a thousand times larger than a typical bacterium.	2016-07-25 18:25:00Z	Carey Gregory
7543	7547	With the opposing forces at play the only way they could go up the stream is through fluid forces, hence the physics slant on my answer; bacteria just don't swim that fast.	2016-07-25 18:26:05Z	JJosaur
7540	7548	Sorry to have pulled so much form Wikipedia but it does seem to give the best answer.	2016-07-25 15:39:10Z	JJosaur

7528	7637	Excellent point regarding rivaroxaban, particularly after the recent controversies regarding the ROCKET-AF trial (see BMJ 2016;352:i575). While I do agree with all the strategies you have suggested, you may wish to consider adding opioids as additional strategy (see Ochsner J. 2010 Fall; 10(3): 179–187, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096211) as it is commonly used by geriatrician? BR. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-02 10:51:53Z	M. Arrowsmith
7528	7637	Thanks @M.Arrowsmith. Happy to see that the controversy about ROCKET-AF was not only debated in our (intense) journal club! Anyway, it only confirms real world experience from clinical practice that rivaroxaban leads to at least the same bleeding risk (or even more?) than VKA. But let's wait for an answer from the authors... I have added your suggestion concerning the pain control, thanks for the feedback! You may also notice that I added some more details to my answer as obviously someone downvoted it (without giving a reason for it) Best wishes. S. Victor	2016-08-02 17:15:02Z	S.Victor
7528	7637	Tbh I upvoted your post as it provides a clear message based on current clinical practices (uptodate +1). Well, maybe you need first to see several patients coming to the ED with UGI bleeding after taking ASA and OTC NSAID ("but my doctor never told me to stop the NSAID and anyway, I can buy it in the supermarket so why should it be dangerous?") to be sensible enough to appreciate your answer! Btw I have done some formatting and added some references, maybe this helps. Good luck, BR M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-02 22:15:38Z	M. Arrowsmith
7528	7637	Thanks @M.Arrowsmith for adding some references. Of course, I can only approve your comment regarding NSAID-ASA and upper GI bleeding (+1 from one of our consultant gastroenterologist!). Thanks again for taking the time to improve my answer. All the best for your research. Best wishes.	2016-08-03 09:37:33Z	S.Victor
7522	7561	What do I win for guessing right?  ;-)	2016-07-26 14:39:29Z	Carey Gregory
7522	7561	I'm not sure @CareyGregory, but whoever down voted this loses because it is an answer to the original question.	2016-07-27 15:28:25Z	
7522	7561	I didn't downvote it, but the question is actually off topic and that may be the reason for the downvote. Requests for personal medical advice are considered off topic here, and asking us to identify a skin lesion falls squarely in that category.	2016-07-27 18:29:14Z	Carey Gregory
7522	7561	Gotcha. Thanks for your help @CareyGregory.	2016-07-29 18:27:29Z	
7511	8805	Wow thanks for your time. All the info I need. Convincing.	2016-08-13 12:00:38Z	
7504	7505	Nice article! I will adjust the applied force when brushing. I also might switch to electric brushing	2016-07-22 11:48:24Z	
7504	7505	There is an element that should be added to this answere: On top of brushing lightly with the right techinique, it is important to use soft or ultra-soft bristles. Anything that is not removed with those bristles is better removed with metalic curettes at a dental office, which avoid rubbing off the gums.	2016-08-03 03:56:50Z	enap_mwf
7504	7506	Do you have references to back up your claims?	2016-07-22 21:20:31Z	JohnP

7498	7549	Your last sentence is almost correct. It is plasma, but it's purpose isn't to seal wounds. Now if you could find reliable sources to support that, along with an explanation of why the fluid builds up, and delete your entire first paragraph, you'd have a good answer.	2016-07-25 22:56:33Z	Carey Gregory
7498	7549	Hi, thank you for your post! However, on this site we usually have references for your post. Adding these would give you a good answer. Thank you and see you around the site.	2016-07-26 02:44:09Z	Pobrecita

7486	7489	This doesn't address the question, which concerns why phenmetrazine was banned.	2017-02-17 11:03:06Z	TheEnvironmentalist
7486	7489	@TheEnvironmentalist at some level that is a deeper, unanswerable, question. Staying brief, it was banned because it was abused for the high, primarily in Sweden where it was classified as a narcotic in 1959 druglibrary.org/schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/cu/CU39.html	2017-02-20 07:58:12Z	JJosaur
7486	7489	Mind editing the answer to include the above, and references?	2017-02-20 09:10:36Z	TheEnvironmentalist
7482	7513	My posture is stable and it doesn't pain when I sneeze in any way. You mentioned that drinking a lot of water... What is more in the lines of what I'm experiencing is from the belly to the pelvic. Could it perhaps be that if I'm bloated or have eaten a lot that it puts tension on the muscles by pushing them in an unnatural manner?	2016-07-22 13:31:59Z	
7472	10363	Some references to backup your claims would be great.	2016-12-09 15:48:59Z	kenorb
7470	7523	It would be interesting to see rates broken down by age groups. If your answer is the entire explanation, then pediatric cancer rates would be the same. My bet is they are not. I would expect pedi cancer rates in developed nations to be higher than in undeveloped nations due to lower detection and reporting rates in the undeveloped world.	2016-07-22 18:22:27Z	Carey Gregory
7470	7523	jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00242-4/abstract this study, by Yasmine White et. al., shows that 80-85% of all pediatric cancer cases are in the undeveloped world.	2016-07-22 19:01:57Z	user8669
7470	7523	Wow, surprising numbers. I don't understand why they would be so much higher.	2016-07-22 19:28:27Z	Carey Gregory
7470	7523	I would not expect the incidence to be the same. Children born in developing countries are most likely at much higher risk for cancer because of environmental factors they may be exposed to in utero or by their parents when they are born.	2016-07-22 19:53:41Z	user8669
7470	7523	I wouldn't expect the same either, but I would expect that a much higher detection rate in developed nations would have a much larger effect.	2016-07-22 20:43:03Z	Carey Gregory
7462	7463	So it depends? Damn, I thought it was something like Light injuries are just skin damage, normal injuries are broken bones, heavy injuries are internal damage and lost limbs, critical injuries are multiple lost limbs or other lasting damage.	2016-07-19 07:43:09Z	
7462	7463	It definitely depends.  Remember they are not just describing physical trauma, but strokes, heart attacks, or a whole bunch of other possible acute conditions.  The guidelines I linked are probably the closest you'll find to a description of the meaning of those terms, but a specific hospital may have their own descriptions.	2016-07-19 07:49:47Z	Hans
7454	7457	I am more concerned if i lost any brain cells. There are no bad effects I feel right now but might it have caused loss of brain cells that will affect me later in the future?	2016-07-18 20:12:43Z	
7454	7457	How would you lose brain cells? Your brain is encased in and protected by your skull, and your skull cannot be compressed unless it's compressed so much that it fractures. That is the only way you could have lost brain cells, and as I said, you would know without doubt if you had fractured your skull.	2016-07-18 21:28:41Z	Carey Gregory
7454	7457	You can lose brain cells without fracturing your skull. For example even small bumps can cause loss of brain cells.	2016-07-19 14:55:56Z	
7454	7457	It is true that banging your head hard enough can knock the brain against the side of your skull and cause some level of brain damage, but that has nothing to do with the situation you described of squeezing.  There is no possibility of you having had brain damage from that.	2016-07-19 15:03:04Z	Ed Bayiates
7449	7480	Where do you get "one study"? I linked to a review.  Why do you think that what happens to be a good daily dose is equivalent to what happens to be a good one time dose?	2016-07-20 14:35:43Z	
7449	7480	@Christian, you are correct, it appears to be a review of trials. I did a bit more digging and updated my answer.	2016-07-20 15:34:02Z	JJosaur
7449	7480	The 45mg number is a number for a daily dosage. Why do you think it's relevant for taking zinc as a one-time intervention? Especially given that the studies that show a useful effect from a one time intervention use ≥ 75mg?	2016-07-20 16:56:16Z	
7449	7480	No, 15mg is reccomended daily dosage. Evidently you don't agree with my answer and have made your own assumptions about what the 'correct' answer to your question should be.	2016-07-20 16:58:34Z	JJosaur
7449	7480	Final comment: you assumed from a invalid review that zinc significantly helps the common cold symptoms.	2016-07-20 17:22:40Z	JJosaur
7443	7468	I like your answer, it's very wide-ranging. it just misses the recommended sources. can you quote from articles you are referring to?	2016-07-20 07:41:23Z	Sunny Onesotrue

7429	7431	Thank you for this answer. However, I am just somehow confused, because the OP is asking about "Amyl nitrAte" and not "Amyl nitrIte", which are different substances in my knowledge. Probably this a typing error, but it would be nice if the OP (@Chank) could just clarify this. BR. MA	2016-07-16 11:34:09Z	M. Arrowsmith
7429	7431	@M.Arrowsmith I'm sure the OP meant amyl nitrite, so I edited the question accordingly.	2016-07-16 14:20:25Z	Carey Gregory
7429	7431	@CareyGregory. Ok. Thanks for the feedback. BR. MA	2016-07-16 18:59:30Z	M. Arrowsmith

7401	7415	Never know about difference in lactose maldigestion and lactose intolerance. Thank you for providing a detailed explanation! As suggested by goldengrain I will start trying with small amounts of whole milk to see how my body reacts to it.	2016-07-14 23:55:33Z	
7401	7415	Hi! Actually, one of the points I wanted to emphasize in my answer, is that many people are sometimes confused between lactose maldigestion and lactose intolerance (which is a diagnosis based on diagnostic analysis criterias) and "self-diagnose" lactose intolerance without having undergone the necessary diagnostic investigations. Two papers in the literature have examined this issue (the one I cited in my references, and this one: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8438774). Hope this brings some clarifications. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-17 20:58:16Z	M. Arrowsmith
7373	7386	I found this link - prnewswire.com/news-releases/… - where apparently there is a company working on this. Though, haven't been able to Google up any updates from them so not sure how legit reason for hope that is.	2016-07-15 01:43:54Z	
7373	7386	This is almost a good answer. If you added a citation or two to support your statements it would be a good answer.	2016-07-15 15:03:27Z	Carey Gregory
7373	7386	@CareyGregory - does that satisfy your desire for references?	2016-07-16 14:50:44Z	Jared
7373	7386	It's not my desire; it's the site's desire. But yes, much better. :-)	2016-07-16 17:22:38Z	Carey Gregory
7373	7386	Since health is an important topic, the site has a strict policy that all answers should be backed up with reliable references in order to provide the community with the means to assess the merit of the answer, regardless of the reader's background. @CareyGregory can't really do anything else than request references as this is how the community decided.	2017-04-15 13:18:24Z	Narusan-in-coma
7353	7363	It's worth mentioning that given the normal range of <34 (ie less than 34), a result of <5 (ie less than 5) is within normal range, because any number less than 5 is also less than 34.	2016-07-10 01:42:13Z	Highly Irregular
7353	7363	@HighlyIrregular :-) obviously. Why they did not write less sign on thyreoglobulin  14. It could be <14.	2016-07-10 08:43:37Z	
7347	7356	You make several assertions of fact in this answer. Those assertions need to be supported with reliable sources.	2016-07-09 14:00:00Z	Carey Gregory
7347	7356	I'll update my answer with links. Thanks for the suggestion.	2016-07-09 14:07:32Z	Weezy
7341	7342	For fat-soluble: is it enough with "some fat" (like a glass of milk, or an avocado)? Does an entire meal inhibit absorption of supplements?	2016-07-08 18:55:52Z	
7341	7342	An entire meal would not inhibit absorption.. that's not how it works.. your body doesn't "skip" things because you stuff yourself. A good example is calories... you can't stuff yourself with food, making your body "skip" calories.  Exceptions do exist, such as laxatives.	2016-07-08 19:03:20Z	Othya
7341	7342	This is a good general overview, but there are exceptions.  For example, zinc is a competitive inhibitor of copper absorption, so supplementing both at the same time is counterproductive.	2016-07-09 08:17:42Z	Mark
7333	7334	Who am I to demand she takes a test? I consider it a normal action, regarding the fact that it's a potential problem I'm involved in. Sorry, but that part sounded a little bit feminist. Anyway, thank you for your answer.	2016-07-15 14:21:17Z	
7333	7334	@user334701 There's nothing feminist about it. You can't go around demanding that other people take medical tests, especially not when you have no relationship with her and waited 5 months to give a damn.	2016-07-15 15:01:34Z	Carey Gregory
7333	7334	I actually asked her that at a short time after it happened - ~4-5 months ago.	2016-07-16 00:56:12Z	
7333	7334	@user334701 Whatever. You still can't demand that other people take medical tests to satisfy your worries.	2016-07-16 01:10:57Z	Carey Gregory

7287	7289	L-Thyroxine isn't artificial T3, it is artifical T4. Artifical T3 is liothyronine, which is needed in a (possibly small) subgroup of hypothyroid patients. Although they usually mark hypothyroidism, elevated TSH concentrations may in very rare cases accompany hyperthyroidism (i.e. secondary hyperthyroidism). See the papers ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635726 and ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375554 for reference and methods of differential diagnosis.	2016-07-05 23:30:08Z	jwdietrich

7257	7274	Answers here are expected to be based on science, not personal experience, and should provide sources for the claims they make.	2016-07-02 13:59:36Z	Carey Gregory
7257	7274	If that is so, you should change the text that gets displayed when you first want to add an answer - which explicitly mentions personal experience listed on the same side as references, and "opinions" on the no no side, without any detailing of distinctions.  Don't down-vote me for actually sticking to what the site suggested to me.	2016-07-02 21:02:17Z	user1847129
7257	7274	I don't know what text you're referring to, but the rules of Health.SE are that answers must provide support for assertions of fact or risk downvotes and possible deletion. I didn't make those rules, so arguing with me about it is pointless. Post in meta, show us this conflicting text you referred to, and explain why you think the very nature of the group is wrong and should be changed.	2016-07-02 22:25:42Z	Carey Gregory
7257	7274	As I don't see that text anymore when I try to post a reply, I conclude that it was shown to me as some sort of intro text as I just joined this (sub) site. That intro text then seems out of sync with the rules. But it looks like it's not possible for me to reproduce unless I quit this site and then rejoin. (?)	2016-07-02 23:56:23Z	user1847129

7243	9037	Please, could you add some references to your answer? Here on Health SE we highly recommend using references to support claims. Thanks. BW	2016-08-31 17:44:01Z	S.Victor
7242	14373	Yes, to add. If you view a coronal ct or mri, you can visually see the coral shapes as well. Very pretty and well formed on a scan. It’s unique and hard to miss.	2017-11-16 14:40:15Z	cloudnyn3
7236	11080	The study you found is about chloroprene, not polychloroprene.  There's a big difference in potential carcinogenity: the long-chain molecules of the poly form make it much less reactive.  As an analogy, inhaling powdered sandstone will give you silicosis; trying to inhale a sandstone boulder will just make you look silly.	2017-02-08 01:52:40Z	Mark

7227	7295	Thank you for your answer :) Would the hearing loss be reversed after a successful treatment of TMD?	2016-08-05 08:09:50Z	
7227	7295	I found one study in a patient with TMJ-OA  presenting with ear fullness and temporary hearing loss that showed improvement of the hearing function after extensive therapy (3 months of self-applied physical therapy (stretch and thermal packs), full-arch stabilization splint, trigger point injection, and a TMJ injection using triamcinolone acetonide (20 milligrams)). You can find the study here: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25726347. There might be other studies and it would probably be worth having a thorough search in Pubmed. Best regards. M.

7215	8987	@Carey_Gregory I am sorry, I just forgot. May you consider removing your downvote once I add some sources ?	2016-08-25 06:55:45Z	Stphane
7215	8987	Could you provide references for all your claims individually? Currently you have 2 links to an article with references. For example, if i want to verify that your "honey will surely and quickly raise your blood sugar"-claim there is no link to check it. Also, I highly doubt that by eating any amount of honey (even tiny amounts) would result in "high blood sugar" and "becoming overweight".	2016-08-28 06:39:04Z	Fermi paradox
7215	8987	@Fermiparadox you are right, I added sources. I hope articles will make sense to you.	2016-08-28 20:14:33Z	Stphane
7215	8987	@Stphane This is much better so i reverted my downvote. There is still some room for improvement though. E.g. the comment by Carey.

7209	7210	This is a great website. A Google search turns up no criticism (which doesn't prove anything but it's a data point nevertheless). Harvard even talks about the differences between their advice and USDA's.	2016-06-25 11:56:55Z	
7209	7216	This site doesn't have a good overview of advice (you probably need to buy the book for that...). However, it does scientifically answer a lot of good questions ("if white rice is bad for you, how about Asian diets?").	2016-06-27 09:47:43Z	
7205	9392	I think you misread the question. I don't think OP is asking about devices that literally diagnose, but rather just the terminology of distinguishing between a diagnosis based on machine test results vs. a diagnosis based purely on physical exam and history. (And I don't fully agree that machines don't diagnose. They can and they do, but that's beside the point.)	2016-09-28 04:50:32Z	Carey Gregory

7190	7277	I was sold on your final point until you referenced that abortion of a website. Any website that claims that they have a way to spot-reduce fat on a specific area of your body, e.g. "Intermittent Fasting Can Help You Lose Weight and Belly Fat" is 100%, certified, bullshit.	2016-08-31 06:53:14Z	JJosaur
7190	7277	Irrelevant drivel. The people originally making the claims about the effects of intermittent fasting have studies to back it up. It's not about "a website" or them making perhaps some inaccurate representations about the topic - and then you dismissing all of it because of that? That's what's bullshit. What do you have to dismiss the whole thing? Nothing but hot air. Using html emphasis on some strong words doesn't substitute for substance.	2016-09-08 13:13:03Z	user1847129
7190	7277	Where in your quote is the claim to exclusively reduce fat in a certain area? (which is what you seem to imply) The quote is 100% correct, your text comprehension score is more like 10%. Yes, you can loose belly fat. Someone halfway knowledgeable in nutrition and health would know that "belly fat" is especially important fat with regards to diseases that involve inflammation. So they are obviously emphasizing the most relvant kind of fat and say "yes, you can loose some of that!", as fat on the buttocks is apparently not nearly as unhealthy.	2016-09-08 13:31:13Z	user1847129

7185	9550	Since this question was quite a while ago, I did end up going to see a doctor about it and he did diagnose that it was peripheral neuropathy, and that I definitely did not have diabetes after the blood tests conducted. He prescribed gabapentin and that worked wonders. I do also have potassium supplements which also seem to be helping	2016-10-10 13:03:52Z	
7185	9550	@BrianLeishman, you may want to add this info as an "EDIT" in your question. Also (if you want) - was it related to nutrition?	2016-10-10 13:30:46Z	Jan
7185	9550	I'm not sure if it was actually, since then I've realized that if I just eat regularly that the problem still occurs, so I don't think it was at all related to my diet	2016-10-10 13:33:44Z	
7185	9550	Yeah sorry haha, it's been quite a while since I asked this question and I completely forgot about it since then since it didn't get any attention until just a few days ago	2016-10-10 13:44:01Z	
7185	9550	@Brian It's great that you've got a solution for your problem. Still, this is a rather good answer and it could help other users in the future, you might consider accepting it ;-).	2016-10-21 07:07:10Z	Lucky
7177	7196	Thank you! Not living in the US, the family doctor or even physician situation is different. We have socialized medicine here so brain surgery and heart transplants are the same cost as a checkup but the downside is that you don't have a family doctor so you will see some random doctor who may or may not want to get to the bottom of whatever problem you are having. Mine is most likely not life threatening not imparing my ability to work so not the highest priority. This is when you need to have something specific to go on and push for, hence my original question.	2016-06-25 21:05:28Z	
7177	7196	Oh! And pub/alcohol was just an example where salty food is the only thing available. Caffeine will delay my sleep but once asleep, no problem and no nightmares. Alcohol makes me sleepy and I have not noticed anything. Spicy food is also OK. Some complain about bad sleep but there also I haven't noticed anything. Yesterday was mid summer festival here so pickled herring was almost mandatory and I loooove pickled herring (salty by nature). Drank plenty of water in the warm sun and before bed but sure enough, hostage situation and shootings throughout the night in my dreams :-(	2016-06-25 21:11:27Z

7164	7413	Welcome to health SE :-). A great answer. If you have the time I think it would be even more helpful for the OP and the other users if you edit it to add a reference for the cyanide lethal dose (it is implicitly shown in the reference you provided, by stating it is similar to that of nicotine, but I haven't found the exact number for cyanide there) and if you specified whether it is 50/60 mg/kg or 50/60 mg for an average adult human. Thanks!	2016-07-15 19:55:47Z	Lucky
7154	7607	Source for the inadaptability of human tissue?	2016-08-31 22:12:20Z	
7154	7607	@Adamawesome4 You want me to find evidence that your hypothesis is false? That's not how it works. There are mountains of indisputable evidence that electricity harms animal tissue, and that's more than sufficient to support my position. It's your hypothesis that tissue can adapt to electricity and not be harmed by it, which runs counter to that mountain of evidence. So the burden is on you to find evidence supporting your rather novel hypothesis that defies all that's known about electricity and animal tissue.	2016-09-01 01:17:50Z	Carey Gregory
7154	7607	I know that it takes just a bit to kill the subject, but I wanted to know, over time, can tissue become more suitable for taking slightly larger voltages? Is there no formal research on this yet? I have found sources for why the heart is weak when introduced to even minimal currents, but have found nothing on its adequacy to change to suit electricity.	2016-09-01 19:17:58Z	
7154	7607	@Adamawesome4 No, there is no formal research because it's not a practical question. I don't know why you think it's even possible. If human tissue was a circuit board, an engineer would do one of two things to protect against outside electrical interference: 1) they would add insulation, or 2) they would add grounded shielding to direct the interference away from the circuit. Animal tissue isn't capable of growing either thing, so how would you imagine it could adapt?	2016-09-01 21:30:48Z	Carey Gregory
7150	7153	what if an adult took DTAP again instead of TDAP, would it be less effective?	2016-06-22 06:39:33Z	
7150	7153	This would probably benefit from a different question. But the answer can be found here medscape.com/viewarticle/726330 . But no it wouldn't be less effective it would be more, the dtap is more antigen, the tdap is a booster. They would have a reaction to it, but be vacinated still.	2016-06-22 14:02:23Z	Pobrecita

7133	7193	thank you! I'm just wondering; how did you find that first source?	2016-06-24 02:45:24Z	
7133	7193	Pubmed is a regular source to search for medical journal articles. I just picked the first article that showed this aspect. There are many other references also on this topic. The second reference is, of course, one of the top cited articles from a very high ranking journal.	2016-06-25 18:13:54Z	rncardio
7132	7155	Wow!  I've always been told the opposite: that cheese or yogurt are great to eat with medications in order to buffer the stomach.  But I have discovered that 90%+ of doctors are not nearly as knowledgeable as they think they are.  And of course, that 90% all think they are in the other 10%. ;-)	2016-06-18 22:39:19Z	
7132	7155	@RockPaperLizard Medicines or drugs are a very broad category - if you heard that you should take one sort of medication with food, which can include milk, and then found out that there is another, completely unrelated sort of medication that interacts with milk and becomes ineffective if taken with dairy products you shouldn't conclude that the first doctor is ignorant. The only conclusion you can draw is that there are a lot of different medicines out there and generalisations to encompass the use of all of them are not just imprecise and reckless, but outright dangerous.	2016-06-23 17:25:19Z	Lucky
7132	7155	@Lucky I have had multiple doctors tell me that cheese or yogurt are ideal to take with any medication to buffer the stomach.  It appears that the advice from these doctors is dangerous.	2016-06-23 18:40:11Z	
7125	7162	The linked article is a commented recipe with all sorts of side comments. Looking through it quickly I could not determine which the relevant parts are.  Which passages did you mean to quote?	2016-06-20 07:01:20Z	
7125	7162	I am simply referring to the fact that the recipe states "add 1 ounce of caffeine" which obviously means synthetic caffeine since otherwise it should state add x ounces of kola nut extract. The whole recipe does not mention koka nut at all. Also, the recipe claims quite convincingly that it is based on at least an early version of the coca cola recipe.	2016-06-20 12:01:08Z	Thawn
7125	7162	Thanks.  Do  you have a source for the information that "...up until the late 19th century where cocaine was replaced with caffeine from the kola nut." ?	2016-06-20 12:05:23Z	
7125	7162	Its in the coca cola recipe article on wikipedia. I added a direct link to the relevant section for your convenience.	2016-06-20 12:07:29Z	Thawn
7125	7162	Today Coca-Cola still contains coca-extract (that is de-cocainized), they are the largest customer of legal coca outside South America en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola#Coca_.E2.80.93_cocaine Similarly cola-nut is used in an "original cola" and caffeine just has to be listed separately. Citing a random cola-like ecipe does not rule out what's really in commercial drinks of that type.	2017-09-12 08:30:45Z	LangLangC

7094	7095	I understand that sleeping heart rate varies but I thought perhaps the minimum recorded during the night should be related to the resting heart rate? I'm making the assumption that at some point in the night, the subject is in deep dreamless sleep.	2016-06-13 06:27:56Z	
7094	7095	I am looking for something similar to your 8 bpm drop. Basically, I can measure the minimum heart rate during the night and I hope I can work out the resting rate by adding a certain number or increasing it by a certain percentage. I'm wondering if such research exists, because I can't find anything definitive.	2016-06-13 06:30:28Z	
7094	7095	Of course it exists. You just need to connect with a sleep specialist or specially a cardiologist as they occasionally need to monitor the heart rate up to 24 hour to monitor for some types of arrythmia after a heart attack, etc. Yes it is done.	2016-06-13 06:50:44Z	healthburg
7094	7095	Do you have a reference from a study or something? Thank you	2016-06-13 07:08:19Z	
7094	7095	I'm not sure how you answered this, or even if you did answer it since there is no actual question posed, but -1 for a complete lack of references. Who says a sleeping heart rate is more variable then resting and that sleeping heart rates are decreased by 8 BPM?	2016-06-13 21:00:28Z	Carey Gregory

7070	7077	Are references required for all answers? I read the FAQ on providing answers and didn't see that mentioned. I'd think general medical knowledge and scientific reasoning should count for something. Also, what gives with the recent downvotes on an old answer to an old question with zero upvotes? It gets edited and suddenly my answer is worse than it was for so long before?	2017-08-11 04:06:05Z	Fonebone

7049	7059	This answer seems to address what would be the problem if I used coca-cola as my main source of food. That's interesting but I tend to eat all kinds of stuff, not just drink coca-cola.	2016-06-10 07:59:41Z	
7049	7059	@TomášZato Even if you get just 100 Kcal from coca-cola out of a 2000 Kcal diet this is still 5%, so there will then be a deficit of roughly 5% in your nutrient intake relative to not drinking coke. This will not lead to overt deficiencies, but the human body evolved to take in calories packed with nutrients, in the jungle in the middle of nowhere there is no store where you can buy coca-coca, if you crave sugary foods, you may find some fruit to eat. Our body design assumes that we typically get such nutrient dense foods.	2016-06-10 16:15:29Z	Count Iblis
7049	7409	Is there any reliable source that confirms your suspicious claims? Specifically that "Artificial sugar in it is harmful for the kidneys" (or anything else for that matter) or that "most fizzy drinks contain lead". That fact that you mention reproductive system damage (human primal fear) rather than any other effect of lead poisoning (which are numerous and dependent on each other) suggests that you're a victim of fear-mongering rhetoric and should seek help.	2016-07-14 08:42:58Z

7045	7064	@CareyGregory You shouldn't downvote him for that. He was explaining possible cause for what I claim.	2016-06-10 22:30:13Z	
7045	7064	@TomášZato I believe his explanation is largely incorrect, and since no supporting sources were offered to support the claims he made, that buys a downvote. That's actually a very good reason to downvote.	2016-06-11 01:14:09Z	Carey Gregory
7045	7064	I downvoted because no references to the claims. The links are about general human biology. The second to last paragtaph should link to a reliable book or source or at least something. I can remove my downvote if its improved.	2017-01-12 17:54:44Z	Santropedro

7072	10872	Thanx, but I did not include any commercial references, the reference is United state department of agriculture and the 2 websites are informational. As for the gmo and herbicide there is so many studies about it's drastic negative health effect, that I did not include any studies, but if someone really cares about his health, they will do the research.  I just came to help people not be misguided by "proudly gmo",respectfully not write a essay. People downvoted me but whatever.	2017-01-20 18:41:09Z	HerbalResearcher
7072	10872	The downvote wasn't mine (I always own and explain my downvotes). "Self" seemed like a subscription magazine to me, I couldn't find the relation to USDA (if I'm wrong I apologize). As for the studies, we can't really have that attitude "the readers should do their research" - although I am for well researched questions, readers don't always have the background to understand scientific studies. Please take my comment as a well intended one - my welcome was sincere, I even upvoted on of your other answers. But the reference policy is strict here, please take a look at Health Meta for more info. Tnx	2017-01-21 01:57:59Z	Lucky
7072	10872	Alright,but it's a complete website with tools, the USDA reference is clearly written on every pages. Just press Ctrl+F.  I might not have all the proof of gmo and herbicide related health issues linked,I've seen plenty and it's just so easy to find(and the OP clearly did not do much research before posting a question,and his question was only is it a "nutritionally complete shake" and if there was "related diseases"  I answered the question well to make this product a definite no go,and it does not recquire to understand scientific studies since they are so easy to understand and find.	2017-01-22 04:07:30Z	HerbalResearcher
7072	10872	When a new user posts an answer, especially to a new question, the post pops up in the review queue, so that if the new user needs guidance on site rules and policies the more experienced users can provide it. That's what I did here. It is up to you whether you will follow the rules and up to the community and if necessary the mods how they will respond. Listing an institution's website as a reference is very different from being affiliated with the institution. You can always check on Health Meta if the community agrees.

In every grocery store and health food store, many (if not most) of the vitamins are sold in pills containing more than the recommended minimums.  If this is too detailed for comments, just let me know, and I can write another question.	2016-06-07 07:25:58Z	
7010	7016	@RockPaperLizard You may want to try for another question, however whatever is the DRI is the safe amount. If the bottles sale more, that doesn't stop what the DRI is I would think. I'll write something like that in a later. I'm typing on my phone. I'll also add some cites.	2016-06-07 08:21:26Z	Pobrecita
7010	7016	Thanks. I'll add another question as soon as I have a little time to compose it.  Looking forward to you updates whenever you have time.	2016-06-08 03:52:16Z

7002	7023	Thank you for your very constructive and helpful feedback!  My recommendation above came from personal experience, out of sheer frustration of wanting a better alternative other than snacks, toothpicks, straws or gum -  the recommendations in abundance on internet articles.  Would you recommend I remove my post altogether, since there are no links to corroborate my personal theory?	2016-06-07 20:07:43Z	Ceylon_17
7002	7023	Of course not, I wouldn't think about that yet! Your post has the beginnings of a good post, just needs some references in compliance with site policy. Are you sure you can't find any for mouth exercises?	2016-06-07 20:17:40Z	Pobrecita
7002	7023	OK, good!  When I tried researching alternatives, I wound up with suggestions for those trying to quit smoking (webmd.com) with gum, straws, toothpicks, etc.  Or for people/children with oral defensive/sensory processing disorders (day2dayparenting.com; arktherapeutic.com) who had to be taught not to reject items like feeding spoons, toothbrushes, etc., & foods with different textures.  Other suggestions were to find ways to distract yourself by keeping mind & hands occupied, bringing us back full circle to the initial question posted re avoiding snacking while working at your computer.	2016-06-07 21:35:53Z	Ceylon_17
7002	7023	Actually I have a habit of clenching my teeth/rubbing them against each other, which wears out outer layer of teeth.(not a native speaker here). She said that I shouldn't eat too much snacks(or too often), as this strengthens a habit of rubbing them, and makes them wear out more easily(I'd guess that this would make sense in context of "muscle memory"). So probably stretching my mouth isn't the best way, not to mention that my coworkers would be surprised :)	2016-06-08 00:03:43Z

6998	9213	I am downvoting this answer because it is basically a copy-paste of the allaboutvision.com website.

6991	12813	This is a lot more profound answer than the currently accepted one. However, I would expect you to include references (Community Guidelines) and spelling out the "=>" arrows points you have at the bottom to make it an excellent answer. That would really deepen the understanding of any future readers!	2017-07-03 16:59:15Z	Narusan-in-coma
6988	9334	I think this answers many parts of my question. But does it freeze fat and would that be unhealthy?	2016-09-21 23:48:31Z	
6988	9334	@Bradman175 No, it doesn't freeze fat. It would take a huge amount of ice to accomplish that. Your gut is a very warm environment and anything that enters it cold doesn't stay that way long.	2016-09-22 04:43:38Z	Carey Gregory
6988	9334	@CareyGregory Then what explains when you leave the juice of beef on a plate and after a while, it hardens? How about brainfreeze?	2016-09-22 05:40:28Z	
6988	9334	@Bradman175, in the last paragraph of my answer I mentioned that even freezing cold liquids in the stomach attain the body temperature in minutes. So all the "freezing" potential of water is pretty much lost in the stomach. Digestion of fat occurs further in the small intestine, where your cool water would be just at your body temperature, so it wouldn't really affect it. The second study shows that freezing cold liquids slow down stomach emptying and thus slow down the digestion. So, it is possible that "cool" water slows down it also a bit.	2016-09-22 07:55:52Z	Jan
6988	9334	@Bradman175 Warm that plate to body temperature and that won't happen. As for brain freeze, that's just an expression. Your brain doesn't freeze.	2016-09-22 14:23:02Z	Carey Gregory
6988	7065	The problem with my question is it is hard to find a correct answer, as many people have different opinions. I would probably expect an answer that would have a lot of links to evidences and be pretty long. I will wait for now.	2016-06-10 13:16:41Z	
6988	7065	Man, this is simply basic medical school	2016-06-13 23:03:41Z	Blue_Elephant
6988	7065	So produce an answer with a lot of references, also being very detailed. The thing is, my question asks whether drinking cold water in the long run would have any negative effects. I know most people would say no because they like drinking cold water but is that really the case?	2016-06-13 23:46:36Z	
6988	7065	@Bradman175 Considering the warm welcome I've got into this site (significant number of downvotes for medically significant questions) I am far from gently willing to write any answer, nor take time to search for any references	2016-06-14 08:42:56Z	Blue_Elephant
6988	7065	You could also delete your answers that are downvoted to get your reputation back. That also helps the question asker (aka OP) as the question looks more appealing being unanswered.	2016-06-14 13:29:33Z	
6988	7083	Why downvoting with no reason explained?	2016-06-13 09:30:02Z	Phate01
6988	7083	I didn't down vote, but maybe look at my comment in the other answer.	2016-06-13 14:55:25Z	
5983	5984	But assuming I am pre diabetic, would the use of this oil knock me out of ketosis? And thank you for the informative read.	2016-06-04 09:14:37Z	
5983	5984	@RoSiv Yo should then stick to the official health advice, while this does call for lowering carb intake, it's not a ketogenic diet. Note that exercise will help a lot but to be able to exercise well you do need to burn carbs. Energy from carbs requires less oxygen to be burned. On an extremely low carb, high fat diet, you'll struggle with doing strenuous exercise.	2016-06-04 17:42:43Z	Count Iblis

5976	5982	The question "Why would it be necessary to prescribe a brand name medication if a generic version is available?" is that something that research, links or resources can really completely verify?

5969	5971	@FrankKusters accurately checking the sound level of headphones with a "dB meter" is non trivial are requires a coupler that matches the acoustic impedance of the ear.	2016-10-12 01:58:16Z	StrongBad

5967	5968	Alright I understand that salt is bad for health. But is the sodium content directly related to salt? I thought it was an indicator of preservatives as ready made foods have high sodium.	2016-05-31 20:49:56Z	
5967	5968	-1 for "salt is extremely bad for the body". Sodium is essential for body functioning.	2016-06-02 09:57:12Z	rumtscho
5967	5968	@rumtscho I've changed the text to put this issue in the proper context. While sodium is indeed essential, this is irrelevant to the sodium in our diet as it is present in excessive quantities, so much so that even a salt restricted diet will contain so much salt that it will still do harm.	2016-06-02 19:58:55Z	Count Iblis
5967	5968	"Normal" salt intake ----> "normal" blood pressure ----> "normal" elevated blood pressure when aging ----> "normal" diseases like heart attacks and strokes. youtube.com/watch?v=whhUycC71X0	2016-06-02 20:12:09Z	Count Iblis
5967	5968	@JJosaur No, not true at all. High salt intake causes water retention, which increases blood volume and therefore blood pressure. Young, healthy people can get away with that, but as they age their arteries become stiffer, less elastic, and less able to adapt to the increased blood volume. Hence, hypertension develops.	2016-09-01 22:05:48Z	Carey Gregory

5951	11685	Jon, welcome to health SE :-). You gave very solid information, but the answer would be even better if it directly addressed the OP's question, i.e. the link between topical use and a systemic adverse effect to the teeth. I have no objection to your choice of references, but for future answers you can google the name of the substance and "SPC" to get a summary of product characteristics - an openly available, reliable document which is a source of many valuable information regarding medication.

5899	7440	Thank you for your answer!  If I'm understanding you correctly: The heart is such a durable organ that it takes a severe disruption to produce asystole, and those disruptions can't simply be overridden by even a complex sequence of artificial electrical stimulii?  I am guessing this is because asystole only occurs if the muscle itself is impaired -- e.g., via heart attack?	2016-07-23 21:34:47Z	
5899	7440	@Lysander Yes, the answer is that use of electrical current is only beneficial under certain circumstances in cardiac arrest, for example in an arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation. In some cases only a forced brutal attempt will restore the mechanical function of the heart, fast enough to be beneficial for the patient, that is mechanical compressions.	2016-07-24 13:25:53Z	Prodromos Regalides

5876	5889	Ken, There was no big break other than a chip. My tooth is almost completely healed and crown on front tooth just doesn't seem right to me. Perhaps it's time for a different dentist lol	2016-05-23 00:38:05Z	
5874	5883	Thanks -- your answer prompted this related question to which I'd love to get your response.  One other point of clarification: So will you practically never find a MED without an ECG?  I.e., if you're "in the field" and find a subject in VT then you can't distinguish it from asystole without an ECG, correct?  I guess now you're more likely to have AEDs.  But based on your answer it sounds like a MED should never be used without an ECG to determine that it is warranted.	2016-05-22 14:20:18Z	
5874	5883	@Lysander I don't think a MED has ever been made that wasn't combined with an ECG as a single machine. So yeah, you'd never use one without the other.	2016-06-01 05:10:17Z	Carey Gregory
5861	10413	So basically the granules and the tablet are the same thing. The granules just dissolve quicker, having more surface area, and the pill dissolves more slowly for the longer effect. Thanks for the answer mate.	2017-01-06 19:37:32Z

5840	5846	Well, my tooth is hardening up and it's been two weeks so far. I am taking Penicillin for infections. I can sorta feel this throbbing (no pain) in my tooth as if blood is flowing to it. I don't think my tooth will suffer from necrosis. I was quoted 3k and my insurance only covers 1k. What's the outcome if I let it heal by its self completely? Will it decay and die?	2016-05-18 14:54:10Z	
5840	5846	@Programmer23 Problem is, the external part of your tooth is maybe healing itself, but the interior part is certainly dying, since it is not connected to your body anymore. If you didn't take antibiotics, you would maybe have already had an infection spot at the root. Ask your dentist. You can just try to make a call. To my opinion, no alternative to canal. About crown, you can certainly ask for cheaper alternative, like a metallic one...	2016-05-18 16:34:13Z	Blue_Elephant
5840	5846	Well, technically it is connected to my body since it was re-attached and my body didn't reject it. Dentist said he liked what he was seeing and it was healing.	2016-05-18 20:39:48Z	
5840	5846	-1 for practicing dentistry without a license and without having examined the patient.	2016-06-17 15:01:10Z	Carey Gregory
5840	5846	@CareyGregory 1. I did not practice dentistry (?) on what you call patient 2. I made only suggestions 3. I am quite aware of dentistry actually, certainly more than you do	2016-06-17 15:06:54Z	Blue_Elephant
5838	5850	Lucas, welcome to Health.SE!  We hope you like the place and decide to stick around.	2016-05-22 20:50:39Z	
5838	5850	OK, fine; it sounds from what you're saying like it's not hazardous to drive three hours after taking 1 mg of melatonin, and this is good to know. I also just looked at Figure 1 of an article entitled "Measuring Melatonin in Humans", and it looks like it's normal and natural to have relatively high concentrations of melatonin in the blood even in the wee hours of the morning.	2016-05-22 20:51:00Z	
5838	5850	But something's still nagging me. Melatonin is a hormone, and Dr. Breus wrote (see my question) that melatonin "is a sleep and body clock regulator, not a sleep initiator." Hormones are powerful substances which may have short-term or long-term side effects which we're unaware of. Does it really make sense to swallow hormones to help deal with these awakenings? See also the postscript which I just added to the bottom of my question.	2016-05-22 20:51:10Z	
5826	7500	Can you add references to back up your assertions?	2016-07-22 21:22:19Z	JohnP
5826	7500	Hi @user5284 , sorry, but I can't accept this answer as in its current state it doesn't really answer the question.	2016-07-24 02:12:11Z	
5825	5839	Can you provide some references backing up your assertion? It also might help if you specified HOW the burn is to be cooled, and what first aid steps will help rather than hinder future healing.	2016-05-17 23:35:59Z	JohnP
5825	5839	Welcome to Health.SE, and thank you for your answer!  We hope you'll like the place and decide to stay.  Do please edit and add to it, if you have time, as @JohnP suggested.	2016-05-17 23:49:24Z	unforgettableid
5825	5839	Thanks for your answer. I am interested in how cooling helps though, as in why it matters for the damaged cells to be cooled down more/longer.	2016-05-18 01:41:39Z	
5825	5839	@SebastiaanvandenBroek Because thermal injury to cells is a function of two factors: temperature and time. For example, we know a very hot surface will injure tissue with just a brief touch, but a warm surface that you can touch without burning yourself can still cause burns if it's against your skin long enough. Heating pads are a good example of this, which is why they all carry warnings not to fall asleep with them. So the longer burned tissue remains hot, the deeper the heat can penetrate and cause more tissue damage.	2016-07-18 21:39:20Z	Carey Gregory
5818	5842	And so are they alternative medicine practitioners or not? I don't see a clear answer to that question in your otherwise good answer.	2016-05-20 00:48:51Z	Carey Gregory
5818	5849	I honestly can't tell what your answer to the question is.	2016-05-19 03:59:56Z	Carey Gregory
5818	5849	@CareyGregory I tried to explain why nutrition does not fit in well within the "evidence based medicine" paradigm which then explains why you get these disputes about it being or not being "alternative medicine".	2016-05-19 06:41:57Z	Count Iblis
5818	5849	@CountIblis:  So your post is really more of a long comment than an answer?  :)	2016-05-19 20:57:55Z	unforgettableid
5818	5849	But the question wasn't why it fits in well or not. The question was is it or is it not, and I don't think you answered that question.	2016-05-20 00:45:28Z	Carey Gregory
5818	5849	It is wrong to assume that an answer to a question should come down to saying "yes" or "no". An answer should give the OP some relevant information to address the non-trivial issues raised by the question. To get a "yes" or "no" result you could just stick to some definition of alternative medicine and see if nutrition fits that or use some official source that makes a definite statement on that. That's a trivial exercise and not all that illuminating, I don't think the OP would be interested in such an answer.	2016-05-20 20:00:14Z	Count Iblis
5816	10283	That is sensational answer. I believed that there is an optimum but you say that eating less and less and less is always better and better and better. Does it mean that eating nothing will bring to at max of the memory performance?	2016-11-29 09:21:30Z	Little Alien
5816	10283	No, what i was trying to portray is that eating less(that is, taking in less calories) actually improves brain performance. On the other hand, eating nothing(equivalent to no calorie intake) cannot maximize memory performance. Hope you understand now.	2016-11-29 10:09:52Z	Prince
5816	10283	Unbroken deals with starvation conditions, and general malnutrition, which has been shown to cause several cognitive imparements (just one example). CREB1 is also not the end-all-be-all of memory. Much of the reduction of caloric intake benefits (which seem real in the correct conditions) start from adults who have lived in an abundance of nutrition previously (a relatively new phenomenon). Also "memory-boosting pill" needs so many qualifications, that it's probably misleading.	2016-11-29 17:10:23Z	Atl LED
5816	10283	@Prince I understand now that you are completely sick. Probably your memory is perfect but logic is zero. How much do you eat to produce such nonsense?	2016-11-30 09:21:50Z	Little Alien
5816	10283	To what extent does this effect memory? Or was the study unable to say for sure?	2016-11-30 19:12:23Z	
5804	5807	If the lab takes more than 30 days to give you the results, please report an infraction of the HIPAA requirements	2016-05-13 21:59:52Z	Franck Dernoncourt
5804	5807	Franck, thanks much for the regulatory framework reference.  Hopefully, this won't be needed.  I understand Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp typically complete their blood test analysis within just a few days.  They conduct those on behalf of the mentioned online blood test service intermediaries.  Also, I think Theranos is pushing around the industry in a good way by making their tests readily available.  Unfortunately, their geographical coverage is minimal so far.	2016-05-14 00:08:31Z	
5804	5807	+1 for making me aware of this. And you really should accept this answer.	2017-12-21 23:55:15Z	Carey Gregory

5779	5781	Your sources support your assertions about protein being essential, which I'm sure no one disputes anyway, but they don't support your assertion that protein shakes don't cause acne. There is evidence that in fact they do. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22988649	2016-05-10 22:51:56Z	Carey Gregory
5779	5781	@CareyGregory 5 teenagers don't make a study. In statistics, we have the idea of statistical significance, basically, the likelihood that results were caused by a real effect instead of just random chance. With only 5 participants, it's a case study, not a controlled study, and it says as much within the reference itself.	2016-05-10 23:11:28Z	TheEnvironmentalist
5779	5781	I understand all that. I merely grabbed the first reliable source that indicates your assertion that whey has no connection to acne may not be the given you think it is. I ignored dozens and dozens of other sites making the same claim that it does indeed have a connection. The point being you need to support that assertion. It's not a given.	2016-05-11 01:19:58Z	Carey Gregory
5779	5781	That study is barely useful, not only was the study group small but those studied were not done so in a scientifically rigorous way that could mean that a causation could be asserted. Teenagers are more susceptible to acne because hormones and (usually) poor hygiene.	2016-08-09 09:38:15Z	JJosaur
5779	5781	+1 Just because it is in powdered form does not make it suddenly bad for you (assuming you check your protein powder on labdoor before buying it).	2016-09-08 07:03:35Z	JJosaur
5777	5778	Its may be good to add that transmission can also occur through semen and blood exposures. If someone sneezed into their hand or blew their nose that would also facilitate risk.	2016-05-10 19:44:02Z	Pobrecita
5777	5778	@Pobrecita I figured that avoiding saliva implied avoiding more intimate body fluids, but you have a point about blood exposure so I edited to include that.	2016-05-10 19:49:52Z	Carey Gregory
5777	5778	Awesome 1+! Its much clearly stated to me, and I can see how it was being implied, however not all people are the same medical level and so its best to state it all flat out :)	2016-05-10 19:54:26Z	Pobrecita
5762	5796	Full power the LED produces 70 mW, however I am using a variable resistor to tone it down quite considerably. The plan now is to use fiber optics to diffuse the light source evenly, hopefully getting better results and reducing the amount of direct light hitting the eye.	2016-05-12 12:50:19Z	
5762	5796	a 50mW laser can light a match. Be very careful, cause exposure to such power might produce too much heat.	2016-05-12 15:30:23Z	user2361

5643	5647	Hi, Jan, it is obvious that you put a lot of effort in this answer and cited a lot of references in an attempt to help the OP :-). Nonetheless, personal medical advice is strictly off-topic, and making exceptions might cause chaos on the website. What's more, the OP might interpret "does not likely arise from" as "I'm fine and can skip a visit to the doctor's" and in some cases it might harm them.	2016-04-28 03:18:47Z	Lucky
5643	5647	My suggestion: Whenever either the question or answer is "offtopic" or inappropriate according to the admin/moderators, delete it. If my answer "might harm them" why is it then still online and everyone can read it?	2016-05-17 07:19:39Z	Jan

When we read the school reading book three or four times, she remembers the sentences so she gets them right in the end. She still gets small words wrong. she doesn't even say a word with the same first letter! i.e. for "are" she will be adamant it is "we" and even sound it out with a "w"  It's hard not to get frustrated sometimes. I cover all but the first letter and she gets the word then. ...>	2017-04-14 13:06:52Z	
5635	7346	...> But i'm always proud, supportive and I always commend her efforts and I think that helps. She will read some sentences first time and quickly too, as if she has no problem, and that always makes me happy. But repetition and support is the key I think.	2017-04-14 13:09:37Z	
5626	5628	Thank you so much for sharing. Costochondritis does sound like what I may be experiencing specifically for the chest pain, I'll consult with my primary doctor on that one.	2016-04-25 20:39:38Z	
5619	5624	@wingedpanther Glad it could help :)	2016-04-25 17:34:32Z	Pobrecita
5619	5624	I see nothing in your answer that supports the notion that water turns hair gray, chlorine or not. Damage it, yes, but turn it gray? No.	2016-04-26 02:10:03Z	Carey Gregory
5619	5624	@CareyGregory Thanks for your input on my post, however, I thought that I explained it here: " The reaction of melanin pigments with chlorine results in change of hair from natural colour (blond to black) to straw colour of keratin". Is that not enough, as the question is asking for a remedy not pathophysiology and prevention. Even though I did add those both to cover all facets :)	2016-04-26 03:25:46Z	Pobrecita
5619	5624	No, I didn't find your argument compelling that city water with its tiny quantities of chlorine is responsible for turning hair gray. If that were true, there would be a distinct difference in graying between rural and city dwellers, and I don't think there is. I've seen what daily swimming for weeks on end in heavily chlorinated pools will do to light colored hair (turns it green), but I don't think it turns hair gray, and certainly not in the quantities used in drinking water.	2016-04-26 05:34:26Z	Carey Gregory
5619	5624	@CareyGregory That is not what I meant xD Ok, I'll try to make it a little more clearer then so everyone can understand. Thanks!	2016-04-26 05:57:47Z	Pobrecita
5616	5618	But why is height directly related to leg length?	2016-04-26 01:43:26Z	
5616	5618	Because leg length is related to total height, though the percentage contributed varies according to racial group as explained in the quote.	2016-04-26 01:55:50Z	Graham Chiu
5616	5618	But what is the actual physical reason?	2016-04-26 01:56:01Z	
5616	5618	I mean, is it just trunk length? Is that what you meant?	2016-04-26 02:06:28Z	
5616	5618	It means people with short legs are generally shorter in height, and people with longer legs are taller, everything being in proportion. It's just natural human design.	2016-04-26 15:45:28Z	JohnP
5611	5636	Welcome to health SE :-) While you have provided some references, most of your claims are not substantiated by them. The statement that using toothpaste at all is bad for health is a very strong one and calls for a reference. Besides, your first reference is about fluoride in water, which is very different from fluoride in toothpaste (because toxicity largely depends on doses, and we ingest much more water than tooth paste). Also, if you recommend an alternative to conventional oral hygiene, you should provide references for that as well. Personal experience doesn't cut it.	2016-04-27 03:15:59Z	Lucky
5611	5636	This answer goes against the majority of recommendations by dental experts. It ignores the marked difference between fluoride amounts in toothpaste and the level needed for toxicity. It recommends practises with noteworthy potential for negative outcomes.	2016-06-30 14:16:32Z	Nij
5604	5605	Thanks. But your penultimate paragraph raises an immediate question: Why does not the body then reduce oil production?	2016-04-25 03:39:11Z	
5604	5605	Would you please respond in your answer, which is easier to read than comments?	2016-04-25 03:39:31Z	
5604	5605	@LePressentiment I think he already answered your question: The reproductive advantage of male hormones outweighs the disadvantage of acne. Therefore, there is no selective pressure for the body to reduce oil production.	2016-04-26 04:13:30Z	Carey Gregory
5604	5605	@LePressentiment The simple answer: because it doesn't know it should. These types of responses are trained through evolution. A similar example would be that many venoms are lethal if and only if they spread throughout the bloodstream. A number of chemicals produced by the body, known as vasoconstrictors, are used in certain cases (like when the body is at risk of hypothermia) to restrict blood flow in certain areas. Why, then, doesn't the body naturally restrict blood flow after snake bites in the bitten areas? Because there was never enough evolutionary pressure to develop this reaction.	2016-04-26 04:48:33Z	TheEnvironmentalist
5596	5599	I've never smoked and have always exercised. What bothers me is my sleep. If I suffered from sleeping disorders during my childhood (I've always slept quite late) and at age of 15 used to wake up in the middle of every night and couldn't get back to sleep, is that a reason to worry? Or does the body "make up" for that lost sleep? I don't want to think that I didn't get my full potential height. I'm also regretting not taking GH   injections during childhood.

5583	10364	Welcome to health SE :-). Stackexchange network operates somewhat differently than a forum, it is intended to be a knowledge base. This is why reliable references are required, especially on Health. You can always edit your answer to add some. For more information on how the site works, please take our tour or visit the help center. Thanks!	2016-12-06 20:05:31Z	Lucky
5583	8808	I know that this might seem like common sense/general knowledge, but if we insist on references we have to do so for all answers, especially for the part where you have a quantitative recommendation - it should be fairly easy to add references for this one.	2016-12-06 20:00:30Z	Lucky

5576	5588	Hi, welcome to Stack Exchange and thank you for the post. However, your post lacks suport. links and research supporting your post are usually indicated on the site. Thanks.	2016-04-23 00:41:06Z	Pobrecita
5576	5588	Some cancer treatments induce apoptosis.  But as you say, it depends on tumor doubling time.	2016-04-23 05:20:54Z	Graham Chiu
5576	5588	@Pobrecita Understood, which statements do you want me to back up? This is very basic, general knowledge, which I think doesn't need peer reviewed documentation.	2016-04-23 12:36:43Z	Coma
5576	5588	This is very basic, general knowledge, which I think doesn't need peer reviewed documentation. -- This is a long standing debate here. More knowledgeable participants tend to agree with you that well-established, general knowledge doesn't need to be cited. However, the Powers That Be have established a more rigorous standard that requires virtually all assertions of fact to be cited, even when they're widely-accepted knowledge. Some, like yourself, probably find this standard tedious. Feel free to visit the meta forum and argue your case but others before you have already lost that argument.	2016-04-23 15:35:02Z	Carey Gregory
5576	5588	1+ I think. The links you added seem to help support what you wrote. Which is why links are generally added, to add support to your works.	2016-04-25 23:37:11Z	Pobrecita
5564	5574	Thanks for the good links! I'm surprised at how contradictory the studies are.  In the Amazon article, the company claims: “More doctors and pharmacists recommended Mederma than any other brand for older and newer scars"	2016-04-23 00:14:13Z	
5564	5574	@Scientist256 A lot of stuff says that, but unless you have studies and people to support that that's true. It means nothing.	2016-04-23 00:39:30Z	Pobrecita
5564	5574	It's surprising what companies can claim for over-the-counter medications like Mederma. The FDA should try to regulate this more. @Pobrecita	2016-06-30 05:23:49Z

5536	5546	I removed that weak reference. It originated from a dentist called Weston Price. His work it not regarded as very reliable, but still probably worth reading if you also read the criticisms of it, and come to your own conclusion.	2016-04-28 08:32:19Z	Nick Collier
5536	5546	@NickCollier Thanks for your post, I see you edited your post however now it has no references. Finding reliable sources would be appreciated as it helps support your statement. Good luck. See the help center or ask here for any questions.	2016-04-28 18:25:35Z	Pobrecita
5536	5546	@Pobrecita I can delete it if you like. I am new here so just getting used to what is appropriate to write. I don't have any reliable sources at the moment	2016-04-28 18:29:07Z	Nick Collier
5536	5546	I am not going to tell you to delete your post and I apologize if I came across mean. However, post with reliable sources are preferred here and that is what prompted all the messages. It is not exactly a rush to find the sources and I realize that you are new to Stack Exchange.

5533	5553	Welcome to health SE :-). Here reliable references are strongly encouraged because heath is a sensitive matter, and the OP as well as other users need a way to verify the validity of an answer. You can always edit your question to add references. Thanks!	2016-04-21 01:08:27Z	Lucky
5533	5535	Thanks for pointing that out. I am under a Doctor's supervision, so proper lab blood tests are a part of all this, and my use of the finger prick test is more for spotting trends rather than analysing the specific results. As for the meter itself, I have done back-to-back tests with consistent results (e.g. the above mentioned 108 and 109) so the lower results 20-25 minutes later seem to be a consistent trend (barring coincidence). Your answer about drinking water does answer half of this question though. Thanks again.	2016-04-19 11:18:58Z

5528	5529	I understand that, I was asking about the two-dose schedule and why only the UK approves it for young children.	2016-04-19 01:19:54Z	
5528	5529	Cost benefit analyses, and politicians have stopped it so far. But it's been looked at to bring the UK in line with other countries.  pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical/immunisation/…	2016-04-19 01:39:56Z	Graham Chiu
5528	5529	I'm also not sure how this fully answers the question - which is essentially about why the two-dose schedule is only approved for children 11 years and older by the CDC, as I understand it. If this has changed, maybe you could make this clearer in your second paragraph?	2016-04-20 15:08:21Z	YviDe

5501	8858	Hi! I do agree with your answer. However, I do think that you should provide references (indicating that you are a PharmD candidate isn't sufficient. There are a lot of MD providing answers on Health SE and they still provide references to support their claims). Also, it would be worth giving the compound name of the drugs and not the market name which can change from one country to another. Thank you. Best wishes.	2016-08-23 18:05:15Z	S.Victor

5489	12842	Thank you Narusan. :O) ... All the 'Frontiers' journals are open source, so you can read the full article using the doi links. The other two articles contain the abstracts on the the linked-to page (doi link). If you cannot access any of these websites, please let me know why, i.e., what kind of error message do you receive? Or what else blocks access for you?	2017-07-05 20:29:28Z	Mark D Worthen PsyD
5489	12842	The links work now, I have access to all abstracts. Don't ask me what went wrong previously.... It would be great if you could summarise the findings of tue studies though. That would make this answer outstanding.	2017-07-05 21:20:52Z	Narusan-in-coma

5407	5422	@Franck I'm aware of that issue, but I still like to inform the users new to healthSE that the policy on references is somewhat different here than on other SE sites. In most cases it works well because it's well intended. The backup of the answer is a good idea, but I think that the edit is a great improvement and will prevent the answer from being deleted. However, since it was generously edited by you, I can't give my +1 to this answer, but I hope your edit will serve as a good example for the future :-).	2016-04-10 18:21:41Z	Lucky

5394	5409	I will add more when I am not on mobile, but 3500 cals=1 lb is not really borne out by science. It is more misapplied math from a late 1950's paper than anything. It also varies from person to person.	2016-04-09 13:55:20Z	JohnP

5337	5349	Aging is much more than just shortening of the telomeres, though it is implicated as one of the main causes. Shortening of the telomeres is not "damaged DNA" in it of itself. It is less protected DNA more susceptible to damage. This along with degrading/mutating mitochondrial DNA, build up of metabolites in the cell, mutations over a life-time, and many other factors add up to what we conventionally call "aging". Though you are right in that aging is cells failing at their given function the explanation behind why we age needs better description.	2016-04-05 14:43:11Z	FrankyG
5337	5349	I said that the shortening of telomeres leads to DNA damage, not shortening = DNA damage. It seems to me you're just nitpicking, yes I could have described it in more detail and use stricter language, but for such a general question it's really unnecessary and doesn't really contribute - I don't think you need to go into semantics. But thanks for the better wording anyway.	2016-04-05 14:56:56Z	Coma
5337	5349	The only issue I had was really this part "telomeres shrinking with each cell division, therefore degrading information in our DNA" because that's not what happens. It doesn't degrade, it's more vulnerable. You can call me nit picky but this (and biology sub) are very much that way. I've had my fair share done to me as well. It's not me being mean to you.	2016-04-05 16:25:58Z	FrankyG
5337	5349	Fair enough, my poor wording can make someone misunderstand what's actually happening. Thanks for the correction. I've edited my answer.	2016-04-05 20:12:40Z	Coma

5309	5443	I think you'll find I was downvoted as well, but I'm not in the mood for writing an essay on this. I mostly use the Natural Medicines database through a school subscription so I can't just link the hayfever page from that.	2016-04-11 20:31:59Z	Ben Cannon
5309	5443	One small study showed no difference between local honey, national honey, and corn syrup. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11868925 It's possible that either of these three coating the throat would provide relief from some symptoms.

5309	5443	@BenCannon Yeah, I'm familiar with that article, but I view it with a grain of salt. It was a very small sample and there don't seem to be any better ones. Failure to find an effect in one small study offers very little confidence, especially in the face of a mountain of anecdotal evidence to the contrary.	2016-04-11 21:22:29Z	Carey Gregory

5307	5310	You've got the substance of a good answer here but it's what's known as a link-only answer. If those links every go dead (and don't think they can't just because it's a government web site), your answer becomes worthless. Simply quoting the relevant conclusions from the studies along with the links would guarantee that your answer retains value no matter what the web site does.	2016-04-02 00:14:59Z	Carey Gregory

5307	5310	Thanks for Clearing my doubts but still in little confusion as examiner.com says its lackluster, what do you think it's worth trying or side effects are more weighted over benefits ?	2016-04-02 06:10:38Z	
5304	13558	Does this mean that treatment using Risperidone or other anti psychotics over a period of, say 10 years will cause prolactin / testosterone disturbance to last - or is this a reversible process?	2017-09-08 09:07:48Z	
5304	13558	The elevated prolactin levels return to the normal after the medication is stopped. So yes, the prolactin disturbance is reversible.	2017-09-08 09:11:59Z	
5304	13558	Please remember that I am just going off what I have read. I would strongly recommend that you consult your doctor before making any decisions based on this information	2017-09-08 09:48:35Z	
5304	13558	@R.K. I'm from Germany, and my GP does not encourage me to take any antibiotics and tends not to subscribe anything. This is more likely a problem with your doctor than Germany in general.	2017-09-08 19:02:05Z	Narusan-in-coma
5304	13558	Just my 2 cents, not all SSRIs have the same effects, either.  There are many and each has slightly different side effect profiles with respect to sexual dysfunction as well as fatigue, insomnia, weight gain, etc.  There are ways to optimize but may take multiple tries - WITH a physician, not on your own - to determine the optimal condition management benefit/side effect balance.	2017-09-10 00:46:54Z	DoctorWhom
5303	5306	Hi, I have some follow-up questions:  (1) If the probability of damaging the drawn RBCs is greater with Higher guage needles, then why are they used to draw blood for blood tests? Aren't RBCs checked during blood tests?  (2) If Vitamin E cream is applied before the blood tests, won't it's effect be nullified when the Phlebotomist applies the disinfectant before drawing my blood? Is there any time prescription that it should be applied this many minutes before donating blood so that it may be fully effective?  (3) Doesn't a regular hair oil (such as almond) also have Vitamin E?	2016-04-02 16:21:03Z	
5303	5306	Hi @beck2ham Sorry for the late reply, but thesequestions would be to much to answer in the comments and would probably benefit from a separate answer. Thank you!	2016-06-09 05:10:51Z	Pobrecita
5303	5306	I will try to add some of this to my answer though. Such as #1.	2016-06-09 05:13:58Z	Pobrecita
5298	5299	my x ray is perfect and doctor also agrees with the x ray,he is a very good doctor and i trust him, i have already seen 2 doctors before they didn't say anything about meniscus tear,they told it is a muscle strain and gave me bonsalic but it didn't work.and my motion  is not restricted,only pain and inflammation.is glucosamine a pain killer?	2016-03-31 16:45:11Z	
5298	5299	Can you add sources to support your assertions?	2016-03-31 23:56:04Z	JohnP
5298	5299	sir,which assertions?	2016-04-01 03:37:16Z	
5298	5299	glucosamine  is not a pain killer :-) it just increases the synovial fluid amount and ease the pain in the joints. If you do not have any restrictions then you don't have a meniscus tear. If he is a very good doctor and you trust him do whatever he says do not search for an answer in the google.	2016-04-01 08:31:44Z	bantandor
5298	5299	@bantandor Glucasomine Sulfate has been shown to kill pain just not as quickly as NSAIDs.	2016-04-01 14:06:02Z	FrankyG
5295	5335	Why would exercise make him feel "lack of energy" can you elaborate of this false information ?	2016-04-04 08:48:53Z	Hakim
5295	5335	@Hakim Overweight people will often already get that feeling when reducing calorie intake before doing any exercise. They feel hungry and if they ignore that feeling then hunger becomes tiredness. This is why they find it so difficult to eat less and get more exercise. This will of course be different for different people, but then the people for whom this effect is less of a problem will find it easier to lose weight, so from the group of people who try to lose weight you are going to end up with people who struggle because of this reason.	2016-04-04 15:57:23Z	Count Iblis
5295	5335	@CountIblis - Even though the question is locked, existing answer still need to conform to site standards. Please add appropriate links supporting your assertions, or your answer may be deleted.	2016-04-04 17:44:52Z	JohnP
5295	5335	@JohnP I included a link to how to communicate effectively with a doctor, as that's what the question fundamentally is about, or at least the way we can address this here (no medical advice but instead pointing out that one should seek medical advice).	2016-04-05 16:37:51Z	Count Iblis
5292	5294	All carbonated drinks (with CO2) are mildly acidic since dissolved CO2 creates H+ and HCO3- ions.	2016-04-01 04:35:20Z	Jim Garrison
5292	5294	I never said they had "no acidity" I said they do not have "high amounts of acidic compounds" and thus are not all harmful for your tooth enamel. So it's not true that all carbonated drinks should be avoided to protect enamel. I really should of said "acidic ions" but I think people will understand.	2016-04-01 13:18:22Z	FrankyG
5288	5312	Why? Who says those things will help?	2016-04-02 00:16:14Z	Carey Gregory
5288	5312	Science! And also doctors and other professionals... Even American Red Cross: "The American Red Cross now recommends that individuals who give blood frequently should take a multivitamin with iron or an iron-only supplement to replace the iron lost through blood donation. Before taking a multivitamin with iron or an iron-only supplement, you should consult with your health-care provider." Iron is needed to replace the lost blood (red cells to be specific). Each blood donation means about 200 mg of iron lost. Vitamin C increases iron absorbtion, coffe and tea decreases.	2016-04-02 00:20:48Z	user433966
5288	5312	If that quote was in your answer along with links showing where it came from, and if you provided sources backing up your assertions about vitamin C, coffee and tea, you'd have a great answer and I would reverse my downvote. :-)	2016-04-02 00:23:15Z	Carey Gregory
5288	5312	Much better but I think you should spend some time learning how to post quotes and links. The way you did it works but it's pretty cumbersome.	2016-04-02 00:37:15Z	Carey Gregory
5288	5312	Yup, bearing with you. Trying to toss out pointers here and there. :-)	2016-04-02 00:41:21Z	Carey Gregory
5286	5289	You should specify that HIV is transmitted through fluids.  You should also clarify that this is a retro-viral infection. HIV changes the genome. Since it "splices" itself into your genes your body begins to produce the virus naturally.	2016-03-30 15:20:08Z	FrankyG
5286	5289	@FrankyG Sure and thanks for the heads up.  I will add it as soon I get some time.	2016-03-30 17:46:01Z	Pobrecita
5276	5277	I do not want the details on stack exchange, I would like a link to those documents so I can see for myself. Making a 1000 page document about something doesn't make it right, I'd like to see for myself, especially after reading this: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/… which indicates there is something significantly lacking there. We are being told "as fact, every day you must" and I'm quite suspicious of that, having seen people thrive on diets that have about half the calcium required according to those guidelines.	2016-03-30 02:19:12Z	
5276	5277	And I definitely agree with you, because of ethical reasons we cannot test on twins and therefore cannot get a definitive answer. I think what I'm really after is some way of building an argument where micronutrient requirements should be looked at on a longer basis, say monthly, instead of creating something that is almost impossible to achieve daily without overeating. I'm finding that hitting 100% target on daily values is just unrealistic and the human race wouldn't have survived if that was the case.	2016-03-30 02:27:43Z	
5276	5277	" I would like a link to those documents so I can see for myself." Which I gave you. Is there anything missing? "and the human race wouldn't have survived if that was the case." malnutrition does not mean people die. Lots of people have a vitamin D deficiency, for example. And iron deficiencies. That means their health isn't optimal, that they may be more tired than the would be otherwise, maybe get sick more often, not that they die....	2016-03-30 05:05:37Z	YviDe
5270	5271	The calculations make sense, this must be it - thank you	2016-03-29 01:51:24Z	
5266	5320	Well said and also one more question related to this only is that, let us say I have been not chewing food properly for around 1 - 2 years so is it possible that it will affect my physical health by any means like less growth or something like that.	2016-04-02 15:35:51Z	
5266	5320	Absolutely not! All that happens when you don't chew food is: -Slower absorption of nutrients -Possibly less nutrients absorbed from the food (though you can eat more anyways) -More energy is used to digest the food chemically in the stomach (You know that feeling of being tired when you get stuffed? This tiredness can be reduced and will last less by chewing food more). The only real health risk is the possibility of choking, but I'm sure there's no effect on your health otherwise :)	2016-04-02 15:44:06Z	Coma

5254	9164	Hi! Welcome to Health SE. Could you please provide some references to support your claims (in accordance with the Health SE policies: health.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer). Thank you. BW	2016-09-14 21:08:24Z	S.Victor
5254	9164	source of the answer is added at the bottom.	2016-09-16 10:33:08Z	Lakshmi Balan
5254	9164	While this may be true for many people, it is not always the case - for example, in Diabetes (or early insulin resistance "prediabetes"), glycemic index is very important to consider.  Eating fruit with other foods can help slow absorption of its sugars and reduce blood sugar spikes.	2017-01-21 13:43:14Z	DoctorWhom
5252	5255	You've made a lot of assertions of fact in your answer but you provide no sources to support those assertions. Health.SE is a little different from most other SE sites in that we expect all assertions to be supported with credible scientific sources.	2016-03-27 19:44:05Z	Carey Gregory
5252	5255	With respect, the very first few words of my answer are "according to the NHS".	2016-03-27 19:53:18Z	user6847
5252	5255	As @CareyGregory said, sources for these types of assertions are expected here, just saying "according to X" isn't all that reliable. As for that number of mutations you mention, for example, the source is this study: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880489	2016-03-27 21:14:15Z	YviDe
5252	5255	Oh, and welcome to Health.SE! To clarify a bit more, there's also a lit of assertions in the second paragraph, like what toxins are you talking about? Why do you think those are stored in fat tissue instead of being eliminated from the body? What effect could this have (the OP is asking what the risks are, so I assume they are interested in that)? Dont get me wrong, this looks like the beginning of a good answer! It just needs some support for your assertions and maybe a few more specifics.	2016-03-27 21:28:31Z	YviDe
5252	5255	@Taladris It is, which is why I suggested how to improve it and didn't downvote it.	2016-03-28 04:35:53Z	Carey Gregory

5226	5227	Thanks ! I especially liked the examples and references to research papers.	2016-03-23 22:38:33Z	
5226	5227	Regarding summer flu -- I came down with influenza A early last August. I was told by the clinic that they had seen cases in July. The irony was I had planned to get a flu shot the next week.	2016-03-23 23:46:38Z	Carey Gregory
5226	5227	@CareyGregory that's early for a flu shot! So far, I have never had influenza, just colds (summer and winter), but I can imagine that are also not particularly pleasant when it's hot outside.	2016-03-24 11:11:39Z	YviDe
5215	5220	Your answer explains the basics of fecal transplants but doesn't answer the OP's specific question. How is it that the transplanted bacteria can overcome an established c. diff. colony?	2016-03-23 14:56:08Z	Carey Gregory
5215	5220	@carey i'm quite sure this is all whats happening. C difficile is normally overgrown with other competing bacteria so c difficile can't dominate. When those other bacteria are killed c difficile takes there place. The reintroduced bacteria just grow and compete with c difficile again.	2016-03-23 15:27:27Z	Nicow
5215	5220	Well, but how? Why would a larger, well-established colony not be able to dominate a smaller number of newcomers? (And, BTW, I'm not one of the downvoters.)	2016-03-23 19:10:55Z	Carey Gregory
5215	5220	Hmm, I think what might make it clearer why this can happen would be to point out that CD is not actually all that well-adapted to the human gut - it's mainly found in soil and only in 1 out of every 30 healthy humans (probably a combination of other bacteria outcompeting it and the human immune system killing it?)  Under normal circumstances, it doesn't stand a very good chance in the human gut. It's not actually part of that balanced commensalism you mention.	2016-03-23 19:22:45Z	YviDe
5215	5220	No, they're not the same. Your answer simply states that FMT works and you provide links to support that (however, wikipedia is a poor source). You don't delve into the why or how FMT works, and that's the gist of the question. The other answer does delve into those aspects.	2016-03-23 23:34:03Z	Carey Gregory
5208	5231	Some evidence for what you wrote would really support your material. Thanks!	2016-03-24 19:51:11Z	Pobrecita
5202	5219	This is the age of computers! I can calculate everything without stress :). Also, great link (and the answer of course!), thank you!	2016-05-16 02:26:10Z	
5199	5479	Good answer. It's also important to point out that while higher doses could have incremental benefit, they may also cause adverse effects. Taking more than 400 mg of ibuprofen at a time may not be safe for certain individuals, including the elderly, people with high blood pressure, or people with kidney disease.	2016-05-18 02:51:00Z	user2398029
5199	5479	We routinely use 1600 mg of slow release Ibuprofen for arthritis patients.	2016-05-18 02:55:47Z	Graham Chiu
5199	5479	As I'm sure you're aware, those slow release tablets will have different pharmacokinetics vs. the regular ones; higher doses can be tolerated because the compound is released over a longer period of time. In general, 3200 mg / 24h is the maximal safe dosage of ibuprofen for healthy adults. The maximal safe dosage would be much less in children or in people with comorbid disease.	2016-05-18 03:08:00Z	user2398029
5199	5479	Sure, I was just pointing out that drugs can be formulated in different ways to reduce the toxicity.	2016-05-18 04:14:32Z	Graham Chiu
5179	9790	Welcome to health SE :-). Thank you for taking the time to answer my question.

5175	5176	Good info, but I think the core answer is not right: I was in fact listing IC, not IRV (though the values are similar). I just put an NRB on a tank of regular air with a 25L/min regulator. The bag fills in about 2 seconds, and if I'm resting it's more than adequate. But if I do a minute of squat-jumps my breathing rate is roughly 1 cycle per second. I put the NRB on and I'm sucking the full bag down in less than half a breath, after which I'm fighting the safety valve and mask seal to get enough air. If I were in respiratory distress it seems like it would only make things worse!	2016-03-19 01:19:20Z	
5175	5176	So if there aren't larger-capacity NRBs I'm thinking that they must not be used on people who are hyperventilating.  Perhaps I'm mistaken in assuming that there are traumatic scenarios that call for oxygen in which the subject is able to breathe deeply?	2016-03-19 01:22:53Z	
5175	5176	@Lysander You're comparing apples and oranges. Someone in respiratory distress doesn't inhale deep, forceful breaths as you do during exertion. They almost always breath very rapidly and shallowly. In 15 years of EMS I have never seen a patient deflate a reservoir, or even come close, and I've seen many instances of extreme respiratory distress all the way up to and including respiratory arrest.	2016-03-19 01:34:24Z	Carey Gregory
5175	5176	@Lysander You also need to consider that in your experiment you were breathing 21% O2, while a real patient with a NRB is breathing 100% O2. Every liter you breathed carried 1/5th as much O2 as what a patient would get, so find a tank of O2 and repeat your experiment with O2. I think you'll get vastly different results.	2016-03-19 01:37:41Z	Carey Gregory
5175	5176	Ah ha, I was thinking that your first comment might be the answer -- i.e., "you don't need supplemental O2 if you can breathe like that."  (Update your answer with that and I'll accept it!)  I am curious to try the exercise experiment with 100% O2.  I'll report back when I get a cylinder to try.	2016-03-19 01:40:44Z	
5169	5182	This information is already contained in the question. It doesn't provide an answer.	2016-03-20 14:53:20Z	Carey Gregory
5164	5235	I am willing to believe the statistics were made up on House M.D.  My question, though, was whether there is a high risk of death when one contracts HepA after they contracted HepC.  You first study has a mortality rate of 35%!  The third has it as 7%.  So perhaps it's not high", but instead startling.  So I'd say, whatever it is, it sounds like it's more than enough to start publicizing this more!  And I also think there's no question - you have provided very good source material!	2016-03-25 03:13:18Z	
5159	5161	You should accept your answer.	2016-03-16 19:51:38Z	Carey Gregory
5159	5161	@CareyGregory I can't do until tomorrow, but I shall, thanks	2016-03-17 09:55:24Z	
5155	10284	This has the start of a great answer (it's how I would expect an OT to reply to the question in person).  On Health SE, we ask that answers include references to back up claims (personal experience is not included).  I might go into postural and stance exercises for specific points that can be referenced.	2016-11-30 21:45:34Z	Atl LED
5154	5160	Thanks Mitchel! I heard of the 2 hour tolerance test and believe that could also be beneficial.  Just want to avoid any future health problems if possible :)	2016-03-16 17:15:15Z	
5154	5160	Absolutely great to have people who are proactive about their health. The insulin resistance issue is massive and the rise in diabetes is tragic but preventable with the right approach.	2016-03-16 22:15:11Z	Mitchel M.D.
5148	5149	Besides, there is a groove line in the middle of the pill if it is approved to be splitted in Europe. Also, splitting can also affect the dissolving time both in the stomach and intestine.	2016-03-16 09:04:47Z	bantandor
5148	5149	@bantandor Although I believe that the pill being scored indicates that it's okay to split them, I can't find an authoritative source saying so, which is why I didn't add that to my answer. If you know of such a source for Europe, please add it and I'll edit it into my answer.	2016-03-16 18:42:42Z	Carey Gregory
5147	5193	Instead of quoting the NYT, which is quoting a study, it would be better to link to the original study, which is this: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19145994	2016-03-22 21:15:15Z	YviDe
5147	5193	@YviDe Thanks.I'll try to edit it in soon.	2016-03-23 00:55:44Z	Pobrecita
5129	5137	Thank you very much for the answer, now I understand. My relative has a problem with clotting factor 8 - (233, norm is 150).	2016-03-15 11:34:23Z	
5088	5089	The link you provided to support your 99% figure actually says 95% (after I managed to drill through the ads and found the info). And half your answer is a sermon on HIV. She didn't ask about HIV or sexual counseling.	2016-03-11 06:27:59Z	Carey Gregory
5088	5089	Sorry, but you are not correct. Quote from the website: "Women take the pill by mouth to prevent pregnancy, and, when taken correctly, it is up to 99.9% effective." The question also clearly extends beyond the pill: Quote: "and any other facts I need to know about the pill"	2016-03-11 07:29:29Z	Chris
5088	5089	@CareyGregory You are constructing misleading commentary that is simply incorrect. The only reference on that page regarding a 95% figure is related to a "mini pill", which is explicitly referred to as "less effective than the standard pill", which is clearly what this was about.	2016-03-11 07:33:03Z	Chris
5088	5089	@CareyGregory It's really repulsive to everyone involved if you desperately try to find something wrong with an answer - if you don't want people to exchange knowledge here, then please don't participate.	2016-03-11 07:36:54Z	Chris
5088	5089	I'm citing the figures found at the link you provided. Unfortunately, your link is to WebMD, which is a poor source, and it's not to a specific topic but to a general discussion.Therefore, I had to wade through advertising to find the info on my own, and the first info I found was for the mini pill. In fact, I don't see a link to effectiveness for standard pills anywhere on that page. Also, no other source I can find gives birth control pills the 99.9% effectiveness you claim so you really do need to provide a definitive source for that number.	2016-03-11 15:16:56Z	Carey Gregory
5085	5097	Sorry for the extremely late reply, the notification seems to have been lost in my inbox. Thank you very much!	2016-04-06 12:35:41Z	
5079	5221	This is a fantastic answer. I wasn't aware that there was a metric for how much of a nutrient is used by the body. That gives me a lot to work with for future research. I really appreciate your thoroughness!	2016-03-23 18:01:49Z	
5079	5221	@bsayegh thank you! I might like researching a bit too much ;-)	2016-03-23 18:05:33Z	YviDe
5079	5221	I think this is an excellent place to out that most vitamins must be taken in the middle or end of a meal to maximize bioavailability. The number of families I run into missing that is astonishing. Also very few people are able to meet micronutrient recommendations w/o a basic multivitamin, even when intentionally following a balanced diet.	2016-03-23 23:57:32Z	Atl LED
5079	5221	Also, on the concern that some may view my comment to mean some brands of vitamins don't have to be, I mean specific nutrients, chiefly soluble acids (folic acid, vitamin C, etc) don't get as much of a boost by being taken with a meal so they can be taken alone. As a general statement, however, it's better to take them all with a meal.	2016-03-24 00:01:55Z	Atl LED
5079	5122	This does not in any way answer the question, which is about digestion of protein bars and not about whether to use them or which ones to use.	2016-03-14 07:51:15Z	YviDe
5079	5122	This is like what I would read off of someone's health blog. I want hoping for sources to studies that have scientifically proven that one method of ingesting nutrients was better than the other. I don't even need a link, just tell me about it and ill look it up. I don't think this answer provides that information.	2016-03-14 13:42:16Z	
5077	5115	Good answer but you are giving reference of 1999, which seems quite old.	2016-03-14 17:28:49Z	
5077	5115	Good point.  The 1999 guidelines never had an update actually which is why it ended up being so old.  The ACC/AHA addressed "updates" in different papers so it hard to collect them into just one document but I will change it to reference the most recent paper which is from 2014.  Thank you!!	2016-03-14 20:43:42Z	Rakesh Patel

5062	5071	@BrettZamir the problem here is that there isn't even anything on that Wikipedia page that supports the answer. I'm still not sure what it's a source for in this answer,  other than it being an amino acid. And as a side note, I wouldn't use the Encyclopedia  Britannica as a source for anything but definition of terms on here, either. It's not a medical textbook.	2016-03-11 18:49:11Z	YviDe
5055	5139	That's a great time-lapse but it doesn't actually answer the question of whether it's normal or not. It only demonstrates that someone else observed the same phenomenon, which could be abnormal. (It's not, but that's beside the point.) Find a reliable source that says it is normal and you've got a good answer.	2016-03-14 18:11:27Z	Carey Gregory
5054	5083	IMO, this line of reasoning just doesn't work. First, your chosen conditions are whatever you thought of off the top of your head.  More importantly, the principles of population screening are much more complicated and take into account whether identification of an abnormality is likely to improve outcomes, a question that requires careful study design and data analysis to account for lead-time bias, etc. The principles outlined in the landmark paper by Wilson and Jungner (1968) are further nuanced in newer studies, e.g. Harris, 2011.	2016-03-10 08:54:40Z	Susan
5054	5083	@Susan I've rewritten the answer. One has to condition on the available information. What matters is that if this is repeated many times, the patients do better as judged by the chosen health criterion compared to any alternative choice for X. Omitting information used to condition the probabilities on (e.g. observations that the patient looks a bit overweight) can influence the health gains of the tests, but you are still going to find the optimal strategy given that you decide not to consider the weight of the patient.	2016-03-10 17:55:04Z	Count Iblis
5054	5083	Anyway, different issue : as I read the question, it's a practical one -- what has been shown to be helpful? This answer is about a theoretical model of how to determine this  (though I would maintain that this is better done by way of empirical data..... the requisite "known statistics" in your model aren't known at all, and the risks of screening are yet another issue to be considered), but I don't think actually answers the OPs questions except by a couple guesses in the first paragraph.	2016-03-10 23:21:33Z	Susan
5053	5104	While I agree with the "No", that seems like a strange argument. For one thing, we don't even know whether the OP is in a country that would issue these warnings. Again, I agree with the conclusion, but "there's no warning on it" isn't a good explanation...	2016-03-14 22:44:56Z	YviDe
5053	5104	-1 for the lazy answer. I also agree the answer is no but it should be trivial to find a better justification.	2016-03-15 01:12:27Z	Carey Gregory
5053	5104	@CareyGregory updated.	2016-03-15 01:15:22Z	jiggunjer
5053	5104	@YviDe Feel free to suggest how OP can measure his remote control light. But in my opinion some things should just be written down to common knowledge.	2016-03-15 01:16:02Z	jiggunjer
5053	5104	I wouldn't expect you to suggest measuring the device, but I would expect there are standards published on IR device safety. You can bet the manufacturers of those products know exactly what those standards are.	2016-03-15 01:22:00Z	Carey Gregory
5053	5145	Also, I believe remote controls don't use lasers. Incoherent light being even safer.	2016-03-16 01:14:04Z	jiggunjer

4994	4999	Makes sense. Is there any reason not to do a fiberotomy on the top and bottom of every person every time, even with retainers? Why isn't the procedure more common? It seems like the worst that can happen is it has no effect, but what's the deciding factor on whether to perform the procedure or not?	2016-02-29 17:50:30Z	
4994	4999	I actually don't have an excellent answer to that, but I'm not sure if anyone would want to pay for an additional treatment that doesn't actually prevent the crowding from happening again. To paraphrase my previous answer, cutting the ligament fibers will do nothing against the squeletal changes of the jaw. They are two completely separate processes, which have a similar effect of crowding the teeth.	2016-02-29 17:57:01Z	enap_mwf
4988	5259	Also: if for whatever reason you have really lots of fibre in your food, you will need extra fluids that go with them into your system. Otherwise those, especially the insoluble, might lead to constipation and "a hard time".	2017-09-12 07:12:04Z	LangLangC
4980	4983	When you say local you mean local to me or local to my friend?	2016-02-28 08:34:41Z	
4980	4983	@traisjames I'd imagine Carey means the emergency number in the part of the world they are in.  So for example 112 in their European Union and most other countries in Europe.	2016-02-28 11:42:48Z	YviDe
4980	4983	@traisjames I mean the emergency number you would call if you had an emergency, as YviDe said. They will be able to connect you to emergency services where your friend lives faster than you can find it on your own.	2016-02-28 16:06:00Z	Carey Gregory
4969	5010	Is it prescription-only everywhere in the world?	2016-03-02 14:10:28Z	Carey Gregory
4969	5010	@CareyGregory I wouldn't dare say everywhere in the world, but in the most part it is a controlled substance, and therefore the laws in most countries would regulate it as prescription-only. There are, probably, countries where the law is poorly enforced, i.e. the substance is, by law, prescription-only, but you can freely by it in a pharmacy without a prescription. These medicines are classified as controlled substances by the UN and from that link you can see that national authorities (such as the individual EU countries) accept this	2016-03-02 14:26:57Z	Lucky
4958	4974	Hi thanks for the answer. I don't have insomnia per se. My problem is that if I am on a diet then I wake up too early because I get so hungry in my sleep. I am trying to avoid this. Yesterday I ate some nuts and biscuits before going to sleep and I managed to sleep some 10 hours (I was kinda tired too).	2016-02-28 09:59:25Z	
4958	4974	This doesn't appear to answer the original question, which is about not waking up hungry, not about what foods promote sleep.	2016-02-29 05:54:55Z	YviDe
4958	4974	@YviDe Yes, exactly. The point of the original question is how to be on a diet and still have a good night sleep.	2016-02-29 13:22:17Z	
4958	4974	@Mick, yes that is a good way to re-phrase the question. Probably protein with some kind of complex carbs, that was my guess too.	2016-02-29 15:17:45Z	
4958	5001	Eating shortly before going to bed can cause ulcers and   gastroperesis? I think you really need to back this up with some references.	2016-03-09 17:39:51Z	YviDe
4958	5001	Along with the appropriate request for references on ulcers and gastroperesis, I would like to see evidence for the stomach remaining full for 9 hours. Digestion does not shut down while sleeping.	2016-03-09 17:51:58Z	JohnP
4954	4957	Really helpful answer, thank you very much!	2016-02-28 21:52:54Z	
4954	4957	@user45623 I'm not sure paresthesia is the correct answer for your question, since paresthesia has "no apparent physical cause".  If your sensations really are caused by hair, then it's not paresthesia.  Sometimes I get a sensation, and after I pull the hair out, the sensation is gone - that's not paresthesia.	2016-06-01 19:00:01Z	pacoverflow
4954	4957	@pacoverflow I haven't tried pulling the hairs, but based on the symptoms anongoodnurse's description sounds right to me. I'm not even totally sure if I'm actually feeling hairs or it's just a nerve misfiring.	2016-06-16 21:32:08Z	
4953	10502	Thank you for the answer, but I think this is different than what you've described. The pain Im talking about happens immediately and intensely on swallowing and lasts for about a second as the air (and whatever you were drinking) passes through the pharynx (possibly the esophagus and/or the various UES, LES sphincters) It feels like I expect a heart attack might feel and I've even experienced this extreme shooting pain all the way into my arms and chest.	2016-12-16 21:07:59Z	
4953	10502	@Shanimal, try drinking slower? I have a big mouth so I've experienced that once or twice and usually when I am intaking a large amount. I'm guessing the water traps the air and causes a large bubble like structure trying to fit into the little space your throat can offer thus causing pain. I couldn't tell you why it may travel to your expenditures unless the bubble is large enough to actually put pressure on your heart.	2017-08-03 16:34:38Z	GibralterTop
4959	4960	@Rodrigo Which is my point...	2017-04-18 15:05:58Z	L.B.
4959	4960	@Rodrigo As with all other surgeries there is inherent risk. Even in wisdom tooth removal you can die. You can bleed profusely and die, you can have a reaction to the medications and die... The list goes on.	2017-04-18 17:26:21Z	L.B.
4959	4960	@Rodrigo I've never seen anyone die from a tooth removal. To quote yourself: Look again. Oh, and I almost forgot: please do your homework before commenting.	2017-04-18 21:19:12Z	Narusan-in-coma
4959	4960	This is exactly the point @L.B., the others and me are trying to make: Death is a potential downside of anything. Unless the probability is either high or known, it doesn't qualify as an answer though.	2017-04-18 21:20:15Z	Narusan-in-coma

4941	4985	Great answer! I've been taking Naproxen EC plus a PPI (omeprazole) for three days now and have experienced no gastrointestinal issues whatsoever. I'm only taking the PPI for a seven-week period.	2016-02-28 20:04:11Z	
4937	4940	I see. That makes more sense indeed. Thanks	2016-02-24 18:54:02Z	
4928	4939	Good answer. +1.  The truth is, one can't tell the difference by symptomatology alone. The major differentiating factor that would tip off a health professional is knowledge of exposure to rodent droppings.	2016-02-24 18:29:45Z	anongoodnurse
4924	4926	Also, I think it's worth mentioning (but not a complete answer) that one of the major effects of ibuprofen is that it is an anti-inflammatory . That effect takes time (from my experience, a day or two). I don't quite agree with your comment about ibuprofen only taking away the pain symprom becasue of this - NSAIDs are used to treat the cause (inflammation), as well. If prescribed to treat inflammation (and of course I have no idea whether that's the case in the situation described by the OP), NSAIDs can be very helpful.	2016-02-23 13:27:14Z	YviDe
4924	4926	@YviDe Agreed, I forgot to mention the time factor involved with anti-inflammatory action. I assumed (but perhaps shouldn't have) that the OP has cavities and this caused the pain - the way to solve this is to endure some drilling at the dentist's (unfortunately) not just to pop NSAIDs. But you are right, the OP might suffer from a different underlying cause - I'll edit.	2016-02-23 13:32:59Z	Lucky
4924	4926	@YviDe I would agree if this were chronic inflammation such as arthritis or an injury where healing might be improved by reducing inflammation, but it's not. A toothache is almost always due to infection, which anti-inflammatory drugs can't treat. It's purely pain relief in this case and will probably only get worse until the OP visits a dentist.	2016-02-23 15:51:10Z	Carey Gregory
4924	4926	@CareyGregory which is why I said "If prescribed to treat inflammation (and of course I have no idea whether that's the case in the situation described by the OP)". And infection can lead to inflammation, so ibuprofen can be a good choice for treating tooth pain. Just, of course, in addition to getting the actual cause treated.	2016-02-23 15:54:20Z	YviDe
4919	11818	Some of the sources are in German. If someone is interested, tell me which parts you'd like to read and I shall translate them.	2017-04-04 15:24:57Z	Narusan-in-coma
4919	11818	In the US it's also true that only a doctor can declare you dead, but a paramedic can presume you dead. It's purely a legal distinction and the end result is exactly the same. That's true in most western countries so probably Germany as well.	2017-04-10 18:00:56Z	Carey Gregory
4919	11818	Well, in Germany a doctor always has to do the checking, so the distinction is quite important as two people will be looking at you if a paramedic is involved. To be precise: if a paramedic presumes you dead, they will immediately call a doctor (Notarzt), which then has to examine you.	2017-04-10 19:11:06Z	Narusan-in-coma
4919	11818	But, to be honest, a paramedic can assess whether you have died as well as a doctor in my experience... False declarations of death are more current in hospitals where paramedics are generally not involved. That's what my answer was focussing on.	2017-04-10 19:25:05Z	Narusan-in-coma
4919	11818	It wasn't a criticism of your answer. The same formality of a doctor declaring death has to happen in the US, though it would be highly unusual to have a doctor actually come to the scene to do so. The death certificate is usually signed later by a coroner, although when the death is timely and not suspicious, that can usually be accomplished over the phone between paramedics, police and coroner.	2017-04-10 20:40:39Z	Carey Gregory

4901	4902	Thank you, I read it, but it talks first about HIV, then AIDS as the final stage of HIV, then says that HIV PROBABLY was transmitted from chimpanzee, but it still doesn't really answers my question, so my new question is, What caused PRE-Mutated HIV in chimpanzee ?	2016-02-20 22:00:18Z

4893	4900	Thank you so much Carey, because of very high acidity and a patch (ulcer) in my digestive track, just below the rib-cage, my doctor advised me to drink milk, but cow and buffalo milk gives me gas, to avoid that I searched for alternative and it was goat's milk, but in India it is not available, so I had to get the goat milk from a person whose primary business is something else, he has few goats to whom he feeds vegetable-cuttings, but I also saw the goats in the garbage, that made me wonder if the milk is safe.	2016-02-21 09:07:39Z	
4875	4909	Heh, I had just started writing an answer saying pretty much the same things :-)	2016-02-21 19:54:07Z	YviDe
4875	4909	@YviDe I'm sorry :-(. But if you have another/simpler phrasing (my answers tend to be a bit verbose) or other references, please do post. It will be beneficial for the users, and we don't exactly have the best answer per question ratio as a site.	2016-02-21 19:56:29Z	Lucky
4875	4909	@1Fish There were some rather bombastic headlines regarding this type of research. I, personally, find that quite unethical - promises of 'miraculous' effects by the journalists (and not scientists) gives false hope to the patients and their families. Furthermore, when a reliable, well known therapeutic option is working, it is against common sense to go for a more risky one. And killing off the immune system and establishing it again is rather risky.	2016-02-21 20:07:25Z	Lucky
4875	4909	It's rather like those giant headlines about curing HIV. Killing the whole immune system with chemotherapy and then replacing it with a bone marrow transplant from one of the people immune to it is interesting, but nothing we can do for millions of people.	2016-02-21 20:11:23Z	YviDe
4875	4909	@1Fish_2Fish_RedFish_BlueFish It's not just the risks of chemotherapy, it's the risk of killing the immune system - those patients are very susceptible to infection, and also how exactly the immune system will be when it has rebuilt is never 100% sure. I agree that it's a promising procedure, but in MS the risks outweigh the benefits. In cca 10% of the patients another, different autoimmune disease develops after the transplant. (Thanks for the formatting tip :-))	2016-02-21 20:20:18Z	Lucky
4874	4878	Do you have a source confirming that the receptors are indeed blocked permanently? The effects of antihistamines generally wear off within 4-6 hours and it would be pretty surprising that receptors could be replaced that quickly.	2016-02-19 16:06:12Z	Carey Gregory
4874	4878	Sorry, maybe I was unclear here. I answered about the meaning of the "irreversible antagonist" in principle, and assumed that the OP's information that his drug is an irreversible antagonist is correct. I don't know the different antihistamines well enough to know if it is possible that the drug the OP took is indeed an irreversible antagonist, or if he misunderstood that part. I don't know the half-life of histamine receptors specifically (they probably differ by type too), although I've heard of receptors with half-life of less than a day before.	2016-02-19 16:21:14Z	rumtscho
4874	4878	I'm going to ask the OP to name the drug then because I find it an interesting question and it may well depend on the specific drug.	2016-02-19 16:35:22Z	Carey Gregory
4874	4878	Indeed, it's a very interesting topic. Note that the cell is a complex system which actively repairs itself, so I think degradation is sped up for at least some types of blocked receptors, but certainly not all. The histamine receptors are G-protein coupled, and I remember dimly that these have a longish lifetime (unblocked) when compared to other receptors? My memory is a bit weak on that.	2016-02-19 16:55:19Z	rumtscho
4874	4876	It seems logical, but I've found another information that still leaves me unsatified: "inhibition persist even after an irreversible antagonist is removed".	2016-02-19 09:35:03Z

4816	4829	How can blood pressure be measured during sleep without waking up the patient?	2016-02-15 04:42:36Z	Count Iblis
4816	4829	@CountIblis I wore an ambulatory BP monitor for 24 hours recently. Although you're certainly aware when it takes a measurement because it inflates the cuff, it did not awaken me once.	2016-02-15 05:08:55Z	Carey Gregory
4816	4843	I don't think fitbit ( or any other smartphone based app) is accurate in tracking sleep; as per fitbit help: If you’re not moving but not asleep for long periods of time it’s possible for your tracker to falsely record sleep, in which case you can delete the sleep record from your dashboard	2016-02-22 04:34:32Z	
4816	4840	Knowing how much time they need to fall asleep on average isn't really going to help with knowing if you slept at all and how much, though. There really are people who often fall asleep within minutes and then the next day they need an hour.	2016-02-16 13:57:46Z	YviDe

4678	4679	"If there was warning, why would there be a crash?" --> Because the brakes don't allow you to immediately stop  the car.	2017-04-15 15:37:58Z	
4678	4679	@FranckDernoncourt: But one can drive around the obstacle to prevent collision if there is a warning. Unless your driving against a straight wall, I presume, yet even then you can try to turn your car with 180 degree. In my experience, you only have an "oh shoot"-moment before the crash and only very few humans are able to react in that short period of time.	2017-04-18 11:52:02Z	Narusan-in-coma
4678	4679	@Narusan sometimes you can drive around the obstacle to prevent collision. Sometimes it's not possible or not preferable. E.g., see some  car races or some car accidents on YouTube. You may also be the passenger in which case you can try to brace yourself while the drive that is attempting to avoid the collision.	2017-04-18 13:48:15Z	
4678	4679	@FranckDernoncourt Does it really matter? As I said in the answer, if the collision occurs you're going to be forced into an upright sitting position whether you like it or not, so what brace position could you even assume?	2017-04-18 13:54:03Z	Carey Gregory
4678	4679	@CareyGregory I cannot write  answers in the comments on this Stack Exchange website, but for example F1 race drivers do receive some advice on what to do in case they see that are going to crash, and that's for a reason.	2017-04-18 13:55:25Z	
4667	4670	Okey..but is there a significant of the number of neurons the brain has??	2016-02-07 15:27:06Z	
4667	4670	I'm afraid I didn't understand your question. If you are asking how many neurons are there in the human brain, this is difficult to answer, but estimates point to something between 10 billion and 100 billion neurons.	2016-02-07 16:21:32Z	Executer
4663	4665	Do testosterone levels decline primarily as a function of age or does it depend primarily on things like exercise intensity, fitness and muscle mass which tends to decline as we age? So, if someone aged 50 is exercising much harder,  has much better fitness level and has way more muscle mass than when he was 35, will his testosterone level still be a lot lower than what it was when he was 35?	2016-02-06 21:48:27Z	Count Iblis
4663	4665	@CountIblis, Again, I recommend asking these as separate questions. Fish, you interpreted the question correctly. I only mentioned boosters as an introduction/background to the question.	2016-02-06 23:54:32Z	
4654	4660	I wasn't sure if I should just edit this, but I think your first sentence, especially with the link provided, could use a little tweaking.  I would think replacing injury with wound, (maybe also with a link to the Wiki article on wound), would be better.  Things like burn injuries confound the way it is written now.	2016-02-07 01:42:52Z	Atl LED
4654	4660	How do I know if it requires sutures?	2016-02-07 04:12:47Z	
4654	4660	A laceration is a laceration, regardless of the cause. It's erroneous to say that a laceration can't result from a bite, from broken glass or a blade. [E.g. "Facial lacerations from dog bites or cat bites are almost always closed.... - NEJM.] You're right, though, in saying that blunt trauma causes lacerations by compression (a type of stretching.) That site is not in keeping with the actual medical literature. (I did do a quick search of the medical literature to verify.)	2016-02-10 00:06:57Z	anongoodnurse
4636	4641	Good answer but I sure wish you could find a more definitive source for the PH numbers. Leaflady doesn't state where they got those numbers.	2016-02-03 05:07:33Z	Carey Gregory
4636	4641	I made a minor edit (I hope that you don't mind, but you can always roll back to the original version if you do), because you wrote yourself that pH fluctuates in all parts of the GIT. A further reference that you might use: gut.bmj.com/content/30/5/573.abstract. The only part I slightly disagree with is the part about acid-base imbalance: the 'allowed' range of the pH in blood is far more narrow than that in the GIT, hence gut and stomach pH fluctuations will be higher than those in blood. For acidosis/alkalosis, the kidneys and lungs are the organs that compensate, not GIT. Overall +1	2016-02-03 08:48:48Z	Lucky

4630	4634	It's a useful consideration, but it only partly answers my question - I'm concerned with marrow transplants only. I know they can often meet (depends on a country) - but if it's allowed in a given country, why delay that by a year or two? Reading your answer it gives a clue here - maybe this time is reserved so that it's more clear whether transplant helped the recipient or not. Willingness to meet could depend on that I suppose. I +1 your answer for the wide view on a topic, but I'm not accepting it just yet. Thanks!	2016-02-02 21:39:49Z	
4630	4634	Hey @Carey Gregory - I asked that question to the staff at one of the the bone marrow transplant foundations, and I got this answer I wanted to share (below): health.stackexchange.com/a/4938/2823	2016-02-24 15:16:44Z

4626	4964	I'd go with the mods on this - there must be some source of information about this, such as this one. Furthermore, the OP has given a specific medicine - levothyroxine sodium -  a case where I disagree with your point No 3 - it's a medication taken chronically, patients mostly know how to use it and they don't visit their endocrinologist every 2 months, nor do they, in normal circumstances, do TSH and other analysis that often.	2016-02-28 13:08:40Z	Lucky
4626	4964	@Lucky I have to agree with shnisaka here. My own insurance carrier, one of the major US companies, has various rules they apply as to when I can and can't refill prescriptions. I can't find those rules anywhere in my subscriber info or on their web site, and they're certainly not state law. For example, they won't refill a prescription until 2-3 days before the last one runs out, even if you're going to be traveling. For a business trip I had to call them to get an early refill, and even then they only authorized 5 days' worth to get me through the trip instead of the full 30 days.	2016-02-28 21:24:20Z	Carey Gregory
4626	4964	@lucky deleted that point to make the answer more universal. In retail, pharmacist gets paid hourly and most of the time wants the best for his/her patients. If you fill a prescription and I notice that It is cheaper to give you 30 days than 90 days.. I would give you the 30 days.. it is a good customer service.	2016-02-28 22:22:22Z	shnisaka
4626	4964	@Lucky There are many aspects of the American health care "system" that would be difficult for non-Americans to believe. Way off topic to discuss but trust me, it's broken in many ways.	2016-02-28 23:15:14Z	Carey Gregory

4613	4622	Generally when something has a subscript, it's a reference to a source in a bibliography. If you put that at the end of your own interpretation, it implies to a reader that it's taken from a reference, not that it is your own writing.

4585	4617	such tests are not "accurate" especially when they are positive. This is due to such tests having a rather low sensitivity (true positive rate).... -- When faced with a positive test, specificity rather than sensitivity is relevant.  "True positive rate" is ambiguous (if describing sensitivity it indicates the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified rather than the proportion of identified positives that are true), but in any case false positives are due to poor specificity.	2016-03-06 08:40:27Z	Susan
4585	4617	The accuracy of a positive test is equal to: # true positive observations/(# true positive obs. + # false positive obs.).  So, sensitivity (true positive rate) plays an important role in both numerator and  denominator.  Specificity (true negative rate) plays a role in generating # false positive observations.  However, the big driver in generating # false positive obs. is not so much specificity but the prevalence rate of the specific disease being screened.  A test with high specificity testing a disease with low prevalence rate will still generate a lot of false positives.	2016-03-07 05:03:48Z

4538	4566	The downvotes are for a lack of research, that's all. We're trying to get users to show a tad of effort. On EL&U, people need to explain/show that they've looked a word up in a dictionary before asking about it. On Biology, lack of any research is closed as homework. Skeptics requires sources (for questions and answers.) There's little virtue in building an answer from the ground up when the OP can meet us a little bit of the way. And of course, to an epidemiologist this will be more nuanced than to the average person.	2016-01-29 23:04:11Z	anongoodnurse
4538	4566	I agree with this answer, by the way. Much of medicine and the terms used to describe various phenomena are more ambiguous than most people realize.	2016-01-29 23:10:46Z	anongoodnurse
4538	4566	We should probably be having this conversation in meta or in chat, but as it seems to be taking place here, I thought I'd weigh in. I agree it's generically a fine question. When I google the 1st sentence, the CDC page you quote is the second hit. I would have come in for an answer if that had been linked to, seeking further information. I'm uncertain if a basic level of research should be done, but I think it's not a bad idea (∴ my meta posts). In the meantime it doesn't seem to be policy ∴my lack of vote 1 way or the other. As you seem to come from the other side, I would value your 2 cents.	2016-01-30 02:47:50Z	Atl LED

4498	5469	"supplying anti-inflamatory drugs to the entire joint" what does this mean?	2016-04-14 02:58:00Z	Graham Chiu
4498	5469	@GrahamChiu I will certainly give deference to a rheumatologist or others with more relevant experience (I'm in ID), but my understanding is that supplying an NSAID to the surrounding tissues (ligaments, tendons, muscle, etc) that might not be inflamed results in better outcome than only applying to the inflamed/insulted tissue.  Am I wrong in my understanding?	2016-04-14 14:03:09Z	Atl LED
4498	5469	I'm not aware of this concept. Do you have an actual reference that is not behind a firewall? To me the entire joint also includes synovium, cartilage, bone etc, so treating those seems unnecessary.	2016-04-14 19:20:11Z	Graham Chiu
4498	5469	@GrahamChiu  I will dig for one.  I agree the entire joint is poor wording.  I'm editing to change it to "surrounding muscle and tendons."	2016-04-14 19:24:23Z	Atl LED
4498	5469	@GrahamChiu It may be better if we hash out the details in chat, but I'm finding a lot of the sources behind pay walls saying things like NSAIDs for "surrounding supportive adipose, connective, and muscle tissue."

4482	5029	+1; in fact, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumour suppressor genes; mutations that destroy these genes make the carrier of the mutation more likely to develop certain types of cancer. A (partial or complete) “absence” of these genes would be roughly equivalent to a mutation of these genes, as far as cancer susceptibility is concerned: in both cases there’s an absence of the properly functioning gene.	2016-03-05 14:10:32Z	Konrad Rudolph

4451	4461	Brilliant answer! I'm not sure if the prognosis is dependent on "How long it's been that way", though. I think that one of the major factors in diminishing these creases, is skin tone. I.e. they're more significant on some than they are on another. I suppose, another factor to consider would be how "big" he was, too.	2016-01-20 15:33:16Z	user19679

4426	4863	"There is no clear evidence in favour of low fat or low carb diet for weight loss" To clarify, the trials I have read attribute the success of either method to what the diet-ee is most likely to be able to maintain, based on their cultural background and current diet. For example, a traditional Indian diet is complemented by low-fat fairly well. I agree that the point about good-health-eat-balanced but as a method for losing weight, counting calories has been long-proven to be the most effective. The laws of thermodynamics are quite hard to prove wrong.	2017-03-02 13:45:38Z	JJosaur

4413	4633	"females compensate for smaller total brain volume by having increased gray matter, and therefore more tissue available for computation." You are misinterpreting (or at least vastly oversimplifying) Gur's work, (I think misinterpreting).	2016-02-02 18:29:48Z	anongoodnurse
4413	4633	From the abstract of the paper in question: "Because GM consists of the somatodendritic tissue of neurons whereas WM comprises myelinated connecting axons, the higher percentage of GM makes more tissue available for computation relative to transfer across distant regions.

4386	4196	Those faces! :-D Sorry, but those are just too awesome. Thanks, this is very helpful.  (and it made me remember that my rheumatologist has a question "on a scale from 0 to 10, how much did the symptoms impact your daily life during the last week?" That was, in my opinion, a great question to assess a chronic illness)	2015-12-26 19:54:22Z	
4386	4197	Oh, also very interesting, thanks. I especially like the question in the linked document "At what number is the pain at an acceptable level for you?" A very helpful question in those situations.	2015-12-26 20:13:58Z

4368	4371	So basically you're saying that ingestion of different kinds of food causes the release of varying degrees of - or different - anorexigenic peptides which then signal satiety (in addition tovagal stimulation by mechanical and chemical receptors in the gut and environmental factors)? +1	2016-01-13 05:08:48Z	anongoodnurse
4368	4371	@anongoodnurse Yes, I'm saying that. But I'm also saying that it's not very relevant. The point is, many people have a very wrong idea of the human body, thinking that the facets of our perception are a direct sensory measurement of some objective quality in the outer world - that vision is a simple translation of lightwaves the way a camera translates them, that the feeling of pain is a simple message of "tissue is damaged", that the feeling of hunger is a simple message of "not enough calories ingested". The question was obviously posted starting from such a wrong view. I tried to (cont.)	2016-01-13 12:52:34Z	rumtscho
4368	4371	(cont.) convey that it is, as all other feelings, the output of a neural network working in the brain, and that none of the inputs has a deterministic connection to it. I also listed the main inputs which have already been found, and noted that the very simple "suspects" like calorie number only have a very indirect influence on the feeling. Of course, it's a very complex message to bring across in the short space, especially when I don't have all the exact mechanisms in my head.	2016-01-13 12:55:07Z	rumtscho
4368	4371	It can also be affected in a somewhat psychological way. When you eat excessively oily food some people will immediately associate the oily feeling with fullness, and oiliness can also be unappetizing per se. It's a different story if you absorb the oil in something else. The point I want to make is that it also has a psychological aspect, not just physiological and neurological aspects.	2016-01-17 22:09:16Z	busukxuan
4365	4405	You haven't actually responded to his/her, true question. The OP is enquiring about Acne and Dermatology. OP is asking, whether the pure product or the dilute product is better to use considering his skin type and hence, why the question was posted in Health.SE and not elsewhere. You only have information/"fluff", about the different products which is somewhat irrelevant and unimportant.	2016-01-15 17:18:56Z	user19679
4365	4405	@user19679 If you will note, other than the tag, there is no mention of acne in the question.  Further, I asked very clearly in a comment to the question what the witch hazel was for (which again, is not provided in the question).  Then, if you look at the first sentence of my answer, I acknowledged this shortcoming.  Finally, you note I answered the only question she actually asked, and if you read and understood my answer, the products she's asking about are most likely the same, not a dilute or pure version.	2016-01-15 17:31:48Z	Atl LED
4365	4405	@user19679 I disagree as a mater of fact.  The question "Are these the same, just different marketing?" is directly answered by my post.  I'm willing to entertain that the question should be marked as off-topic as such.  Further the question "If not, which should I use?" is also answered because the products are likely the same, for the reasons listed.	2016-01-15 17:41:02Z	Atl LED
4365	4405	@user19679 yes, you do in fact, need to say more. Or rather, the OP does. Just adding a tag to a question does not suddenly change the question.	2016-01-15 18:38:55Z	YviDe
4365	4405	For what's it worth, I strongly believe there's just no difference at all in the two solutions the OP bought. Both contain 14 percent alcohol, and since it's impossible for there to be more than 100 percent in there, the rest is witch hazel.	2016-01-15 18:40:22Z	YviDe

4294	5187	"The current evidence suggests that at least the PPIs should no longer be prescribed, except to prevent intestinal bleeding"  does it really?

4294	5187	@YviDe My interpretation, that's why I used the word "suggests". The point is that now that there is solid evidence that it is implicated in severely adverse health outcomes that can lead to death,the calculus about its proper use will change. See also here: " it has become equally clear that they should be used when needed and not continued indefinitely when there is no clear indication. —Neil Skolnik, MD"	2016-03-24 17:48:07Z	Count Iblis
4294	5187	"PPI's should no longer be prescribed, except to prevent intestinal bleeding" This is non sense. PPI's are still prescribed for various condition. Patients which take NSAID's, have barrettes, reoccurring ulcer, reoccurring gastritis, have displasyia, have heartburn daily (GERD), have a hiatal hernia, have Zoolynger-Elyson  etc. are all patients who are basically on them for life. Those studies do not say that PPI's cause the above side effects it just correlation. People have been taking them for 30 years and are doing fine.

4272	4275	It's not uncommon to write for blood to be drawn (and tested somewhere) when a patient is symptomatic, so you're on target with that advice (it need not be done at the doctor's office, but at any outpatient blood-drawing facility.) There are many things that can cause symptoms but not show up in blood work an hour later (or even when symptomatic) e.g. atrial fibrillation can come and go, be symptomatic and completely unsuspected by the patient, but not show up in a blood test.	2016-01-03 05:40:16Z	anongoodnurse

4249	4252	Different doctors will have different opinions. Believe me when I say another doctor will prescribe you Ritalin. If Ritalin is not effective there are other options: amphetamine, atomoxetine, other antidepressants, etc.The fact that your doctor is not helping you with something that is clearly bothering you is ridicious. There are so many medications you can try, you  will find one that helps you. If your doctor won't help you then find another. In regards to the depression, again a psychologist and medication can help with both. Indeed: You should consult a doctor about this.	2015-12-31 05:08:02Z

4242	5209	EMS protocols are almost always local policy decisions, although quite often "local" means at the state level. There are no national EMS protocols in the US. That said, the death of the backboard is long overdue and has been in the discussion phase since the 1990s. There is no evidence showing they are helpful and significant evidence showing they are harmful.	2016-03-22 19:38:23Z	Carey Gregory
4240	4241	Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, that's just how I would read a result like this, and I have seen that notation used elsewhere (C1 to C7, for example)	2015-12-30 14:16:45Z	YviDe
4240	4241	Thank you. I guess you are right, however, I think the sentence could be structured more clearly e.g. bulging of posterior discs C3 to C7.	2015-12-30 17:56:53Z	
4240	4241	Well, it did say "C3 to C7", not "C3 and C7".	2015-12-30 20:31:12Z	Nic Hartley
4240	4241	@YviDe - Yes, that is clearly what was meant; it's not ambiguous. C3 to C7 is inclusive, and quicker to say than "the discs of C3/4, C4/5, C5/6 and C6/7." The former is the typical way radiologists report results. The OP may be thinking that the bulging disc is so out there that it stretches to the C6/7 space. But this is not how it works.	2015-12-30 20:47:37Z	anongoodnurse

4176	4186	The doctors in the hospital told me that my whatever I had had nothing to do with her yeast infection. I don't know what was in the IV bottles, but if they diagnosed a tonsillitis, they probably gave me antibiotics. Or is it just a coincidence and it really was just a bad tonsillitis?	2015-12-26 00:00:06Z	
4176	4186	It could be coincidence but it could also be related.  Hard to tell without a swab from both parties to see what the infection was.  Also could be viral.  I guess the important question is are you feeling better? If not seek help.  And hopefully the above explanation and references help give you an idea to what yeast infection is and how it can be transmitted.  I've added extra information on what tonsils, which may clarify a few things.	2015-12-26 18:31:20Z	pandoraEudora
4176	4186	Yes, I feel better - it's been a month since then. The strange thing is that oral antibiotics from my doctor didn't do anything, but once they hooked me up on IV in the hospital, it got better within a few days. Maybe they gave me anti fungi medicine, I'll ask them.	2015-12-26 18:33:14Z	
4176	4186	Good! It could have been anti-viral, such as Acyclovir.	2015-12-26 18:39:33Z	pandoraEudora

Even though in Germany, health care is paid, the job seems to be done as soon as the patient doesn't suffer anymore. Diagnosis and related facts are often ignored. That's when I switched general practitioner and that's why I inform myself additionally to doctor's statements, always.	2017-03-12 19:59:18Z

Most of the research on shift work is on people doing it for years, not, for example, on people doing this a few days and never again, or students who spend a few nights learning for exams, or people temporarily using medication that causes insomnia.

That was, in my opinion, a great question to assess a chronic illness)	2015-12-26 19:54:22Z	
4169	4197	Oh, also very interesting, thanks. I especially like the question in the linked document "At what number is the pain at an acceptable level for you?" A very helpful question in those situations.	2015-12-26 20:13:58Z

4143	4148	Cool, but is hypoactivity by mediation really good. Don't I want my brain to be functioning? Sorry if it sounds really silly. My reasoning is that a brain that is active is better than one that is inactive because an inactive brain is not being used to its true potential.	2015-12-22 01:54:48Z

4125	5084	I agree with @CareyGregory . The OP references specific studies and asks how "these studies" do it,  so a discussion as to how those studies do it would be much more helpful.	2016-03-10 19:27:47Z	YviDe
4125	5084	Alright, so I extended the answer a little - I'm sure it's still not satisfying for you, but I find this exercise sort of pointless, since all this information is in the actual link the OP already provided...	2016-03-10 23:20:14Z	Chris
4125	5084	In all fairness, the OP's question is basically a request for an explanation of the statistical methods employed to answer broad questions like this. Since a "good" answer to such a question would fill a chapter in a stats textbook and that's not feasible here, your edits are sufficient for me to reverse my downvote. My complaint with your first answer was it simply made no attempt to provide detail.\	2016-03-11 00:22:44Z	Carey Gregory

4041	4177	Thank you for your answer, I'll look into the BfArM. I'm afraid this leaves me with a few follow up questions - I already knew about the frequency names, but as far as I know, very rarely do drugs get tested on the number of patients you'd need to determine a rare/very rare side effect, so where do these come from? If all side effects listed just come from clinical trials, what happens if one is rare and only shows up once the drug is used on a larger scale?	2015-12-26 08:02:51Z	
4041	4177	I think clinical trials can vary in sample size, but the statisticians and epidemiologists engaged in structuring such trials know at the onset how many patients they need to test to derive the statistical significance they need to determine the safety and efficacy of a drug.  As far as reaching into the rare and very rare levels, clinical trials probably are often not that large.  But, FDAs and the BfArM, I believe do get pharmaceutical companies to keep on tracking such drugs once sold to the entire population.  And, that's how rare and very rare effects are detected.	2015-12-26 19:49:25Z	Sympa
4041	4177	To answer your question what happens if one is rare and only shows up once the drug is used on a large scale?  I think either the drug gets removed from the market, or its label get revised to fully disclose those rare and very rare side effects.	2015-12-26 19:53:42Z	Sympa
4041	4177	FYI the studies don't always compare the drug to placebo for side effects. I am in a study comparing side effects for two different doses of a drug (the similar effectiveness of the two doses was already established by an earlier study.)	2017-05-21 14:49:17Z	Kate Gregory

I personally feel like they push the "reference" policy way too far; and end up discouraging people from exchanging valuable information.  On the other hand, it is hard to argue that health answers that are readily interpreted as health advice (whether they should or not) are inherently a lot more dangerous in terms of their implications than other answers.  So, the "reference" bit is not a bad safeguard after all.	2015-12-29 23:18:54Z	Sympa

4023	10447	Ubiquitous Student (love your moniker!), the symptoms given in the image for hypothyroidism isn't completely right. Symptoms listed are found more with congenital hypothyroidism and/or more severe cases. It's true that cold pale dry skin is often one of the first physical change that may be detected but it's not always true for all individuals with hypothyroidism. I'm a case in point. When my hypothyroidism had worsened for an unknown reason after being treated and stable for years, my TSH level was 23.59 - no error was made either.	2017-07-03 00:20:54Z	Jude
4023	10447	But even with my TSH that high, I was never cold nor was my skin dry. My mind was very foggy which worried me and I was always tired and lethargic. But my heart rate was around 80 bpm at rest. The only difference I noticed is I wasn't as bothered by the heat as usual during summer (and our summers are quite mild compared to most places). I'm considerably warmer than most women and I like cool temperatures. Only during sleep do I like being warm. I had hair loss - pretty bad actually - but my scalp and facial skin still stayed oily, just less than usual for me.	2017-07-03 00:27:34Z	Jude

4006	4422	The most interesting part is that about 90% of cancers appear after age 45. Which was why I actually asked the question; I wanted visitors to see that below that age their cancer risks are much lower, so that they are not that worried that they ll get cancer when they are young. (maybe emphasizing it would be helpful to them).	2016-01-17 11:47:10Z	
4006	4422	An interest[ing] effect, [...] 0-30 and steadily decreasing from there. - I am not so sure about this. If you are referring to the data at page 13, the difference in risk looks negligible before age 60. However, it does become non negligible after age 60 (probably for the reason you mention).	2016-01-17 12:59:13Z	
4006	4422	@Fermiparadox Hm, the link is bringing me to the first page. Regarding your last comment: I perhaps misrepresented the trend. I was trying to show that there is a peak at age 30. You're right, though, that the differences are pretty much negligible in that area.	2016-01-17 15:12:40Z	HDE 226868
4002	4844	Hmm, your source cites bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/4/597.full , which is only a case report of one patient and is mostly about how it's dangerous to inject H2O2 into a "vascular closed cavity", which the original question isn't asking about. I don't think it supports the assertion that H2O2 "slowi[s]the healing process down. It causes damage to your own cells", though I admit I haven't read it too closely.	2016-02-16 12:25:05Z	YviDe

3995	4036	while you're not saying that pulmonary fibrosis is caused by not doing breathing exercises, you at least say that it could be prevented by doing them.

3986	4030	Hello and welcome to Health.SE. This site requires sources for statements in answers meta.health.stackexchange.com/questions/1/… you can provide any for genital skin having a different kind of melanin than skin in other regions, this would be a good answer. Again, welcome to the site!	2015-12-11 07:28:08Z	YviDe
3986	4030	This is a pretty good answer. If you could just cite some source(s), we can give you upvotes, and those who downvoted may even flip!	2016-01-31 21:11:24Z	Dave Liu
3980	5143	This is not what am asking for. I'm asking for the  conditional probability.  Of course the cancer risk depends on dosage. But how does the information that a person had ARS change the probability for him to get cancer?	2016-03-23 09:22:29Z	
3980	5143	Like I said, you can not accurately estimate the dose given only the symptoms. But using the rough values you can know the dose in Sievert. Then it is simple to calculate the probability of getting cancer, as the unit Sievert directly correlates with this chance.	2016-03-23 11:53:33Z	jiggunjer
3980	5143	But that is not the conditional probability. You are talking about P(A) while i'm talking about P(A|B)	2016-03-23 14:02:05Z	
3980	5143	Which in this case is the same. You're asking what the chance is, given a person had ARS. That is exactly the same as asking what the chance is, given an exposure to a dose of X Sievert. The fact that a person also had acute symptoms should not affect the long term effect.	2016-03-24 01:42:15Z	jiggunjer
3980	5143	Now I see your point. But does the dose really fully determine whether someone gets ARS without any randomness involved? I mean there has to be some gray area where some people don't get sick while others would not even if they were exposed to the same radiation dose.	2016-03-24 10:06:41Z	
3966	3968	Do you mean that it will never be inherited if only one parent is carrier?	2015-12-05 14:42:30Z	
3966	3968	@JasonStack yes. In strictly "recessive autosomal" inheritance, both parents need to be carriers	2015-12-05 14:43:44Z	YviDe
3966	3969	Thank you. What are R and r short for and how early into pregnancy can prenatal diagnosis take place?	2015-12-05 14:50:21Z	
3966	3969	r and R are not really short for something, R represents the healthy dominant allele, and r the mutated recessive allele. You need two r and no R to express the pathology. The diagnosis can be made by sterol analysis on a chorionic villus sample, which is generally done around 10-13 weeks. Results usually come within 1-2 weeks in my experience.	2015-12-05 14:57:48Z	Denn
3966	3969	So, the test you talked about is different from that mentioned in the question? That is because it has been taken in 18th week, done by taking blood sample, but I am not sure what the test name is.	2015-12-05 15:14:11Z	
3966	3969	I think they're different tests, yeah. I'm a bit confused as to what kind of SLO test can be done on maternal blood, though. Maybe something like this study, but as far as I know it's not the routine test? Or maybe the mother's had abnormalities in her hormonal blood tests, but it's not something doctors will normally search for, especially at the 18th week. Are you sure there was no amniocentesis?	2015-12-05 15:23:21Z	Denn
3966	3969	yes, amniocentesis has not been done, though the doctor recommended it, but it seems to be lengthy as Wikipedia says, "Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling leave very little time to make this decision (abortions become more difficult as the pregnancy advances), and can also pose severe risks to the mother and baby." Will amniocentesis, in your opinion, ensure the diagnosis?	2015-12-05 15:33:39Z

3950	3954	Can you please add sources for a few of your statements (vaporizer effects, at least).  Also, while you say that a doctor should be consulted (which they should!), I feel like you didn't take into account that the OP was asking specifically about bleomycin, which damages the lungs. The other people you heard about might have taken different medication. Even a vaporizer might be a very, very bad idea in this case.	2015-12-04 17:39:35Z	YviDe
3950	3954	@YviDe I could not find a clear source for effects but since it follows a similar path as smoking (through the lungs) i have tried to make that as clear as possible. I leave the part open about bleomycin because that is outside of my knowledge. If OP wants to be 100% sure i think he is better of taking small amounts of edibles to see where his comfort zone is.	2015-12-05 10:08:45Z	Jeroen Ubbink

3942	3959	Thank you. I should have maybe put the emphasis in my question more on low carb and not strictly ketogenic. I am aware this is a bit vague but i'd just like to keep the carbs low and the fat higher so i specifically don't have to get low fat products which i am advised by the clinic now because she might get too heavy because the rest of her diet has so many carbohydrates in them. Also giving severely higher risk to diseases like type 2 diabetes... However I find your answer very thorough andit's food for thought. I don't expect an exact answer out of my question.	2015-12-04 17:49:20Z	
3942	3959	@JeroenUbbink I think a thing to remember, though, is that your daughter might not actually want to eat what you want her to eat - milk is sweet and tastes close to breast milk and formula, so there's usually no problem getting children to get their calories and calcium from that. By all means, offer her a varied diet! You'll probably keep her away from the sweets, which is good :-) Just don't get overboard - while I get that you are concerned and want her to start with healthy habits, type 2 diabetes doesn't usually develop in one year olds who eat too much rice :-)	2015-12-04 17:53:30Z	YviDe
3942	3949	I would be much more emphatic in this important answer. If you can expand, it would be very helpful.	2015-12-04 06:15:34Z	anongoodnurse
3942	3949	Thanks for your feedback. Even though these things do worry me i find that the study that resulted in poor bone development did not do anything to counter the lower intake on calcium from the eliminated dairy products. At least it doesn't say so, only that it was 'suboptimal'.   The side effects listed on the other site have no statistics on how often they appear. Also these are things I (as an adult) am already familiar with and know how to combat.  So even though i now have some more research entry points i find the 'facts' stated on these sites mediocre at best.	2015-12-04 07:46:18Z	
3942	3949	@Joeren at the very least, they got supplementary calcium: "All children were supplemented with one multivitamin with minerals (at a vitamin D concentration approximately recommended for age) and additional calcium and phosphorous at recommended intake for age" - "The decline in BMC occurred despite prescribed vitamin D and calcium supplementation and with a reduction in the number of AEDs used."	2015-12-04 08:54:37Z	YviDe
3942	3955	What i do not understand is what you mean that it will be one-sided. It is a misconception that a ketogenic diet is onesided. The things that are the most important to keep an eye on (for adults at least) are calcium, potassium and magnesium. You can eat almost all the vegetables, all the meat and you have to pay attention to your water intake (should be a more than 2 liters spread out over the day). I am probably more aware of micronutrition than any average person on a 'normal' diet. The question remains if i can replace carbs with fat. I like you comment about glucose for the brain. Source?	2015-12-04 17:39:05Z	
3942	3955	Glucose for brain: my physiology class, any physiology textbook and the wikipedia article I quoted.	2015-12-04 17:52:03Z	Thawn
3942	3955	@JeroenUbbink - Glucose is the preferred substrate for energy for all body systems. The body turns to fat only when glucose is not available, which is why it takes so much work to stay in ketogenesis. I'll spare you my opinions on the efficacy of such an undertaking :)	2015-12-04 17:56:28Z	JohnP
3942	3955	@JohnP you are right in general. For any tissue (ie muscle, etc.) Glucose is the fastest available source for energy. However, for the brain this is much more severe: Neurons almost exclusively metabolise glucose. This is believed to protect them from oxidative stress and slow down ageing because glucose metabolism (glycolysis) does not require oxygen.	2015-12-04 18:05:29Z	Thawn
3942	3955	One-sided diet: any diet that tries to leave out one of the three main energy sources (carbohydrates, protein, fat) is by definition one-sided. This does not mean that eating a lot of vegetables is bad (on the contrary). But leaving out carbohydrates (or protein or fat) entirely is not a good idea.	2015-12-04 18:11:17Z	Thawn
3940	11099	An EMT won't hesitate to look for a pendant on an unconscious woman. She needs help more than modesty. But for the first aid-level of first responder, there's not much that's going to be on that pendant that would change your course of action, so it may be wise to skip that step unless you're wearing something that clearly identifies your status as a first responder.	2017-02-09 16:42:18Z	Carey Gregory
3940	11099	@CareyGregory - I'm sure your right.  Of course, as a first responder, I'd be looking to maintain the patient's dignity for anything other than use of an AED (and if there was an AED qualified female first aider on hand, I'd hand that over).  With a case of hypoglycaemia, I'd hope to get there before a coma set in and offer the "quick win" solution.  An unresponsive patient would get a clear airway and an ambulance as a matter of course.	2017-02-09 17:52:00Z	Snow
3940	11099	If you need a defib then all decorum gets tossed. Whoever's closest gets that chest exposed and the bra cut off -- now. It doesn't matter who does it or who the witnesses are. Really.

3906	3936	A short summary in your answer of the relevant parts in the cited articles would go a long way in making this a good answer. Right now it's bare bones and requires a lot of legwork on the part of the reader.	2015-12-05 06:49:01Z	anongoodnurse
3905	3977	Should the percentages be added or "multiplied"? E.g. a male could get both prostate(15%) and lung(7.5%) cancer; therefore, his odds of not getting any of those would be (1 - 0.15)*(1 - 0.075) = 78.6% or 21.3% of getting any of those. If we added the percentages instead, it would be 22.5%.	2015-12-07 10:19:36Z	
3905	3977	Yes, generally, you are totally right and I missed that. However, talking about something relative "reduces cancer risk by about 40 percent"  (or the 38 and 35 in my answer) that shouldn't matter. Talking about overall lifetime risk you are totally right, though.	2015-12-07 19:00:02Z	YviDe
3905	3977	Assuming cancer types are not mutually exclusive we get 33% (the method in my example) which isn't that different from 38% (the method you used). Besides, now that I think of it, the true value might be somewhere in between those 2 figures, since some cancer types being very aggressive would practically make them "mutually exclusive" in a way.	2015-12-09 12:20:04Z	
3905	3977	Just came across this old question in research, great set of links you've provided. I feel compelled to point out though that you've confused incidence with risk and that can be very misleading. Where the cause is unknown, the "incidence" of a cancer related to a lifestyle factor will be zero because one cancer will be recorded and no link will be made. The "risk", however, that the cancer is caused by lifestyle factors is 50% (i.e it could be or could not be, we don't know). If you treat all the unknowns as 50% I imagine your figures for "risk" would be considerably higher.	2017-05-08 10:40:00Z	Isaacson
3904	3928	Wikipedia is tricky to use as a reference. Often their information is unsupported by any references, or are based on mis(interpretations/representation) of references. Your wiki article bases its sources of tryptophan in food on two articles, one about cocoa powder's addictive effects on smoking (!) and another links to the general USDA Ag Research Service page. Also, note [3] is based on very small numbers and the effects were (probably) unrelated to diet (the results and conclusions drawn are confusing.) That's just two. :( Thanks.	2015-12-02 09:24:52Z	anongoodnurse
3904	3928	@anongoodnurse that second citation is how citations to ndb.nal.usda.gov are supposed to look. To me, that looks like a good source for the nutritional data in that table...	2015-12-02 09:34:39Z	YviDe
3904	3928	That's not the link I was directed to from the Wiki reference. (?) The Wiki link ([22] in section 4) is ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=80-40-05-25.	2015-12-02 09:45:08Z	anongoodnurse

3881	3890	I think we actually only have ophthalmologist here in Germany. So I can put this answer into context: Are eyesight measurements only done by doctors in France? I ask because I have never seen a doctor for that and thus think it's strange to go see a doctor "just" for that.	2015-11-29 17:04:49Z	
3881	3890	@YviDe It's probably a cultural thing, what is medical and what is paramedical varies a lot according to where you live. Optometrists exist here (although they're very rare) but they aren't recognized so, like opticians, they can do eyesight measurements but you won't get reimbursed by social security if you don't have a prescription (which is only valid 3 years) from an ophthalmologist . So in practice you go to the doctor, get your prescription, go to the optician who will often adjust it, and then you have your glasses/lenses. This could change in the years to come, however.	2015-11-29 17:43:22Z	Denn
3867	3869	"If the person was infected in utero, then they are likely to carry the parasite" do you have a citation for this kind of lifelong infection?	2015-11-27 15:23:29Z	YviDe
3867	3869	@YviDe This is an example of recommendations for the follow-up of children infected in utero. There's also the case of patients presenting an immune deficiency that will make the previously asymptomatic infection by Toxoplasma gondii turn into an active infection. Source	2015-11-27 15:41:38Z	Denn
3867	3869	I'm sorry, I don't see how that first paper supports this? There's a lot in there about how to treat pregnant women who get infected and how to treat newborns who were exposed in the womb, for both the active infection (if they are still infected at birth) and the effects that infection had, but nothing about them still carrying the parasite well into adulthood when they could be donating blood	2015-11-29 14:01:16Z	YviDe
3867	3869	Toxoplasma gondii forms cysts in tissue while in their latent phase (bradyzoites) and that creates a latent infection that's detected via IgG levels. The study I linked to kind of presuppose that and you're right, it isn't very clear. I tried to find better: this that mentions reactivation of congenital toxoplasmosis 20 years after birth in the discussion, and this, an example of a transmission from an asymptomatic woman infected and treated 20 years ago to her newborn (for the transmission aspect)	2015-11-29 16:31:39Z	Denn

3838	3899	Your data is all based on the cause of GERD being too much acid. The theory presented is that the problem is low acid, which causes an imbalance, and not good digestion which leads to bacteria that causes the burps and that carbon dioxide from the bacteria is what's pushing acid up, and causing stress on the LES.... all this being said... I have had GERD for years, took the PPI (which state do not take for more than 2 weeks). i was miserable and started having problems with digestion and mineral absorption. taking Betaine HCL stopped ALL GERD. that's real science.

3803	3805	Hi and welcome to Health.SE. Can you add more ifnormation on why you think it's a wart, and specifically one that can be treated with nitrogen? Also, I can't tell how does your last link relates to that, can you add some context? Thanks!	2015-11-23 11:01:07Z	YviDe
3803	3805	'dry crusty centre' is specific at the wart, the wart are generally on the hand or the foot is transmitted with touch with the skin or with an object. See on google image : contourderm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/… The last link is source of quote block.	2015-11-23 16:02:27Z	
3803	3805	aah, now I feel stupid about that last link ;-) don't know why I didn't get that...	2015-11-23 17:29:44Z	YviDe

3786	3788	Does this emulsion sting you upon contact ??	2015-11-20 15:37:20Z	
3786	3788	The addition of water particles will not likely affect the feeling of the application. Usually adding water to any solution makes a dilution. Dilutions' are invariably weaker than the concentrate/original solution. Dependent on the application and chemical of course.	2015-11-20 15:43:42Z	Derple

3784	11225	But they are looking for an alternative to Accutane	2017-02-20 19:58:28Z	L.B.
3777	3794	I think the terms stronger and weaker (though I agree with your answer) sort of perpetuate a misunderstanding. Maybe discuss in terms of advantages in niches? I'm not sure exactly how to address it except in that way. And the cost to the bacteria which develops an antibiotic resistance is a great point.	2015-11-21 07:38:56Z	anongoodnurse
3777	3794	@anongoodnurse tell me about it... My native language actually does translate "survival of the fittest" with "survival of the strongest" which leads to even more misunderstanding. I put the part about strong and weak being the wrong words at the beginning.	2015-11-21 07:57:35Z	YviDe
3777	3794	Ouch... that really does not fit with bacteria, does it? lol!	2015-11-21 08:17:12Z	anongoodnurse
3777	3790	Wow, nice article! Thanks!	2015-11-21 07:40:03Z	anongoodnurse
3771	3809	Thank you for your answer, tho honestly, I was especially concerned with situations where EMT is not available (for example, hunting accidents, which often happen far from civilization). I suppose, tho, that there isn't much one can do, in such a situation.	2015-11-29 14:10:10Z	
3771	3809	The first and most important thing to do is to call 911. If the gunshot wound is fatal, there won't be anything that can be done about it. If it's not an immediately or imminently fatal wound, time matters, but he'll probably live with timely intervention. If you're looking for a magic solution à la TV, there are a few things that might help, like don't make overexert himself, but common sense must prevail.	2015-11-29 22:23:15Z	anongoodnurse
3749	3750	Very comprehensive, thanks very much!	2015-11-16 16:01:24Z	
3733	3744	♦ when you say The bacteria have no opportunity to "develop resistance" while you sleep. why? What is the science behind it? Does bacteria become inactive while we sleep?	2015-11-15 13:52:17Z	
3733	3744	@Nofel - Is that a serious question? Why would the bacteria become inactive when we sleep? The answer is above. The antibiotic reaches a steady state, meaning it's still present in sufficient quantity to continue to kill the targeted bacteria while you sleep. It reaches a steady state. If you still don't how that happens after reading the edited answer above, read about pharmacokinetics. You'll understand better afterwards. But please don't just keep asking the question, or altering the dosing interval.	2015-11-15 19:38:15Z	anongoodnurse
3733	3744	So all those times as a child when my mother woke my suffering, feverish self for a 2 AM dose of antibiotic drunk with a glass of hot raspberry compote were for naught? Thank you for clearing that up, and double thanks in the name of the children I might have someday!	2015-11-15 23:36:44Z	rumtscho

3733	3744	@rumtscho, children often sleep for a lot longer then 8 hours and it depends on the antibiotic.   Most of the time it is likely you had a virus anyway and the antibiotic was not needed at all....	2015-11-16 17:41:06Z	Ian Ringrose

3696	3926	But if my eyes hurt when crossing them, isn't that my body indicating me to stop doing it?	2017-01-01 02:01:01Z	Santropedro
3694	3699	I'm new at stack exchange so not really sure about what you are asking. However, here is the CDC/ lists of studies and guidelines on the duration of antibody titers (protection against the toxin) and specifics of the tetanus vaccine. cdc.gov/tetanus/pubs-tools/publications.html  (pink book a better resource for healthcare professionals): cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html   And here is one of the many guidelines for wound management (usually common practice)  that recommends both washing with soap and water and to leave them open. bit.ly/1WRQu1I	2015-11-14 06:16:06Z	Paola
3694	3699	The recommended dose of tetanus toxoid (vaccine) is every ten years but since "In a small percentage of individuals, antitoxin levels fall below the minimal protective level before 10 years have elapsed, to ensure adequate protective antitoxin levels, persons who sustain a wound that is other than clean and minor should receive a tetanus booster if more than 5 years have elapsed since their last dose" (Taken from cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html chapter on tetanus)	2015-11-14 06:25:09Z	Paola
3694	3699	@Paola those are some good sources. Can you edit them into your answer? Also, why do you think just washing with soap and healing without band aids is better?	2015-11-14 14:00:44Z	YviDe
3694	3699	Hi again, guys. I've edited my answer, hopefully to include more details and make the reasoning clearer. Thanks for your feedback. YviDe, the band-aid part of my answer is a combination of current recommendations and my own experience as a doctor. Several patients tend to consider that the wound covered by a band-aid becomes impermeable to everything and I've seen several contaminated wounds that were not noticed because the band-aid was left in too long. With proper use (frequent change, dry conditions) they are OK, but definitely not needed in contaminated, minor or bite-type wounds.	2015-11-16 09:24:54Z	Paola
3694	3699	Hi, Paola, and welcome to the site. When people ask about answers in comments, it usually indicates that there is something in the answer that is unclear.

3688	4045	It’s worth mentioning that the point of the quoted study (which appears to be different from the linked study?) was that using caffeine in combination with methylphenidate as a treatment for “minimal brain dysfunction” (an archaic name of ADHD) can provide additional (presumably amphetamine-sparing) benefit for ADHD. One way of thinking about the effects of combining the two in people who don’t have residual ADHD symptoms is as increasing the total dose of CNS stimulant, which at some point is likely to be detrimental.	2015-12-13 22:22:13Z	Susan
3688	4045	@Susan ack, yes, that wasn't the study I wanted to link to, thanks. Too many tabs. And yes, at some point combining stimulants with similar mechanisms of action is probably going to result in some unpleasant effects. There's just no general warning or "wait at least x hours" here (and in those slow release drugs, at least the last one would be strange). Hmm, I could  to edit something in for the mechanism of action is similar... Has to wait for tomorrow, probably, though	2015-12-13 22:30:28Z	YviDe
3688	4045	YviDe, thank you :) I will read more into this later. I do ask my psychiatrist about these things, but he seems to be very busy lately. Also, I try to get second opinions.	2015-12-15 13:14:41Z	
3688	4045	Glad to hear it helped! Or might help :-)	2015-12-16 10:39:03Z	YviDe
3688	4045	"It stands to reason that at one point, combining the two can lead to nondesirable effects because of too much stimulation. " Such as? That's errr kind of what I want to know...	2015-12-23 20:50:58Z

3668	3807	Do you know the content of the stomach while it's empty? Is an empty stomach completely empty, or does it have a pool of acid in it at all times?	2015-11-24 04:26:10Z	
3668	3807	So after the food is digested the stomach pretty much remains empty until the next meal?	2015-11-24 04:41:41Z	
3668	3807	Well, yes, but if it takes 3-6 hours to digest a large amount of protein, you may be consuming your next meal while still digesting the previous. That is possible.	2015-11-24 04:44:43Z	Dave Liu
3668	3807	@DaveL when people throw up on an empty stomach, they throw up stomach acid. nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003883.htm this test is done on an empty stomach and normal results are 20 to 100 milliliters of stomach acid	2015-11-29 09:17:30Z	YviDe

3659	3669	I sure would like your otherwise good answer more if the links weren't to the NY Times. Those links are very likely to become available only to paid subscribers sometime in the (near) future. Finding the original research or at least quoting the relevant parts would be a big improvement.	2015-11-09 06:56:34Z	Carey Gregory
3659	3669	Thanks for that, Gaetan. On the basis of those studies and the ongoing controversy, I would say we can't rule out a direct link between heart disease and salt consumption, but also that the link is not well established as existing independent of blood pressure. So there's an argument that monitoring blood pressure is enough for now. Good news.	2015-11-13 01:20:02Z	
3658	3888	Wow, that guide is a really good find! I just took a quick look, and for example they actually recommend to accept donors with autoimmune hypothyroidism, asthma and mild rheumatoid arthritis. Interesting! (could you edit that in somehow, by the way? I don't want to mess with your answer, but I think it should probably be in there)	2015-11-29 16:27:08Z	
3658	3888	@YviDe Sure thing. I just added it in.	2015-11-29 16:37:38Z	HDE 226868

3631	5236	Although your answer looks factually correct and well sourced, I think it reads as overly alarming and doesn't really answer her question. The question is specifically what risk that single instance poses, not what risk continued drinking poses.	2016-04-24 16:28:34Z	Carey Gregory

3630	3654	@wordsworth - This is a valuable answer, and it's appreciated (please don't take the post notice as discouraging.)  As a physician, I agree with all of it.

3627	3628	Thanks @Gene Zhang (+1) - no certain foods do not trigger it, it comes and goes but is usually present and painful. I eat a fair amount of good healthy food and also take multi-vitamins so I highly doubt malnutrition is at play (I've also had blood panels done to confirm this). A few followup questions if you don't mind: (1) Besides this DIY "take home test" of Betaine HCL, are there any tests my GI doctor could order to test for insufficient stomach acid production?	2015-11-05 12:11:35Z	
3627	3628	Also, (2) do you know what would cause the LES to suddenly (5 months ago) start requiring more "time to retain its ability to contract and close itself in order to prevent reflux"? In other words, if its not insufficient acid production, and it is the second item you mentioned (LES dysfunction), then what might be the cause there?	2015-11-05 12:11:39Z	
3627	3628	Hi and welcome. This site requires sources which support answers We appreciate that it's a burden; consider how appreciated sources on answers to your own potential questions would be.

3627	3628	@smeeb - This is your body! Be wary of ingesting stuff without reason. Your doctors confirmed the presence of GERD. This is a random person on the internet's unsupported advice. I would humbly suggest that you wait for supporting references or read something reliable about Betaine HCL and GERD before upvoting this answer.	2015-11-05 15:01:18Z	anongoodnurse
3627	3628	Thanks @anongoodnurse (+1) - yes I would never ingest anything without an MD telling me to do so, which is why in my first comment above I am asking for what test I could ask my GI to order that might confirm this "insufficient acid production". Also, I am a member of many SE sites (most notably StackOverflow and Programmers) and it is general SE etiquette it upvote anybody who takes the time to answer your question, which is why I upvoted it. Anyone who finds this question and then blindly ingests chemicals off of Amazon without consulting their MD is a good Darwin Award candidate ;-)	2015-11-05 15:37:23Z	
3622	3674	And yet (at least according to Wikipedia), people aboard naval ships use scarce fresh water to shower. Seems odd.	2015-11-10 23:13:42Z	msh210
3622	3674	@msh210 I don't know how true that still is since modern ships distill their own fresh water from sea water. Cruise ships, for example, provide virtually unlimited fresh water to a couple thousand passengers who don't bother trying to limit their use.	2015-11-11 01:28:39Z	Carey Gregory
3622	3674	Hmm I agree with @msh210 on this one. I'm thinking about looking into this question to see if I can find some documentation of harmful exposure.	2016-01-31 21:09:47Z	Dave Liu
3622	3674	@DaveL By all means add another answer but sailors use fresh water to shower with for the simple reason that showering with seawater is unpleasant because it leaves dried salt on your skin. Anyone who's been in the ocean and then dried off without a fresh water rinse knows this.	2016-02-01 00:20:35Z	Carey Gregory

3617	3626	"The other 36 were healed with just rehabilitation." Even if I tore my ACL completely? I mean what do you mean by healed, do the ACL magically attaches itself if it was tore completely?	2017-02-24 05:05:39Z	VaTo
3617	3636	I guess I didn't quite followed. In my case I tore my ACL a little over a year ago (14 months to be exact) and I haven't gotten surgery. Am I still on time to recover or it's too late already? And if for any reason I get full recovery without surgery do I have to keep going to rehabilitation forever then?	2017-02-24 05:11:26Z	VaTo
3617	3636	@VaTo - No way to tell how recovered you are. At 14 months, it should have been completed, but the only way to tell if there is any other damage or limitations is to have an assessment done, and follow their recommendations.	2017-02-24 15:55:18Z	JohnP
3617	3636	I guess my question is, is it to late to get into physical therapy since I haven't get any kind of it? I don't think I'm recovered in any way because I still feel my knee loose and it hurts sometimes.	2017-02-24 17:42:48Z	VaTo

3619	3620	@TanMath - thanks! It is based on a review-like, but non-peer-reviewed mythbusting paper as cited above. I think most of the data pertains to meta analyses. I linked the NIH-page to the paper that includes all the references. I recommend starting from there if you need background information.	2015-11-03 03:20:18Z	AliceD

3610	3611	I might have missed something in the references you provided, but outside of an unsourced claim by WebMD that it "might"  interfere with other products (tetracycline antibiotics, levothyroxine, and Penicillamine/Cuprimine/Depen) and that it might be dangerous in excessive quantities (true for everything including water), I didn't read anything in the sourced materials that if the product actually contains colloidal silver (which apparently is not always the case) that it is dangerous.  I'm not saying it is or is not, I'm just saying I didn't read anything in your answer to indicate that it is.	2015-11-02 22:15:49Z	RockPaperLizard
3610	3611	I appreciate the answer, but the question specifically asks about the effect of size (namely 0.8 nm) to the irreversible accumulation in the tissues and organs. Is it still dangerous to consume at 0.8 nm?	2015-11-03 13:04:13Z	
3610	4527	Excellent answer, do you think you could summarize/quote the relevant sections from your links? If the links ever die, that information could be lost. Thanks! :-)	2016-01-26 17:43:11Z	JohnP

3598	3664	@CareyGregory thank you. Yes, that was my problem, too. In the end, we can't say why this hospital specifically is doing that, so I'm just guessing. It's certainly unrealistic in 2015 to think this would actually work, though,...	2015-11-08 22:07:48Z	YviDe
3598	3666	While agreeing with you that this is definitely a risk, you just made me remember that I used to take medication that had "death" listed as a rare side effect in the patient information that came with the pills. It was actually the internet that made me less scared after that (by telling me just how rare that was). A lot of knowledge with no filter can definitely be a dangerous thing for people who are scared anyway, though.	2015-11-08 22:59:22Z	YviDe

3581	3583	It would be helpful to give the actual reference with the author’s name, etc. Your link is timing out on me at the moment, and links are not necessarily reliable in the long term. Plus it’s courteous to actually name the person you’re quoting, especially if  that constitutes the majority of your answer.	2015-10-30 21:54:17Z	Susan

3556	3877	Personally, I have both fainted after a blood donation and felt close to it after getting four vials drawn on an empty stomach. But I am female ;-)	2015-11-28 14:04:34Z	YviDe
3556	3877	During my visit I weighed just 57 kilos (that made me a 127 pound 6 foot 3 inch male), and it was my first time having blood removed in any way. In the early morning, I also hadn't eaten much since the previous day, which probably answers my question	2015-11-28 14:16:46Z	
3556	3877	@LewisGoddard oh yeah, that's a low body weight for your height. Add no food and probably little to drink to that and your body will not like the blood loss.	2015-11-28 14:19:19Z	YviDe
3556	3877	Have edited the answer with a paragraph on weight in both of these studies. Adolescents and young adult men have a low weight in regard to their height quite often, I think, because they grow so fast	2015-11-28 14:24:49Z	YviDe
3556	9348	Do you have any references or evidence for your answer? I feel they would be helpful.	2016-09-24 20:37:58Z	
3556	9348	Welcome to health SE :-). Here reliable references are required to back up the answers, since they are the only way in which the community can assess the answer regardless of the reader's background. You can always edit your answer to add some. Thanks!	2016-09-27 00:51:13Z	Lucky
3549	11054	In addition... If you don't blow isn't excess drainage swallowed thus causing upset stomach?	2017-06-06 21:43:50Z	Christy B.
3549	11054	that would vary person by person, it's by no means guaranteed that it would upset anyone's stomach. If it did, though, I don't know that anyone would interpret that as "I'm not over my cold yet" which was the question here.	2017-06-06 21:46:59Z	Kate Gregory
3548	3485	Thanks very much, It is exactly what I'm suffering from. Could it be dangerous? something like tumor.	2015-10-21 19:26:20Z	
3548	3485	Reading the sources provided should reassure you that in the majority of cases, this is a benign condition, but don't trust me: read and become informed!	2015-10-21 19:35:38Z	anongoodnurse
3545	3547	Note that "more contaminants" here doesn't mean they are coming from outside, but still the old contaminants. It's just the lost of water makes the contaminants more concentrated.	2015-10-28 07:34:46Z	Ooker
3545	3547	That concentration argument is of course correct but depending on the equipment used: that can actually add new contaminants if heated water is allowed to leach them out over a prolonged time. Note that I am talking mainly about plastics/metals used that aren't properly called fit for food grade applications. But some manufacturers or sellers are sinners in this regard. Using fresh water mitigates that risk a bit  – and tastes better.	2017-09-16 13:28:50Z	LangLangC
3545	3547	And depending on the interval time between boils: if there is enough food for microbial growth in the initially boiled water those germs might start producing tosinx that then might be not destroyed by boiling anew. Although that time frame and state of the water initially used is unlikely in an infant feeding situation.	2017-09-16 13:33:36Z	LangLangC
3535	3539	Thank you for a detailed answer. I will try reading about coping with OCD and if it doesn't help, well, it's time to visit a therapist. Also I want to metion that I thought of a reward strategy, basicly "if I manage to clean my teeth under 10 minutes I will buy myself a cake (just an example)" but unfortunately the compulsion was stronger than trying to get a reward.	2015-10-26 21:56:35Z	
3535	3539	ufrgs.br/toc/images/artigos_de_interesse/…  This commentary by the same author might be informative in further reading as well.	2016-02-11 01:04:51Z	Dave Liu
3535	3537	Thank you for answering, but I don't think it will help because I know that a part of mouth is already cleaned, but the compulsion still forces me to clean it again no matter what.	2015-10-26 22:00:10Z	
3525	3540	Is it a coincidence to see so many different hemorrhagic fevers listed here?	2015-10-26 22:18:50Z	Count Iblis
3525	3540	It only gnawed the skin. There was no bleeding. Can these disease be transmitted through this.	2015-10-27 02:20:44Z	
3525	3540	@AbhishekAgrawal Yes. Merely being in close proximity to the rodents is sufficient for some diseases. They can be transmitted by urine and feces, and the dust that occurs when feces dry up.	2015-10-27 04:20:37Z	Carey Gregory
3525	3540	@CountIblis It is interesting how many hemorrhagic diseases are listed. Maybe that's the rat's revenge for warfarin.	2015-10-28 18:12:18Z	Carey Gregory
3524	14672	This has the beginnings of a good answer, but here on Health.SE we tend to like scientific answers. I'd recommend an edit to indicate this as a case study, and perhaps a few more sources to back the data presented about said case study. The fact that someone can survive for one year on only potatoes is a fairly good indication that the premise in the question is correct, but it needs a bit of help (sources!) to really be Health SE material.	2017-12-13 21:14:27Z	TheEnvironmentalist
3522	3541	@anongoodnirse I am pleased and excited to let you know that she has delivered a cute and healthy baby daughter. Although, she has delivered the baby but she herself is still in intensive care for low platelets. I really appreciate thank you for your interest and concern to look into this issue. May God bless you and wish you best of luck in your nursing profession. :)	2015-10-29 06:36:06Z	
3522	3541	@MuhammadMaqsoodurRehman - I am so very happy to hear that! Thank you for letting us know. We are all blessed by the news!	2015-10-29 06:43:10Z	anongoodnurse
3515	3519	Thanks for answering. Okay, I'm glad to hear that deos are safe. But do they darken my underarms?	2015-10-25 13:52:40Z	
3515	3519	All the information regarding deodorants darkening your underarms area come from the so-called beauty websites. I can not tell you, scientifically, that deodorants darken your underarms, although that is something that is quite popular in beauty websites. Some of these suggest deodorants which do not cause underarms darkening. I will not provide links, because I don't see beauty websites as a valid source for information.	2015-10-25 14:27:00Z	Executer
3515	3519	I'm going with you; thanks for the assurance:)	2015-10-25 14:34:33Z	
3514	3707	Please tell me if this doesn't answer your question - I searched for untreated rates, but that's kind of hard to come by, as ethically, doctors can't just let patients with angina go untreated and haven't done so for decades.	2015-11-13 10:00:32Z	YviDe
3514	3707	Thanks for a detailed answer. From where have you quoted mortality rates of "0.9%– 6.5% per annum" ? I could not find it in nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/angina .	2015-11-15 12:59:00Z	
3514	3707	@rncardio the source for that quote is "The management of stable angina" below it : bjcardio.co.uk/2011/10/the-management-of-stable-angina	2015-11-15 13:02:55Z	YviDe
3512	3544	Thank you so much for your answer!  I've up-voted your answer in hopes that you will have enough reputation to post more links.  Perhaps it would be okay if you post those links as text within your answer, by omitting the "http" protocol from them.	2015-10-27 19:01:36Z	
3511	1142	+1 for thinking alike, esp. on the part with the thirst. As @Iron Pillow also pointed out, you can drink, in a short amount of time, so many more calories and sugars than you'd probably have done with sticking to whole fruits.	2015-07-05 19:17:11Z	cirko
3511	1142	These articles compare fruit to fruit juice, not smoothies, which is a bit different than what OP asked. So far I haven't seen any studies which would show what mechanism would alter the food's GI when mixing and drinking compared to simply chewing it.	2016-08-04 07:27:46Z	Lou
3511	1142	@Lousy the mechanism is related to the speed of digestion. The less breakdown your digestive system has to do, the higher the GI. Nobody can predict the exact number, but the rule is that a whole fruit has a lower GI than a smoothie of the same fruit (because the step of breaking down cell walls is skipped) and that a juice has even higher GI than the smoothie, because the sugar doesn't have to be separated from anything else, it just gets into the bloodstream from its already-dissolved state without any more steps.	2016-08-04 10:49:35Z	rumtscho
3511	1142	@rumtscho: the rule is that a whole fruit has a lower GI than a smoothie of the same fruit - that's exactly the rule I would like to see backed up. Also, many sites claim that "breaking cell walls" (if this is even a thing, since I don't see the difference between a thoroughly chewed apple slice and the same slice blended for a couple of seconds) actually helps release more nutrients. Again, I am not saying your answer is wrong, I am just saying there should be sources regarding smoothies.	2016-08-04 11:28:14Z	Lou
3511	1454	Nice answer. Any possible links?	2015-07-04 04:54:28Z	anongoodnurse

3500	3506	This question is against the policy of this Stack Exchange as it is a question of self diagnose. Why is this being promoted and answered by you, being a moderator.	2015-11-04 15:47:11Z	Totoro

3489	3502	When you say you recommend these reads, from what perspective are you suggesting them? Medical student? College educated about biology? Layman?	2015-10-23 22:19:55Z	
3489	3502	I am a Medical Student with a great interest for neurosciences. The first two articles, by Turek et al. and Czeisler et al. are recommended in my neuroanatomy textbook and show how the light input from the retina is important in regulating the circadian cycle by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and that in the absence of this input the circadian cycle progressively switches to 25.3 hours. The review by Moore is interesting and I have read it in the past. I did not read the book, but Moore is one of the authors, so I believe you'll find it useful as well.	2015-10-24 09:13:26Z	Executer
3489	3502	Furthermore, perhaps you didn't think about it, but it's this mechanism that is also responsible for jet lag. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is usually synchronized with day and light. When you change timezones, because the clock is slow to reset (but it will, eventually), it gets desynchronized and that's why you can't sleep - it might be late, but your SC nucleus isn't synchronized with the new timezone yet. As time passes, the suprachiasmatic nucleus slowly adapts to the new timezone, thanks to the input from the retina. Article: Jet Lag (nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcp0909838)	2015-10-24 09:21:49Z	Executer
3489	3504	Personal experiences aren't really applicable to my question, unless you also shortened your time awake correlating to light and dark of the day (ie, you were inside a building that was dark for 6 hours and light for, say...10 hours). I'm looking for proportionately short or longer days, which means both your awake and sleep time proportionately change, not that you got by on sleeping less and being awake more.	2015-10-23 22:23:59Z	
3489	3504	I didn't realize you were referring specifically to how the amount of light received during the day affects your sleep, which makes my answer mute.  You might finds some answers looking into how the earth's tilt effects how long days and nights are for some locations near the poles.	2015-10-24 03:36:42Z	Gibado
3483	3485	Thanks very much, It is exactly what I'm suffering from. Could it be dangerous? something like tumor.	2015-10-21 19:26:20Z

3473	3474	From your source, an important tidbit: "There is no standard or routine screening test for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer. Screening for ovarian cancer has not been proven to decrease the death rate from the disease."	2015-10-21 01:32:00Z	anongoodnurse
3473	3474	@anongoodnurse yes, I read that. The question was still "what doctor to go to" and not "does screening make sense".. Gosh, the downvoting on this site is really out of control...	2015-10-21 04:05:45Z	YviDe
3473	3474	"How can my wife get appropriate screening\early diagnosis?" is also part of the question, and should (in my opinion) be in the answer. It has the potential to do some good. The DVs are no more out of control than the UVs, of which you've gotten many. Complaints about a rare DV are easy to dismiss.	2015-10-21 04:18:26Z	anongoodnurse
3473	3474	Thanks for the feedback everyone, its much appreciated (esp for such a sensitive subject).  @YviDe yes my wife has been diagnosed with fertility issues, PCOS and Endometriosis (all mentioned in the NBC article), and as a guy I've learned MUCH more about women's anatomy than I ever cared to =]  All interesting and helpful information however, thanks again for taking the time.	2015-10-21 12:44:50Z

3468	3472	Hi and welcome to the site. "Watching TV in a dark place for a long time may cause macula in your eye ground." makes no sense to me.

3467	3501	As a doctor who fairly frequently sees patients with bloody stool (in the Emergency Department, no less), I can assure you it is rarely difficult to determine the cause.

3449	3451	You only cite one source, which doesn't have high credibility compared to sites like WHO, .govs, and .edu addresses. This post is in danger of down-votes and even deletion.	2016-01-27 19:18:26Z	Dave Liu
3449	3451	@DaveL But this is not really health related in a positive way, the OP is doing something that is quite unhealthy while the high quality sources focus more on what is healthy. It's a bit like how it was well known among body builders that anabolic steroid work well as performing enhancing drugs  when the  official medical verdict for many decades was that its benefits were unproven. Obviously there was no easy way an official source could come up with a proof as the side effects were well known and as a result you could never get a RCT approved by an ethical committee.	2016-01-27 22:28:48Z	Count Iblis
3449	3451	Thanks for responding. Despite your explanation, the website and video-poster are not reputable. If you want to share it, I suggest including a caveat about your info source in the answer. Additionally, your 2 sentence answer is insufficient; it's not enough to point people to a link. You don't explain why carbs and fat matter, only claiming that they do, and fail to mention any mental benefits. Overall, the answer needs work to meet the site's quality standards, which is why I strongly recommend fixing it before more down-votes come along.	2016-01-28 22:37:02Z	Dave Liu

3439	3993	Maybe I'm just too tired, but I still don't get how a) these quotes can both be true "its level parallels that found in the maternal blood" and "only a small amount of the total amount of alcohol makes its way unfiltered into breast milk", and b) the same for these two "there is not a significant flow out" and "there may be little to no breakdown of alcohol in breast milk" and the quote about the levels in blood and breast milk being the same. If it doesn't 'get out' of the breast milk and into the blood, how can it diminish at the same rate of that in the blood, which goes through the liver?	2015-12-09 06:20:25Z

3429	3527	I'm extremely skeptical that EMF produced by digital devices has any significant effect on humans because they're just too low power. Changes in an EEG don't necessarily mean there will be health effects. Now, large industrial equipment and high voltage power lines may be a different matter, but the evidence for that is also weak.	2015-10-26 18:02:08Z	Carey Gregory
3429	3527	However, I don't understand the downvote.	2015-10-26 18:02:53Z	Carey Gregory
3429	3527	A few watt absorbed per kg is a huge exposure, that alone exceeds the total emitted RF power from a mobile phone by a factor of a few. Exposure of the brain to strongly pulsed fields is known to alter brain function, see e.g. here	2015-10-26 19:30:15Z	Count Iblis
3429	3527	Note that routers, WIFI etc. operate in the milliwatt range.	2015-10-26 22:15:04Z	Count Iblis
3429	3435	I'm not convinced, mostly from my own experience and those of people I know.  Plus that article is mostly OpEd and doesn't reveal much details.    powerwatch.org.uk/science/studies.asp  confirmation bias?	2015-10-17 06:03:32Z	
3429	3435	@GeneZhang Let's assume there is a nontrivial effect. Then consider doing the following experiment. We use two rooms that look identical from the inside, temperature, humidity, etc. controlled via AC is the same. The only difference is that one room is totally free of EMF, while the other room can be controlled to have arbitrary high levels of EMF. Then you do a double blind study with your patients using these rooms.    A positive result is in such an experiment a reasonable demand, but such a positive result would also be a groundbreaking result.	2015-10-17 16:13:34Z	Count Iblis
3429	3435	It would be groundbreaking, because it would imply that there are people who can sense EMF radiation. So, in principle, people who may not necessarily have any complaints, could be trained to sense whether or not their WIFI is switched on or not. With 7 billion people on Earth, it's a big red flag that there haven't already been many reports about people with such capabilities.	2015-10-17 16:23:38Z	Count Iblis
3429	3435	Even though EMF fields may not have a direct effect, they may have an effect indirectly by for example affecting the reactivity of chemicals present in a household (this is just a principle however, I am not saying that there definitely is an effect on human biology). About the effect of magnetic fields on chemical reactions, see e.g. this SE question: chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/24507/…	2015-10-26 17:01:49Z	user100487
3429	3435	@GeneZhang If one limits this to problems like poor sleep in rooms with a lot of EMF interference then we have the necessary evidence to rule out a link.	2015-11-05 16:47:34Z	Count Iblis

3420	3423	I'm not really asking about hyperkalemia but rather just increases in K+ caused by the drug that remain within normal limits. I've edited the question to clarify that you should assume normal kidney function and no other drugs being involved.	2015-10-16 01:36:21Z

3417	11631	@Shimmy well, thats fine. The question wasn't about how to prevent dandruff it was about preventing hair loss. Besides, a dry flakey scalp is usually one with less sebum, which carries the DHT. So a little dandruff might actually be a good thing	2017-03-27 22:55:10Z	Unknown Coder

3389	3461	It may be helpful to comment on how absorption would be affected by dividing the dose differently across the week. If one takes 7g of calcium at once, for instance, absorption is going to be significantly less that 1g x 7 days. I suspect the same trend is true on smaller scales (e.g. 1500 mg x1 < 500 mg x 3 days).  This is going to be affected by food, type of Ca preparation, etc., but the principle is consistent. (Contrast Vitamin D where monthly dosing achieves similar serum levels as the same cumulative around divided daily.)	2015-10-19 04:33:15Z	Susan

3384	3387	"...humans are not perfect, keeping up to date of myriad of conditions might be difficult, the medical science keeps evolving" (etc.) are not valid reasons with which to defend an erroneous answer. The problems with this answer don't lie with confused or reluctant medical professionals or the peculiarities of their patients. The problem is that either bad sources were quoted, or good ones misquoted. That will be a problem on this site.	2015-10-14 03:56:49Z	anongoodnurse
3379	3381	I find the conclusion amusing. If both real and sham surgery improved the outcome, why wouldn't the surgery still be done? Just because some physicians hate the placebo effect?	2015-10-11 10:23:42Z	rumtscho
3379	3381	@rumtscho I would imagine the real surgery carries far greater risk of complications. If the procedure is ineffective then that risk is unacceptable.	2015-10-11 14:43:31Z	Carey Gregory
3379	3381	@CareyGregory but the point is that the procedure is not ineffective, it's "not more effective than placebo". So, if it has, say, 75% chance of helping and 5% chance of complication, as a patient, I'd want it.	2015-10-11 16:07:33Z	rumtscho
3379	3381	@rumtscho But if placebo is equally effective and carries a .001% chance of complications, wouldn't you prefer that? Even if you say no, I think the problem will be for the surgeons. How do they justify that 5% risk knowing the procedure has no actual benefit above and beyond placebo, which is the usual criteria for judging effectiveness?	2015-10-11 22:01:25Z	Carey Gregory
3379	3381	The placebo effect has to be considered together with the nocebo effect. So, in the old situation where surgery was recommended you would have had a placebo effect from the surgery but also a nocebo effect from the diagnosis and the recommendation that the problem be fixed via surgery. Obviously, if you hear the news that you need surgery, then you won't have much faith in your knee getting better all by itself, you're more likely to believe that it will start to deteriorate until it gets fixed. The surgery then eliminates that nocebo and adds a placebo effect on top.	2015-10-12 05:19:33Z	Count Iblis

3370	8981	I do agree with your answer. However, I have two points: 1. your link "femoral access review" doesn't work (I think you should edit it, as there is a double http://). 2. I would also consider adding at least two other reviews, published recently (2015, 2016) in two high impact journals (Lancet and Am. J.

3333	3339	The link does work for me. You need to check if your browser has a so-called "turbo setting" which has the effect of scanning many links on the sites you visit so that any links you later click on load faster. Some servers will block agents that do this to prevent overload, particularly websites that give access to large databases will do that, see e.g. here. A trick that the arXiv site uses is a hidden IgnoreMe link, that you can't see but it's in the html code. If you visit that link, your IP address will be blocked.	2015-10-06 03:13:01Z	Count Iblis

3312	3320	On a lab result it said the detected amount was 13 but the reference range was <35 IU/mL.  Does this mean that maybe there's some other explanation for the change in reference range? Thanks	2015-10-09 04:46:35Z	
3312	3320	A bit confused: didn’t your question say that the reference range was <9 IU/mL in the result you were looking at? I’m not sure I follow your question in the comment about the change in reference range - from what to what (if not 35 to 9 as stated in the original question)?	2015-10-09 05:07:00Z	Susan
3312	3320	There were two results - in one the ref range was <9 and the other the ref range was <35.  But the measured value (which I didn't post in my original question) was 13 for the ones that had the ref range of <35 . Thx	2015-10-09 05:11:17Z	
3312	3320	Ah, I see what you’re saying. I think it’s just people choosing the degree of badness of prognosis they consider “abnormal”. The higher the titer, the higher the likelihood of progression to overt hypothyroidism.  The values between 9 and 35 are indeed associated with increased risk compared to undetectable, but there’s not a way to represent with a normal/abnormal dichotomy the fact that lower is still better than higher within the detectable range. This is why continuous variables are more informative. :-)	2015-10-09 05:16:57Z	Susan

3280	3340	although I agree with the spirit of your answer, I disagree with the strong claims you make at the beginning. See for example en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonally_transmissible_cancer	2015-10-07 14:51:39Z	rumtscho
3280	3340	Yes, thanks for the clarification.  I should have said that those two are the only two known instances of transmissible tumors in the wild.  There are a small number of additional cases where a tumor is transmissible in a laboratory setting, including newts, fish, mice, and hamsters.  However these have never been observed in the wild (there's a short review with further reading in Murchison (2009)).	2015-10-10 03:32:50Z	Hans
3280	3340	Serves me right for first responding then clicking the link.  Apparently the a third transmissible tumor in the wild was discovered this year; I was unaware of it.  Citation here.	2015-10-10 03:39:07Z	Hans
3280	3340	Thank you for updating with more explanation on transmissible tumors. I knew that they exist (well, had to look it up to refresh my memory), but did not know enough detail to be aware that none of them affect humans.	2015-10-11 10:20:13Z	rumtscho

3223	3225	Hi, neerajt, and welcome to the site. The paper you link to seems to say that the hyperinsulinemia found in PCOS makes the condition worse, hence the metformin. "In PCOS, hyperinsulinaemia has been thought to increase hyperandrogenaemia via a central role... or by decreasing the circulating levels of sex hormone binding globulin..." Your answer implies that metformin is used to prevent development of T2D. Am I misreading?	2015-09-24 20:49:06Z	anongoodnurse
3223	3225	@anongoodnurse, thank you for the nice welcome. You're right, the paper states in the introduction that hyperinsulinemia is believed to be an etiological factor in PCOS, and metformin has been tried as a treatment for PCOS itself. However, the fourth paragraph in the conclusion states that current evidence doesn't justify that purpose. It ends by stating that while the burden of judgement falls on the clinician, "Obtaining an evidence of IR [insulin resistance] is a good starting point prior to recommending its use."	2015-09-25 06:04:36Z	neerajt
3223	3225	Thanks for clearing that up! Nice answer. +1 from me. Would you be willing to edit your comment into the answer? Comments are temporary. The explanation improves your answer. Again, nice answer, and good to have you here. :)	2015-09-25 17:46:37Z	anongoodnurse

3222	3236	While I agree with your answer, there are other aspects to the OP's question. If you could address those, it would make for a better answer. Thanks. Also, while I've seen and treated many esophageal obstructions caused by food boluses, I have never (in decades of practice) seen one go to the OR (I can imagine a couple of scenarios which might make it necessary in theory, though.) Perhaps you can elaborate on this? Thanks.	2015-09-24 20:55:20Z	anongoodnurse

3215	3245	Thank you for the response. So the procedure would be to inject bone marrow concentrate to the joint instead of MSC's? There would be no need to culture or treat the bone marrow other than concentration with centrifuge?	2015-09-28 20:52:02Z	
3215	3245	@Kit That's the idea. The entire advantage of the procedure is it's simplicity and ability to be conducted with common equipment.	2015-10-28 16:43:47Z	Atl LED
3200	3753	This is a very deceptive answer. The question asks if mental disorders can cause physical ones. Your first link states the very opposite of what you state: "It used to be thought that stomach ulcers may be caused by certain lifestyle factors, such as spicy foods, stress and alcohol. There is little hard evidence to confirm that this is the case...". The second states that rheumatoid arthritis causes stress, not that stress causes arthritis.

3179	3187	Awesome answer, thank you. For the probiotics, would it be best to take those throughout her time breastfeeding as a maintenance program, rather than once she's done breastfeeding to try to catch up?  And (nearly completely) unrelated - for the drug you mentioned, is there any good way to track its progress to market? Obviously it's just in early studies now - other than catching a news tidbit in 3 years, how would I know that it is available?	2015-09-21 19:18:02Z	
3179	3187	@Drew again, it's always best to check with your pediatrician on such matters, but simply as a matter of cost, I would wait until she's finished. Real useful probiotics are not inexpensive. As far as tracking a drug to market, you can always check with a pharmaceutical company, they don't tend to keep it a secret.	2015-09-22 12:04:52Z	Atl LED

3176	3186	Based on initial study used to define cut-offs, of apparently healthy people, upper 2.5% will be said to have abnormally high BMI, while lower 2.5% will be said to have abnormally low BMI. These values can change in later studies or studies using this criteria on another population. Moreover, those with higher than normal BMI are also subcategorized into overweight, obese and morbidly obese.	2015-09-21 13:00:57Z	rncardio

In general, though, relying on links to do most of the explaining is not standard on Stack Exchange sites; an answer in your own words supported by a link is regarded as a better answer.

3161	3168	I'm glad you posted this question. I don't have near nor farsightedness, so I've never worn glasses, but a few years ago I went for a checkup and it turns out I have a slight astigmatism. Things definitely look sharper with the glasses I got, but the distortion is so severe that I never wear them. I get the trapezoid thing, and strange perspectives, like my floor or ceiling is a steep slope but also not sloped at all, in my car it feels like I'm sunken into the road (only peripherally), it's so weird. Since I don't strain without the glasses I haven't bothered replacing, but maybe I should.	2015-09-18 16:50:08Z	briantist

3130	9280	78stepshealth.us? Is this really a reliable physiology source? Never heard of it before (and I am a med student...) And their website provides a lot of information but I couldn't yet find their sources. Isn't there another reliable website/book/review you could use to support your claims? Cheers, Felipe	2016-09-17 12:50:56Z	Felipe
3130	9280	@Felipe The part in which I claim that 1.5 liters of water drunk at once is not optimal comes from my own experience as stated. To backup this claim with a scientific source I would need to find a study in which they would drunk this exact amount of water, but I didn't. The website I linked just explains how the blood volume is regulated - it's the most readable and simple source I've found. I quickly checked what they have and I did not found anything wrong - and I have finished a medical faculty.	2016-09-17 13:26:44Z	Jan
3130	9280	I am afraid. I am not convinced by your argumentation. Actually my point of telling you that I am currently a med student is that I have spent recently a lot of time studying physiology and your website wasn't known to me as a reliable physiology ressource. Telling me that you have finished a medical faculty is a very poor argument: 1. I don't think we should take your words for granted. All MD writing paper are asked to support their claims with proper referencing. I don't think it should be different here on Health SE.	2016-09-17 14:46:54Z	Felipe
3130	9280	2. Having finished medical faculty, you should be able to identify reliable sources, so I can't imagine you can't find another source. Or are you working for this website? Anyway, I don't really follow your argumentation, even in your answer. So I will downvote it. Cheers. Felipe	2016-09-17 14:48:19Z	Felipe

3112	3118	There are many studies which show efficacy of light therapy for SAD (here's one from around the time of your own paper.) In general, it is relatively easy to find one study to support a sweeping conclusion. While some studies may question the benefit of light therapy, you still can't make broad generalizations like "I can't imagine why anyone would choose phototherapy instead." That wasn't really the OP's question, either.	2015-09-14 15:17:00Z	anongoodnurse
3112	3118	then maybe you should expand on your assertion.	2015-09-15 04:46:08Z	anongoodnurse
3112	3118	@anongoodnurse The question is vitamin D production and I think the science of my first link suffices. Can you expose yourself to enough artificial UVB to produce sufficient vitamin D? Oh, I'm sure you can, but I don't know why anyone would.	2015-09-15 05:53:38Z	Carey Gregory

3108	4353	Hi there and welcome to Health.SE! This looks like it could be a really good reply, but here we require sources to back up medical statement, preferable links to peer-reviewed literature etc. Can you edit some in to support your answer? (As a new user, you can only add two links, but if you add them in comments someone else can edit for you, I think)	2016-01-11 08:42:26Z	YviDe

3149	3166	+1, thanks. You say that high doses can be addictive.  are there studies on this?	2015-09-18 06:35:11Z	
3149	3166	I will see what I can find for primary sources, but here's a generic reference. To help the lay prospective I will reword that to habit forming.	2015-09-18 12:28:40Z	Atl LED
3149	3166	In your reference they call it B6 dependency.  Any idea how serious this is?	2015-09-18 12:41:34Z	
3149	3166	Well in the worse case you're talking about seizures from withdrawal, but that isn't too likely. You would want to get with a physician and work out a step down program.	2015-09-18 17:36:36Z	Atl LED
3149	3166	@draks... Here is a good compilation of effects from B6 toxicity.  I'm still going over primary lit and found plenty of examples of lowered concentrations following prolonged use, and as in that link, plenty on where it can go wrong with taking to much.  The article that has 33 day dependency is from a journal that doesn't electronical archive back to 1985 when it was published, so I'm going to see if I can get my hands on a print copy.	2015-09-19 02:17:14Z	Atl LED

3090	3091	So it just comes to a lot of fats plus carcinogens? But the fats from the oil are just as bad in salads, right? Or is the fried oil especcially bad if carcinogens excluded?	2015-09-10 17:10:27Z	
3090	3091	@German the process of heating of oils at high temperature during frying causes production of carcinogens. You also don't use a lot of oils in salads (and usually use olive oil which is better than some oils used for frying)	2015-09-10 17:11:34Z	WYSIWYG

Here references are strongly encouraged and answers without them are at risk of being deleted. Furthermore, the link between wearing the mouthguard  and preventing quad injury is very far fetched and it needs reliable references to prove it.	2016-02-05 17:13:58Z	Lucky
3089	4648	Yeah I had this is mind when answering as I usually like to give references but I was so happy to have found a solution. I will ask my physiotherapist, I couldn't find anything online with a quick search. Also, readers should note that the exercises I was given were the main reason for the solution to my imbalance while the mouthguard was important.	2016-02-05 19:18:59Z

3069	3092	I’m not looking for support and I didn’t make any proposal. I merely suggested two possible alternative treatments that have been used, but not researched fully. There are others I have found, but figured that listing a couple would imply that there may be many possibilities. I didn’t ask why these possibilities are bad. I asked why we stick with something with known risks rather than looking for something better, when other options are obviously still unexplored.	2015-09-11 06:59:25Z	
3069	3092	If I understand it correctly your answer to why there is not more effort made to enhancing ET function is that the function is complicated, full length stents would be bad, and the solution of ear tubes mimics the worst case scenario solution that the body naturally produces so… (and you didn’t state) so I’ll take the implication that no further attempts to improve ET function should be investigated despite being present? That doesn’t really answer my question.	2015-09-11 06:59:40Z	
3069	3092	“Finally, you are mistaken that there are no attempts to treat (improve) ET dysfunction. There are surgical procedures available for those with severe ETD.” I never even implied that there were no attempts to improve ET function, I merely asked why there were not more. Your answer approaches this entire question from a disaster point of view. The surgical procedures are for severe ETD. My question implies a wellness point of view. Improving function early so that it never gets to emergency levels.	2015-09-11 07:00:08Z	
3069	3092	Why you wouldn’t address the idea of balloon inflation is beyond me. It’s an alternate version of a valsalva maneuver with no serious risk that I’m aware of. There’s no surgery, and it is currently used as an effective treatment in some areas. See also, the Otovent. The procedure is supposed to temporarily open the ET and may allow it to drain. I just don’t have enough research on the topic to know the veracity of the idea. Here is the cochrane review from 2013 that came to the same conclusion that I did that there is not enough evidence. bibliotecacochrane.com/pdf/CD006285.pdf	2015-09-11 07:00:25Z	
3069	3092	Another thing that hasn't been researched fully: the efficacy of parachutes in prevention of death by jumping out of airplanes. The worst case scenario of chronic otitis media is death, not TM perforation, which is common and usually very benign. As to balloon inflation, you're correct, it's a common (and old) trick for older kids. (Because you mentioned it with stents , I mistakenly assumed you were speculating about something different.) My apologies for that. Regarding that, ear infections most commonly occur in babies and toddlers who can't blow up a balloon (there goes that idea.) ...	2015-09-11 07:08:28Z	anongoodnurse
3068	3076	How about nuts? Is raisins better than nuts?	2015-11-23 06:31:16Z	Cary Bondoc
3068	3076	@CaryBondoc I think that nuts are also fine (especially without additional salt). My guess is that raisins would make you fill fuller more quickly, whereas nuts would keep feeling full for longer (because raisins are a fruit and have a lot of carbohydrates and nuts are seeds and in addition to carbs contain protein and unsaturated fats).	2015-11-26 19:45:08Z	Lucky

3101	3103	That study was done with mice. While not making it void, it's a bit of a stretch to USE UPPER CASE and clearly state that artificial sweeteners are not healthy for a human being, since the evidence clearly does not support that as anything more than a speculation.	2015-09-08 06:49:33Z	radpin
3101	3103	You may take another look at the study: "[...] To compare relative species abundance, we mapped sequencing reads to the human microbiome project reference genome database [...]". The study indicates, that artifical sweeteners have a negative effect on human glucose metabolism. Because there is no need to use artifical sweeteners and they have no explicit positive effect on human health, I conclude: They are not explicitly healthy, they are (in moderate dosages) not deadly and they may induce health issues, which is supported by scientific studies like the mentioned one.	2015-09-08 07:26:47Z	
3101	3103	While there are well founded objections to the strength of conclusions of this study, the scientific community does agree that the results are interesting and deserve further follow-up research. Rome wasn't built in a day, nor was any important scientific concept proven in a single study. While one diet coke isn't likely to cause a lethal outcome, this study is a good find and keeping an eye on future studies is a good idea, IMO.	2015-09-18 13:30:46Z	Lucky
3049	3050	The character seems to have gone from shooting up to sleeping to being hit by a car to being in the hospital to being at home with no other substances along the way, except whatever he may have gotten in the hospital.  The seizure happened about two or three days after his last dose heroin, and he wasn't in withdrawal until then, so either the show is being unrealistic or the hospital gave him something to tide him over and ward off withdrawal for a while.  He was raving when he arrived at the hospital, so they restrained him, and I assume they would have administered sedatives.	2015-09-07 15:37:28Z

3046	3051	Thank you for your input @JohnP, In fact that kind of studies are the ones that make many people buy and ingest collagen, but I can't understand why it is effective. My question is focused on how can this be physically possible (I'm not saying it isn't, I just would like to understand it).	2015-09-08 02:29:24Z	
3046	3051	I don't know the mechanism of action for it. The second study lists several studies that corroborate the efficacy of collagen, and a couple of those note no improvement with glucosamine/chondroitin. If I find one that delineates the mechanism, I'll edit my answer. I suspect that it isn't quite known what causes it yet, or hasn't been confirmed.	2015-09-08 03:29:15Z	JohnP

3034	13655	@Sridhar-Sarnobat But then again, this answer does not give you anything but a personal opinion, additionally based on the assumption that there are no other factors. Basically you asked “Are people healthier when they move more?” and the reply was “Yes they are”.	2017-09-16 09:40:48Z	Philipp

Would you mind to adhere to this and provide sources for your claim? The question was Are big city residents healthier due to walking, too which you replied if they walk more, they are healthier. This is partly wrong (sola dosis facit venenum) and is not an answer to the question. Maybe big city residents do something else differently than those who live in rural areas, which you haven't covered in your answer.	2017-09-16 17:36:31Z	Narusan-in-coma

1968	5081	Understood. The "habitual" wake time is what matters -- when you usually wake up. Colloquially, "when your body tells you" it's time to get up. The fact that you set an alarm and made your body angry for a day doesn't change that. :-)	2016-03-10 04:19:58Z	Susan

1968	1970	I have to agree that this answer doesn't seem to address the OP's question. The question whether significant blood levels should be treated in the absence of symptoms is not addressed. For example, for TSH it is generally advised that people who have low levels and no symptoms actually do get treated.

1952	1974	So approximately how long can I take coffee after taking an antidepressant or vice versa? I mean thanks for the effort, but this is more information than I really need (well this may come in handy later on but for right now...). I get that I shouldn't take an antidepressant around the same time with coffee same as if I took a stimulant instead of an antidepressant, but how long do I have to wait approximately so as to avoid any synergy, palpitating or anything that causes negative side effects?	2015-09-13 07:19:47Z	
1952	1974	There is no way to predict exactly "how long" when it comes to symptoms. Look at the half life of your antidepressant, it can be considered eliminated after 5-6 half-lifes, but the symptoms of interaction probably stop earlier, you'll have to test that on yourself.	2015-09-13 09:49:15Z	rumtscho
1952	1974	@rumtscho What? Who said anything about symptoms? Okay, I shouldn't gulp down antidepressants with a cup of coffee, but assuming I plan to take both, at least how many minutes apart should I space them?	2015-09-14 13:55:47Z	
1952	1974	@JackBauer If "take it so you don't get symptoms" is not good enough for you, what are your criteria for not taking them? Do you want to ensure zero interaction? If yes, then you can't have coffee at all, because your dose is calculated such that the next dosage is taken before the last one has been eliminated. For example, amitriptyline has an average half-life of 15 hours so you need to wait 75 to 95 hours.	2015-09-14 14:25:55Z	rumtscho
1952	1974	@rumtscho Not zero interaction. Just not much interaction. As little interaction as possible. For coffee and Concerta it's at least an hour. What about coffee and antidepressants? At least an hour too?	2015-09-14 20:29:24Z	
1951	1958	Thanks Carey :) I see you're into stackover flow and health. Are you into medical technology or something?	2015-08-27 13:47:12Z	
1951	1958	@JackBauer I do work in that field and our products are used in healthcare arenas, but they're a few steps away from clinical practice. No doctor would have a mass spectrometer in his office. ;-) My medical knowledge comes more from an EMS background and general lifelong interest.	2015-08-27 21:03:50Z	Carey Gregory
1948	1949	Hmm. This occurs on any plane ride that reaches regular cruising altitude (30-33K feet). I thought the question was more complex than that. Maybe I over-read.	2015-08-25 05:26:58Z	anongoodnurse
1948	1949	@anongoodnurse It is most common for this to occur on plane rides. Other sources, such as Healthline, mention that both driving (which I would assume would include trains) and hiking (which is what the OP did) can also be a cause of ear barotrauma. Rapid altitude changes are the most likely causes, but almost any change in altitude can be a cause, most likely because the ear is usually not used to such pressures. Also, the person in the OP's family who got the ear infection was their young daughter, and children are more susceptible to this.	2015-08-25 20:58:51Z	michaelpri
1925	1926	To be honest, I was looking at both limiting hangovers and limiting intoxication as well (though of course the latter is significantly less useful). My assumption about Acetium is that preventing hangovers is a bit more complex than immediately apparent, but this seems like a great place to start. If you decide to go ahead with your dream, I expect an equity position :)	2015-08-21 10:38:53Z	
1925	1926	(Not @TheEnvironmentalist) A down vote.. Really? I guess a bit of humor is not quite tolerated here...	2015-08-21 18:19:47Z	arkiaamu
1925	4123	It looks like you left part of the word "intervention" hanging on there at the start of the chunk of text you quoted. Did you mean to include none of the word, all of the word, or earlier parts of the sentence, too?	2015-12-31 19:56:03Z	HDE 226868
1925	4123	@HDE226868 oh wow, I left out a big chunk. Which included the very important word "no". Ouups.	2016-01-02 09:49:11Z	YviDe
1925	1935	This isn't exactly what I was looking for, but is useful besides. Note I meant both hangover reduction and intoxication reduction, which both happen to be at least partially covered in this answer.	2015-08-22 08:59:52Z

1922	1927	I am male. Also, I read somewhere that growth in males stops around 20 years old. Is that true?	2015-08-24 21:43:07Z	
1921	4423	Hmm, I have removed lots of impacted wax from the ears of people, and the last thing in the world I would remove it with is a pointed metal object. (That would have some very serious repercussions, besides being totally ineffective at removing wax of any consistency from a narrow ear canal.) Impacted cerumen removal is carried out quite differently, at least in the US and Great Britain.	2016-01-16 20:26:54Z	anongoodnurse
1921	4423	Also, sorry to be picky, but you state, "external ear infections that might also affect the middle ear." How does that actually happen (there is a physical barrier between the two compartments), and how frequently does otitis externa leading to otitis media? (I assume that's what you mean?)	2016-01-16 20:34:45Z	anongoodnurse
1921	4423	Of course the first thing doctors use to remove earwax will be a water syringe that will push it outside, but when earwax is difficult to remove here in my hospital (Nort Italy) they use a 'L-shaped metal object (sorry, I don't know the English name) with a very thin point at the end to detach it from the external auditory canal, especially after applying some oxygenated water to soften earwax.	2016-01-17 15:36:13Z	Ozymandias
1921	4423	And of course, an otitis externa could spread to the midde ear if there is a perforation of the tympanic membrane.	2016-01-17 15:38:29Z	Ozymandias
1921	4423	Of course, to keep still enough to have a thin metal blade pushing between the hard cerumen and the sensitive ear canal, someone would practically have to be under general anesthesia so as not to move/flinch. Maybe there are more people with perforated eardrums in Italy. I don't know.	2016-01-17 19:39:15Z	anongoodnurse
1914	3863	so for this case, the first one, i.e., behavior threapy is applicable right?	2015-11-28 02:57:50Z	
1914	3863	@Rishika It's applicable indeed and in this specific case would probably be the best choice	2015-11-28 06:31:51Z	Denn
1914	3863	what is the maximum scope of improvement in this case?	2015-11-28 11:50:47Z	
1914	3863	@Rishika [This study on habit reversal](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26583455) finds there is "an improvement in terms of reduced tics and improved global functioning in both groups, without significant changes in terms of Quality of Life"	2015-11-29 13:36:26Z	Denn
1914	3863	This one is a detailed review on behaviour therapy and concludes "professional organizations recommend behavior therapy as a first-line intervention for individuals with mild-to-moderate tic severity", with significant results in terms of tic severity (percentage of reduction varying from 10-35%). Sorry for the double comment, was unaware of the 5-min rule.	2015-11-29 13:45:30Z	Denn
1897	1898	Good answer. Let´s not get into "chronic borreliosis" :). In the foreseealbe future, there will be tests to determine the presence of bacterial DNA in joint fluid In my workplace our lab can perform a PCR of a joint fluid sample. Last time we did this was a patient with atypical arthritis, it was suspected to be bacterial and thus PCR was done. Just to be sure, are you referring here for burgdorferi bacteria only or bacterial DNA in general?	2015-08-18 16:56:19Z	arkiaamu
1897	1898	@arkiaamu - B. burgdorferi; it wouldn't be much help if it were just  bacteria in general. ;-)	2015-08-18 18:24:07Z	anongoodnurse
1885	1941	Personal experience is helpful, but on this site (which may be different from many you're familiar with), sources are expected for all claims. If you could find a reliable source for a low serum ferritin being a cause of hair loss, it would be a great answer! Thanks.	2015-08-24 04:47:42Z	anongoodnurse
1881	1886	This answer is pretty comprehensive, so I will approve it. I probably will get it checked pretty soon, especially if the sweet smelling breath doesn't change or I start to get nauseous or unreasonably tired.	2015-08-15 12:30:44Z	
1881	1886	Nausea, vomiting, light-headed, feeling feint or passing out, and excessive sweating are all big no-no's. Go to the ER immediately (don't drive) or call 911.	2015-08-15 12:59:57Z	EMT_Jedi
1881	1886	"The reason for both of these symptoms can very well be due to your sugar levels becoming drastically high. In the medical field, we call this DKA. (Diabetic ketoacidosis)."  Extremely unlikely given that the OP managed to post here a few days later.	2015-08-15 15:15:36Z	Count Iblis
1881	1886	No doctor here. Also, you can be in mild DKA for awhile. Had a PT with a BGL of "high" (over 500 on our machines) for several days before he called us. Actually, he's a frequent flyer and does it about two times a month.	2015-08-15 15:32:03Z	EMT_Jedi
1881	1886	Everything is possible, including worrying too much. If you read the OP's account, focus more on the way of thinking in the question asked, it smells a lot more of the latter than of DKA.  Throwing up after coughing = nausea and nausea = sign of diabetes, that are two associations made and that after worrying about diabetes after the eating the gummy bear. With two associations the number of combinations are astronomically high, the hypochondriac's choice is guaranteed to be among the possibilities.	2015-08-15 15:49:00Z	Count Iblis
1865	1877	Exactly the kind of answer I was looking for, John.  But what about pathophysiology?	2015-08-17 17:29:57Z	
1865	1909	Great answer, arkiaamu :)	2015-08-21 03:47:53Z	
1865	1909	I'd say that pathogenesis it the object of study of pathophysiology, wouldn't call them synonyms, but they are closely related, so still a +1, nice example	2015-09-29 15:56:26Z	Lucky
1849	1850	Just curious, ointments are usually about 80% oil. I'm aware of lotions that have petrolatum in them (e.g.  Eucerin) but am unfamiliar with water-based ointments.  Can you please give me an example? (Not referring to a gel.)	2015-08-10 22:51:26Z	anongoodnurse
1849	1850	@anongoodnurse A single example is Bactroban. This table shows that water soluble ointment bases are sometimes used, but I agree that most ointments are oil-based.	2015-08-11 00:25:33Z	Carey Gregory
1849	1850	Thank you! That was very interesting. It's always a pleasure to learn new things. :-)	2015-08-11 02:45:26Z	anongoodnurse
1849	1850	In my case, the medicinal lotion/ointment is technically water based, but the active ingredient is cannabis oil.	2015-08-11 03:08:38Z	
1849	1850	Then I would think that using lotion first could reduce the effectiveness since it could either dilute the cannabis oil or interfere with its absorption. I'd go with a morning/night routine if that works for you.	2015-08-11 04:06:42Z	Carey Gregory
1837	1839	Here is another study where the inquiry is not limited to familial:  ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897003	2015-08-09 16:58:18Z	
1837	1839	Here it is identified for treating Huntington's Disease and to improve cognition:  ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841999   My OP relates to "why not give it a try"?	2015-08-09 17:05:09Z	
1837	1839	@WoundedEgo In your OP you talk about reversing alzheimer. Your first  study is about cognitive boost in healthy humans, second study is about whole another disease. They are out of context in this question.	2015-08-09 18:17:37Z	arkiaamu
1837	1839	"I'm still surprised that it isn't being broadly recommended for people to try, especially since it is so cheap". It has a good track record of helping with brain function and has reversed AD in mice (one type) so while there is no smoking gun here, I'm taking it!	2015-08-09 19:29:48Z	
1837	1839	I think there are some other things at play here. Where would one buy naturally AD mice? Transgenic mice would be easy to come by. Also, a full blown human trial that meets FDA approval apparently costs over a billion dollars. If they got fast track (and half of drugs do, bypassing trial stage IV) it would still cost almost half of that but there would not be the billions of profit because it is a cheap herb.	2015-08-10 18:42:48Z	
1819	1823	Care to explain why, downvoter?	2015-09-28 09:17:43Z	Ooker
1814	1815	The question is very relevant, but as in current form it is focusing only to one side of energy drinks in general. The answers should discuss energy drink as a whole, not only caffeine since energy drinks contains a lot of other, possibly, toxic substances. For example, this study published in a quality medical journal should be discussed: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3065144/pdf/zpe511.pdf	2015-08-07 09:48:36Z	arkiaamu
1814	1815	true that. Nevertheless the author did not ask about "energy drinks" in general which may contain thousands of different substances, but for a special product. None of the ingredients of this product is known to be seriosly dangerous in the given dosage.	2015-08-07 09:55:58Z	SalkinD
1810	1811	Re: Your last sentence. Fat loss in the body works on the LIFO (Last In, First Out) order, so if the region in question was the first accumulation point, it will be the last to come off. I will work on finding references, this is from classes for my kinesiology degree.	2015-08-11 22:20:49Z	JohnP
1794	1796	I see, I thought it somehow had to do with mucus, but I wasn't sure. Does this also explain why these mucous membranes start secreting more mucus as the day goes by? Or is that then caused by the possible pathogens inhaled, causing the immune system to kick in?	2015-08-05 21:21:01Z	
1794	1796	@Yorrick If you mean the increased mucus that happens when you're coming down with a cold or similar infection, it's the immune system kicking in.	2015-08-05 21:29:27Z	Carey Gregory
1794	1796	Yeah that's what I meant, I assumed that's what it is, however I prefer asking & being sure over assuming. Thanks for the informative (and very well-worded) answer, I'm smarter than I was before! :'D	2015-08-05 21:33:41Z	
1790	1791	Although a salt water rinse will kill some bacteria, it can only reach bacteria at or very near the surface. Deeper bacteria, where most of the underlying infection actually resides, will be unaffected. This is why his periodontist said the treatment needs to continue. Salt also draws fluid out of tissue it comes into contact with through osmosis. This has the temporary effect of reducing swelling, which in turn has the effect of reducing pain. Although it is an effective relief from pain, it does not and cannot cure the infection.	2015-08-05 15:23:34Z	Carey Gregory
1790	1791	Personally, If I have toothache or gum pain, I don't take any painkiller drugs, I just put directly a pinch of non-dissolved salt on the surface of the inflammation 3 times a day, and let it do its action. The infection and the pain it comes with disappear totally! And I don't know if this works for other people. :)	2015-08-05 16:49:01Z	HealthLove
1790	1791	It might help speed the healing of some infections, and it can definitely relieve pain caused by swelling, but in all likelihood the healing would have happened just as fast without it. The real question is why you're experiencing toothaches and gum pain in the first place. Those aren't common maladies for people who maintain proper dental hygiene and dental care.	2015-08-05 19:19:09Z	Carey Gregory
1789	1797	No, there is no cure for tinnitus: such a hard statement should be backed up by solid references. Moreover, it is plain untrue with regard to pulsatile tinnitus, which can be cured. Tinnitus is a symptom that can have a host of etiologies. Be careful with this kind of black-and-white answers. I would have downvoted if I could :)	2015-08-07 10:32:01Z	AliceD
1789	1797	@AliceD I wasn't thinking of pulsate tinnitus, which is a very different beast despite the name it has in common with "standard" tinnitus. The book I mention does not give any cure for tinnitus, and I have never seen another credible source to disagree with it, nor have I met a patient who really got a (non pulsatile) tinnitus cured, all the ones I know still have it. If you know a cure though, I'd be very happy to learn about it!	2015-08-16 11:27:24Z	rumtscho
1789	1797	+1, it's probably worth editing to mention Pulsatile Tinnitus in the answer however, because without skilled diagnostics/exam, I don't expect a pt to be able discern anything beyond "my ear is ringing." Further, I would give the term tinnitus retraining therapy as a good search term and starting point.  The Textbook of Tinnitus is the standard in the US (Google Book Link)	2016-12-07 16:48:05Z	Atl LED

1785	1786	"because the drug intake/hour should be more or less constant." maybe it should be, but it isn't ;-), at least according to the study I found (see my answer) The drug intake is lower the first three hours or so	2016-03-02 13:27:35Z	YviDe
1784	1787	I have major concerns regarding this answer (as I had with the question). References are definitely needed. For example, this is very strong simplification: "your immune system works better with proper lymph drainage". "will improve your health" Do you mean that the improvement in health is due to better movement of the lymphatic fluid, if so, references definitely warranted.	2015-08-05 15:50:12Z	arkiaamu
1784	1787	I assumed the author may not look for a too intricate answer. Thats why I added a "simplified". The correct answer to this would be too complex. To give you some references on the importance of lymphatic system see this review ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3780287, search for comlications of lymphedema to find articles like that ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162204.	2015-08-06 18:13:58Z	SalkinD
1784	1787	I'm sorry that I didn't receive the notifications. I'm still not sure if your answer is against or agree with the "inactive exercise".	2015-08-20 18:18:32Z	
1783	1788	I am very familiar with particulate matter pollution and I just finished a paper for my class on it. Including references, the title, etc, it is 21 pages. I didn't find a lot on HEPA air filters. I found one academic paper that state that a HEPA air filter can decrease concentrations by up to 80%, if used at least 75% of the time. But another states that it doesn't seem to help with allergies.	2015-08-05 09:25:28Z	
1783	1788	If it is used frequently and it can really reduce particulate matter that much, I would really think it should help protect health	2015-08-05 09:26:08Z	
1783	1788	If I look through my university's library, I bet I can find more on this topic. My first couple searches didn't help much, but usually trying a few different searches eventually finds some good materials.	2015-08-05 09:28:25Z	
1762	1763	Thank you for your answer, it made me think more about a lot of things I never considered before. Now I need to figure out how to determine if it is allergy or irritants. I'll start noting these things down. I already noticed some things. When people spray nearly anything (I HATE Axe) it really bothers me. A hot, steamy room (basically, the bathroom when someone just took a hot shower) can trigger a reaction with the first breathe. But if I avoid that air, it doesn't bother me as soon as I'm away from it.	2015-08-02 19:10:54Z

1749	1834	Apologies. I have updated the heading as well as the body of the question. I am unsure as to why the provider has given a comparison of IgG and IgE. Is the higher IgG an indication of something? For example, if one looks at sweet potato, it has a reasonably high IgG reaction however a slightly lower IgG result. Does the correlation mean something?	2015-08-12 07:08:38Z

1745	1753	This was originally on the fitness site, and was asked in the context of the hard workouts required to achieve hypertrophy. After these workouts the immune system is not able to function as effectively, because the body has worked so incredibly hard. Here is a link livestrong.com/article/…	2015-08-03 08:52:34Z	
1745	1753	@VictorySaber You're talking about overtraining syndrome (OTS). I wish you had made that clear in your question because it makes it a completely different question. However, the gist of my answer still applies. I will edit to reflect your clarification.	2015-08-03 13:39:15Z	Carey Gregory

1745	1747	There are many different branches of the immune system. Why do you think  that the boost from Vit. D helps "prevent" colds? Can anything but isolation, meticulous hand washing, and never touching your face prevent colds? (There is an answer to this; just not yours.) Second paragraph needs references. "Chances are" is only an opinion.	2015-07-31 15:38:05Z	anongoodnurse
1745	1747	Isolation, meticulous hand washing, and never touching your face will indeed prevent colds, but that's due to avoiding facing the real problem. It's like the well known method to never fail an exam at university by not going to study at university in the first place.	2015-08-01 19:33:39Z	Count Iblis
1745	1747	if you can prove there are ways to boost immunity against the common cold, please feel free to do so! But there is no correlation between the evidence you cited and increased resistance to colds.	2015-08-01 22:31:18Z	anongoodnurse
1745	1747	+1 - Vitamin D will boost your health in general. If you have a shortage, you will feel better when taking 2000 IU daily. You should let your physician measure your blood for 25-(OH)D and make sure it's above 30 ng. Although it might not act on a cold, it will act on how you feel, and that makes that you get sick less. It might not explain this problem, but it's worth to test this out. In general we don't have enough, because we keep out of the sun too much or use sunscreen too much, even if you're living in Florida or Australia. In the mean time, take enough calcium as well!	2015-08-03 15:15:48Z	SPRBRN

1706	1711	+0. The questioner asked a question in lay terms, but you gave an answer full of medical jargon. Your answer is useful to medical experts, but may not be as useful to the asker. In the future, it would be best if you could please try to avoid jargon as much as possible, especially when the asker is a layperson.	2017-04-24 19:10:07Z	tealhill
1706	1711	Thanks @tealhill, I'd be happy to try to improve it. I attempted to define my terms in ways that would be comprehensible to OP and others. What jargon is used here that isn't defined?	2017-04-24 19:23:18Z	Susan
1706	1711	+1  Respectfully, I disagree with the previous commenter.  Your terms are well defined, and anyone who is actually embarking on IVF really needs to be able to understand this level of technical terminology.  I am not in the medical profession, and I found it all very helpful.  The only change that I might recommend would be to repeat the common names ("identical" and "fraternal")  in parentheses after the formal names in the paragraphs where you define them.  (e.g. **Dizygotic (fraternal) twins and higher multiples occur because more than one egg.....") As you did in paragraph 1.	2017-08-15 20:06:43Z	Adam

1704	1719	"Many non-addictive sleeping pills can be mentally addictive. If you do not mind using sleeping pills for the rest of your life, then that is a perfectly fine choice." You really need to back up such statements. It may be "common knowledge", but a lot of "common knowledge" (like drinking 8 glasses of water per day) is not true at all. Look up melatonin and suvorexant, for example.	2015-07-27 22:31:36Z	anongoodnurse
1704	1719	What about 8 glasses of water is common knowledge? Just unsure what you mean.  What is your take, pertaining to melatonin and suvorexant? Do you deem it as non-addictive, both physically and mentally?	2015-07-28 00:01:02Z	agent provocateur

1697	1698	@MerlotLatterian you're most welcome! For future though: it is not recommended to accept an answer right away (not that I'm complaining :-)), because another answer that suits your needs better might come in a few days. This doesn't happen often at health SE, because the website is relatively new, so many questions (though not all) get only one answer for now (we have an answer ration of 1.4 answer per question at the moment, I think).	2015-07-25 13:15:56Z	Lucky
1697	1698	I know! I'm familiar to StackExchange's methods. Yes you're right. Maybe I should've wauted more but your answer gave me whatever I need so ... why waiting?! By the way, I took control over myself. Now I hardly ever drink more than 3 cups daily.	2015-11-04 04:55:29Z

1678	1679	Yeah she pretty much does what you have mentioned, a few small means and ginger (tea, ale, candy, actual ginger root), also milk makes it worse I believe.  She does have toast at night and crackers every now and again.  It doesn't have to do with a relapse at this point, I believe that has been ruled out.   These things help it go away most of the time (though they can take a while) after the nausea occurs but I was sort of looking for a way to get at completely preventing the morning nausea?  I just thought there was some medication or remedy I haven't hear of in this modern day.	2015-07-24 05:08:32Z	
1678	1679	At least in America, many ginger ales don't contain real ginger, at least in any listed amount. I've found those less effective. I use a product that is only ginger juice with a bit of honey and lemon to make it taste better, I find it works as well as ginger tea. Drinking it regularly can be preventative, and, since it's in the fridge, it's easily accessible, especially if I'm not up to making tea. This is an anecdote, not a study, so I hope you don't mind me mentioning it.	2016-08-20 20:53:27Z	Sue
1678	1679	Not at all. Any suggestions for which product you use?	2017-10-31 21:05:13Z

1646	1654	There are many, many sources that propose 8x8 based on nothing at all. I would be very interested in good references for why drinking excess water is better for healthy people than letting thirst be your guide. Clearly in some cases, more water is needed; but I think the 8x8 recommendation is a myth. Unfortunately one that Mayo's website might be propagating?	2015-07-23 01:33:22Z	anongoodnurse

1640	3756	But isn't this then a sign of hardened arteries? If you are not very relaxed, the heart will work a bit harder, but the blood vessels should expand so that the pressure doesn't rise all that much. Only if you exercise very hard and your heart is pumping blood very fast should the blood pressure rise significantly.	2015-11-17 05:15:49Z	Count Iblis
1640	3756	Interesting comment.  The answer is I don't know.  My take is that almost any measurement is not what people think they are.  They get just one take of their blood pressure, cholesterol level, and many other blood health metrics just once.  And, we take it as a very precise and representative state of our health at anyone time.  Yet, both measurements and physiological volatilities from one minute to the next can play a substantial role in moving the needle materially on the measurement outcome.	2015-11-17 17:04:02Z	Sympa
1640	3756	This is why the ambulatory blood pressure monitor was invented. A 24-hour sample should be sufficient for most people to get a pretty good idea what their BP is really like over the course of a day.	2015-11-18 06:07:41Z	Carey Gregory
1640	3756	Although I think you make a valid point about one-time spot measurements of things like BP that can change rapidly, I don't think this is an answer. It's a comment. The OP wants to know if his BP rising during the day is normal and I don't see anything in your post that addresses that.	2015-11-18 06:14:02Z	Carey Gregory

1638	1712	Thanks for this Anna! If I get it right, the mean calcium absorption is 25%, so if the recommendation is to "eat" 1000mg/day then the recommendation for actual calcium absoption should be 250mg/day. Is that right?	2015-07-28 12:50:33Z	
1636	3230	First, welcome and you are correct.  Will you make DOI links preferably, or at least public links, and also include a reference for your two bullet points?  For our site it's particularly important to be well referenced.	2015-09-25 18:36:46Z	Atl LED
1636	3230	I'm not sure if I can make a DOI link for that source. It appears that if I access the link from Google first, I can access it later. After some time, however, clicking on the link just brings me to Medscape's login page. I've downloaded a PDF of the article from another source (Wiley Periodicals), but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to distribute it. The title of the article is Evaluating MRI-Compatible Pacemakers: Patient Data Now Paves the Way to Widespread Clinical Application?. I'm going to look around for other papers I can link to.	2015-09-28 15:45:01Z	watkipet
1636	3230	Check the pubmed and do you notice the doi part of your edit (doi: 10.1111/pace.12061) you can in fact make a DOI link out of that.  The change in access may have something to do with what ISP you're using, are you perhaps sometimes looking at the link from an institution or university?	2015-09-28 17:17:37Z	Atl LED
1636	3230	@Atl LED, Thanks! I think I finally understand how to make the DOI link.	2015-09-28 17:30:33Z	watkipet

1635	5560	Thanks @Praxiteles. A clarification: "...cool drinks actually make it metabolically easier for the body to digest food because it doesn't have to work as hard to cool down after eating." Are you referring to taking cold drink after eating (that's what your point suggests)?	2016-04-22 02:11:07Z	
1635	5560	@Ruchir Yes, a cold drink after when the the body is heating up as it digests the food.	2016-04-22 07:24:52Z	Praxiteles
1632	3458	If needed, I can add more details and sources on most of these things, but the app is already getting pretty confused by the number of links.. And I didn't want to post a 3000 word essay unless needed ;-)	2015-10-18 13:25:59Z	YviDe
1632	3458	I think antibody is probably referring to irregular agglutinin test, which indicates incompatibility between mother and fetus. On another note, Toxoplasmosis test is missing. Also there is no screening for Down's syndrome (this is standard where I live, but would of course be only interesting if you and your spouse would like to know if there's a risk or not and if it's available in Dubai).	2015-12-02 20:32:56Z	Denn
1632	3458	@Denn "antibodies" could be the toxoplasmosis antibody test, actually.  At least the NT ultrasound part of Down screening could be covered under "ultrasound". Hard to know without more information.	2015-12-02 20:59:09Z	YviDe
1632	3458	Good point, I was thinking it had to be something linked to blood type because it was on the same line but it could be toxo as well.	2015-12-02 21:04:07Z	Denn
1627	1479	That PNAS study isn't saying what you think it is saying. First of all, these subjects did not usually have that sleep rhythm, like the OP does. The researchers deliberately interrupted their sleep to get them to sleep from noon to evening. Second, the effect they saw was that genes were activated differently than with the subject's usual rhythm. While that's interesting, it is not in itself either a positive or negative effect. That's discussed in the WebMD article as well, but there's a lot of handwaving with "we don't know what this means, but it probably isn't good"	2016-03-04 21:15:05Z	YviDe
1627	1479	At least from your sources, I don't think "lack of sleep won't do you as much damage as irregular or day sleep" is justified.	2016-03-04 21:18:22Z	YviDe
1617	1622	Thanks a lot! I think I'm starting to get used to the new schedule. As of eating, I eat just enough to continue breathing. No, really, I don't much enjoy food. For exercise, I do sports about 7~8 hours a week. But most of my days are just behind a computer screen, which I think is the root of my sleeping habits. Anyway, thanks for the advice.	2015-07-21 08:06:48Z

1609	3371	from the source cited in your  source  "whereas the risks of breast, cervical, and liver cancer appear to be increased". This is sloppy science! Addendum: Almost the important part is the absolute increase in risk, as illustrated in the example I gave above.	2015-10-09 15:15:02Z	
1609	3371	@pindakaas - If you follow the link to the actual study from that sentence, you find this in the abstract:  "...indicate that there is a reduction in the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer, a possible small increase in the risk for breast and cervical cancer,..." - i.e. a possible, not proven yet, small increase in the risk. And most of these risks disappear over time after stopping use.	2015-10-09 15:45:25Z	JohnP
1609	3371	@Sean - Your source states, "The risk of breast cancer may or may not be slightly increased: studies do not agree." This does not support your answer.

1607	1628	thanks lucky, for the detailed explanation. you're assuming the nos. 90,99 etc refer to confidence levels and not clinical trial results because for a medicine to cure 99% of the participants would be too impractical. right?	2015-07-21 06:01:19Z	
1607	1628	@user221238 yes, but I can only assume. There's no way to be sure with those two sentences, they sound incomplete. The thing that nudged me towards this is the fact that the number is in front of the word trial (it serves like an adjective, sort of describes it) - and one of the major things in interpreting the results of clinical trials is to decide the confidence level, it partly describes the chance for your conclusion to be accurate. But, to be honest, scientific statements shouldn't leave room for guessing - they should be clear and precise. (And you're welcome :-))	2015-07-21 09:53:51Z	Lucky
1595	10959	Welcome to health SE :-).

1572	1573	I am curious how this relates to heart failure. I understand that grapefruit interferes with the metabolism of medications, but why heart failure?	2015-07-15 18:52:33Z	anongoodnurse
1572	1573	Thank you for the excellent answer, and a good point from @anongoodnurse, it's because I have been diagnosed and am being treated for heart failure, and it is in that context that I am interested.	2015-07-15 18:58:06Z	
1572	1573	@anongoodnurse - I amended my answer to point out that the original source simply mentioned some cholesterol-lowering medications (statins) affected by grapefruit consumption. And another link to a study recommending grapefruit to lower cholesterol to reduce the risk of coronary disease. So I don't think it is heart failure in particular for which eating grapefruit is contraindicated - at least no evidence of this has been offered.	2015-07-15 19:13:59Z	Chris Jenks
1572	1573	I am aware of the relationship between grapefruit juice and decreased efficacy of statins. This still does not answer the OP's question: "Drinking a lot of grapefruit juice is not recommended for patients with heart failure. Does the same apply to lemon juice? [A]nd whatever the answer, why?"	2015-07-15 23:00:34Z	anongoodnurse
1572	1573	But the study the OP gave as the source for the question is titled "Does grapefruit affect my medicine?" Why would lemons have the same affect on medication metabolism described in that study?	2015-07-15 23:25:51Z	Chris Jenks

1544	1586	"winter-time depression is among the lowest rates of any population in the entire world" can you add a citation for that? The research linked in the Atlantic article doesn't mention it and the Atlantic article only says "lower rates of wintertime depression than would be expected given the long winters and high latitude"	2015-11-01 13:51:41Z	YviDe
1544	1586	@YviDe The "lower rates of wintertime depression than would be expected given the long winters and high latitude" is what is needed, because you need to keep the exposure to dark winter conditions equal when making comparisons.	2015-11-02 16:24:36Z	Count Iblis
1544	1586	The research still found sleeping problems in over 10 percent and depression (self-reported, which is notorious for being lower than the real number) in about 8 percent of the population. A far cry from the "they don't experience depression" in this answer.	2015-11-02 16:29:50Z	YviDe

1536	1538	That increase in fracture risk in the first study you cite was not significant, though, the 95 percent confidence interval includes 1, so you really can't say it was increased.	2016-01-19 19:04:39Z	YviDe
1530	1531	Disagree.  The questioner is talking about the depression in the skin that results from the pressure of the frame. This is commonly observed,  in wearers of eyeglasses, even those who do not complain of headaches and indeed, the questioner reports being able to SEE the depressions.  Where is your reference that sutures are palpable in adults having a normal cranium?  I do not think it would be an easy thing, if it is possible at all.  All sutures will be covered by skin, and some by muscle as well.  They would have to be pathologically fused to be palpable -- markedly pathological to be seen!	2015-07-12 06:31:09Z	Iron Pillow
1530	1531	Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not abnormal, yet I can feel all of the major ones and even where they meet. I guarantee I could feel them on most anyone whose hair isn't too thick. Come up with a better answer and post it. As I further stated: "note, I'm not saying a lifetime of tight glasses don't make their mark. I just don't think that dent is unique to people who wear glasses."	2015-07-12 09:59:44Z	anongoodnurse
1530	1531	I do feel the dent when I haven't worn glasses in a while (after sleep), but much more lightly. The thing is that after intense workout I often get a headache, but when I take off my glasses, I start to feel better.  I was just using my uneducated guess that the frame of my glasses was interfering with the blood flow along the sides of my head.	2015-07-14 07:32:47Z	
1530	1531	I'm not surprised you feel better after the glasses come off. With a headache, it's unpleasant to have something putting pressure on your head. But the cause and effect is hard to tease out. It sounds like the glasses are tight enough to cause fluid shifting in your soft tissues, but that doesn't mean they restrict blood flow. As I said, the test is doing all your exertion either with contacts, without your glasses, or (as said by someone else) get a different pair for exercise that attach to the head differently. But it's going to cause friction somewhere. They must stay on somehow.	2015-07-14 07:41:24Z	anongoodnurse

1490	1491	Primary polydipsia is not caused by excess water consumption; it's defined as inappropriate thirst causing excess water consumption. Misquoting the article is a no-no. Please correct.	2015-07-09 01:59:31Z	anongoodnurse
1490	1491	@anongoodnurse ,  It says that: " Rather than a problem with ADH production or damage, the underlying cause is intake of excessive fluids."   Then this excessive intake can in turn be caused by a disorder causing inappropriate thirst, but it remains a fact that it is the excessive drinking of water that is then doing the damage.	2015-07-09 02:17:00Z	Count Iblis
1490	1491	You are misinterpreting what you are reading. The top of the section lists Causes [of excess water consumption]. Primary polydipsia is one of the causes. Please reread and correct. You write "...you may get other problems, like primary polydipsia." It is critical on a site such as this that you interpret articles correctly.	2015-07-09 02:23:16Z	anongoodnurse
1490	1491	But clearly primary polydipsia can itself be caused by drinking too much water.	2015-07-09 19:10:47Z	Count Iblis

1488	1500	This answer assumes that exposure to the cold virus is bound to cause the cold and must therefore be avoided. The real problem is that given some frequency at which people do get exposed to the cold virus, some people get ill far more frequently than others (OP gets 6 colds per year, I only got 3 colds in the last ten years). These huge differences are not due to more frequent hand washing, the research shows that you only get a modest reduction by taking such measures to avoid exposure to the cold virus.	2015-09-18 17:04:17Z	Count Iblis

1487	1489	That's very interesting, thanks for the reply :) So both indexes are important, but commonly the tests are to find out the equilibrium glucose levels, to which the body is exposed most of the time. If I understood correctly then, I should just need to fast for about 2 hours before the test, because that's how long the peaks take to normalize. Correct?	2015-07-08 19:14:49Z	
1487	1489	@LuanNico the tests have been calibrated with a full night of fasting, this is why you can only rely on the result after this long fasting. First, the peak should take 2 hours to subside in healthy subjects, it may have a different speed if you have some condition. Second, this is only about first order effects, biology is usually more complicated than that. Third, these tests are measuring more than just blood sugar. I don't know how food affects each of the markers measured in a blood test, but if you are told to fast overnight, there is a reason for it, secondguessing can throw off results.	2015-07-08 20:38:40Z	rumtscho

1481	1518	" Low blood concentrations of alcohol are efficiently converted into acetate and excreted" ... this is incorrect.  Acetate is never excreted.  It enters the TCA cycle and is metabolized into CO2, water, and reduced nucleotides.  It may also participate in de novo fatty acid synthesis.	2015-07-10 21:29:40Z	scottb
1481	1518	"but at high concentrations some of the alcohol is converted into acetaldehyde which is toxic and may lead to liver cell death and replacement, " ... this is misleading.  The mechanisms of hepatic toxicity from alcohol are complex.  There is an important role of redox state change and gluathione depletion and a consequent inability to protect against oxidative stress.	2015-07-10 21:40:55Z	scottb
1481	1518	"This "cell death" leads to the release of toxins from the cells which may contribute to the experience of hangover. " ... you'll need to provide a reference for this.

1481	1518	I'm surprised that the methanol content is that high. I imagine the methanol content of scotch is higher than for wine because scotch is distilled, concentrating both the ethanol and the methanol. But I would still argue that this methanol is not toxicologically significant for a few reasons: At 0.1%, a liter of wine contains only 1 mL of methanol - less than the amount produced from metabolism of a kilo of apples (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol). Second, ethanol metabolism inhibits methanol metabolism (and is used as an antidote), making the methanol in these beverages less toxic.	2015-07-14 17:55:00Z	Chris Jenks

1474	1545	@fatherazrael - Do you have time that you could consider volunteering to do something? I find it makes a profound difference to how I feel if I am focused on assisting others than if I am left to contemplate my life, even if my circumstances are otherwise the same. You like to be outdoors - this would be a good time to go camping. It sounds like you are ready for a career change too, but you will need peace of mind and vision to lead you to the next one. That's my main advice - do what it takes to relax so you can reflect and know what to do. Let me add that to my Answer.	2015-07-14 18:11:30Z	Chris Jenks
1474	1545	Thanks looking for right time where hit upon an idea comes into mind. Regarding volunteering Before message, yes.

1471	1779	Downvotes can mean anything. In this case, I can answer, since it was my downvote. I think you're missing the main effect(s) that exercise has on the heart.	2015-08-04 17:59:51Z	anongoodnurse
1471	1779	Still puzzled here. While doing pushups you work with your upper trunk. This results to increased blood flow in the upper body muscles. This increases the demand for oxygen. As a result heart starts to pump more intensively. This means that heart must work = contract more forcefully. This may result to heart muscle growth. I assume here that the OP have no basic idea of cardiovascular physiology.	2015-08-04 18:33:14Z	arkiaamu
1471	1779	You're saying that when the heart works harder but afterload is normal, beneficial hypertrophy happens. So what about patients with atrial flutter, SVT and other supraventricular arrhythmias? They can sustain very high heart rates for hours, days, or even weeks at a time with normal afterload and yet never derive any benefit at all. In fact, they will likely experience pathological hypertrophy if their abnormal rhythm is allowed to continue for weeks or months. Therefore, there has to be more to it than afterload.	2015-11-15 17:01:25Z	Carey Gregory
1469	1472	Thanks for your response.  The above things are not eaten the other day but like once or twice a week.

1415	1479	That PNAS study isn't saying what you think it is saying. First of all, these subjects did not usually have that sleep rhythm, like the OP does. The researchers deliberately interrupted their sleep to get them to sleep from noon to evening. Second, the effect they saw was that genes were activated differently than with the subject's usual rhythm. While that's interesting, it is not in itself either a positive or negative effect. That's discussed in the WebMD article as well, but there's a lot of handwaving with "we don't know what this means, but it probably isn't good"	2016-03-04 21:15:05Z	YviDe
1415	1479	At least from your sources, I don't think "lack of sleep won't do you as much damage as irregular or day sleep" is justified.	2016-03-04 21:18:22Z	YviDe

1413	12864	The relationship between NRR and attenuation is very complicated. Further, even at 100 dB and 9 dB attenuation (which is the worse case by your numbers), you could still mow the lawn for nearly 8 hours. Finally, you should provide a reference about the noise required for the sensation of pain since it is often quoted at 120 dB.	2017-09-05 15:15:29Z	StrongBad

1393	1424	Sure, it is answerable if you want to be irresponsible.  A responsible answer, however, requires too many caveats, or, without them, too many assumptions.  OP has signs of being desperate to lose weight (i.e. combining fasting plus exercise).  This suggests s/he is overweight and probably sedentary, which raises the probability of complications, no matter what answer is given.  What else hasn't OP told us?  There is no hint as to age, nor prior medical history -- certain medications could make this dangerous indeed.  OP's question has many moving parts, any of which could lead to harm.	2015-06-30 05:35:36Z	Iron Pillow

1313	10548	That's what I am missing in this whole discussion (not only in this question, but the same topic found anywhere on the Internet): an authoritative source that confirms that the calories listed for alcohol are metabolic energy and not simply combustible energy.	2016-12-20 11:09:12Z	
1313	10548	@rumtscho, I added one source above. Also, I know for a fact that the USDA.gov uses "metabolic energy" for their calorie values - this claim is somewhere on USDA.gov, but I just can't find the link now.	2016-12-20 11:48:07Z	Jan

1309	1311	The quote you have there is for nonprescription drugs, though. For prescription drugs, it reads like you have to travel with them ("The drug must be for your use or for the use of a person who is travelling with you") and can't have them shipped to you.	2016-03-02 13:32:03Z	YviDe
1308	1310	Welcome to Health! Please try to avoid answering with only quotes. Referencing to a reliable source is a great way to add to the credibility of an answer, but you must also explain how that citation answers the question. Quote-only answers don't add any value to the internet and are a bad practice, especially during a site's beta period. Instead, try to use your own words and experience and relate those to the source.	2015-06-20 13:45:57Z	michaelpri
1307	1327	Nice answer. Probably the best recommendation from your reference and the least often done is: "Ask your pharmacist for the package insert for each prescription drug you take."	2015-06-21 22:02:41Z	anongoodnurse
1307	1333	Warfarin is a bad example because EVERYTHING interacts with it.  A hematology professor I knew, who specialized in coagulation disorders, would pass out a list of substances that did NOT interact with warfarin.  The list was exactly 5 items long.  The only item I can remember from it is tetanus toxoid.	2015-06-21 22:17:23Z	Iron Pillow
1307	1333	@IronPillow - Warfarin is a good example, because many things interact with it (due to the commonly used metabolic pathway.) The problem is finding out what is clinically significant and what isn't. That is my entire point. (um, was that really unclear? "These programs tend to flag all interactions, making it difficult for the patient to interpret the reaction's significance.") Also, there are a lot of drugs that don't interfere with warfarin.	2015-06-21 23:10:48Z	anongoodnurse
1300	1301	I agree with you on some of your points and I want to disagree on some of them. First of all wikipedia is not the ultimate reference for anything and it is just a basic info which may not have correct details. Here in this particular case, it is about a treatment and only experienced people, researchers or journals can give us correct info about it. You agree that it contains the minerals and other things, and both of us don't know how effective it could be and let's for someone for a few more days.	2015-06-19 20:07:11Z	
1300	1301	To be clear : There is zero , none , inexistent, scientific recommendations to drink your own pee for ANY reason , and drink to get minerals and hormones is completely non-sense . Your body have millions off years of evolution to no discard things it needs. You want to get minerals?? Eat food , not drink your urine	2015-06-19 20:19:24Z	Freedo
1300	1301	I was checking the links for the medicines you provided. See this link for the first two ones and about Panafil- Ointment is an enzymatic healing-debriding ointment which contains papain, USP,  urea, and chlorophyllin copper complex sodium, etc. So that means it contains urea and it is in human urine. Companies won't told you from where they are extracting it. For the last two ones, you agreed that they are half true.	2015-06-19 20:20:50Z	
1300	1301	There are a number of medicines listed in it but I am not going to list all of them here. Also there is detailed info about each contents of urine. If it is a waste, I don't think amazon sell it here even now. Remember the original book was written in 1940s. It is not emphasizing on drinking urine, but trying to prove the medicinal properties of urine. It also mention about treatment for physical wounds too. So I am not gonna trash it soon, just waiting for now.	2015-06-19 20:26:59Z	
1300	1301	@MoonMind After the evidence Freedom provided you're still giving credence to a book written 75 years ago which has achieved no acceptance among scientists or doctors anywhere?	2015-06-19 21:56:38Z	Carey Gregory
1300	1373	I think people are down voting this because you don't provide any links to this studies. The mere fact they appear in a written book proof nothing if you can't look in this studies. I couldn't find any of this studies on google.com and scholar.google.com. Could you add links to this studies?	2015-06-25 17:34:59Z	Freedo

1289	1329	I understand all of the information you provided, and appreciate the effort, but I'm not sure this addresses my actual concern.  I would like to get a statistical lives saved per pint of blood average, factoring in all the ways the blood product is used, the odds of a treatment not occurring due to lack of a product, odds of a treatment successfully saving a  life that would have otherwise died within the next few weeks due to lack of treatment etc.  I know that a doctor will never say "this treatment saved this life", but a general statistical number can be produced without doing so.	2015-06-22 19:19:08Z	
1289	1329	I do realize I'm asking allot in the question, but if I can get information on where to find statistics, such as what the most common treatments are, what there NNT is, and statistical odds of a treatment not being performed due to lack of product I could do the math.  Even if you could point me to a lower bound by suggesting the few most important treatments (ones more likely to save lives) that would help.  By defining a number I'm better able to make further calculations on viability of blood collection options I'm interested in.	2015-06-22 19:22:37Z

1284	1303	I completely disagree with your assertion that genetics play only an insignificant role in weight gain and therefore obesity. Although environmental factors are important, there is considerable evidence that genes also have a significant role in its pathogenesis.	2015-06-19 19:12:02Z	Carey Gregory
1284	1303	Agree with calorie dense issue at most fast food places. McDonalds (and many other fast food places) serve regular food, just in a limited balance. Their burger meat is plain ground beef, there is bread, a little vege matter, and a little sugary sauce. Many people make worse meals at home!	2015-06-20 23:43:43Z	TFD
1284	1306	This is more of an opinion than an answer that meets health SE standards and requirements for references.

1284	1323	There's nothing wrong with the logic of this answer, but it is rather imprecise. " [...] if you eat fast food everyday say at lunch time" was a part of the question - so this answer doesn't really address the main concern here and it basically says the same thing as JohnP's answer in a different way...  This answer would be great for a different stackexchange site (IMO) but health SE does have strict policies on corroborating your answer with proven facts.	2015-10-02 05:54:09Z	Lucky
1279	3908	I feel like you may be missing an important part to address.  You address the need for plattelets, but your #1 point ignores the other benefits of whole blood.  While it provides a fraction of the platelets it provides red blood cells and plasma as well, and can be transfused as whole blood without being broken into sub-components if needed.  I'm sure platelet donations provides more platelets, but what I don't know is how does the good of the other components compare to platelets, can more plasma and red blood cells make up for less platelets?	2015-12-01 16:58:23Z	
1279	3908	I promise few like donating platelets more then whole blood.  Having to sit still for 1.5 hours is surprisingly horrible, not able to itch your own nose or turn a page in a book etc.  It's worse for me because I'm not a movie person; the one entertainment activity available to me, and generally lack patients for inactivity.  However, I can donate 4 times as much with platelets as whole blood, so one person willing to do it can make up for a few who won't.  I'm sure there are still fewer platelet donations then whole blood even with that though.	2015-12-01 17:00:30Z	
1279	3908	I added a link in my question, it may help with the comparison between the options; just if you were interested.	2015-12-01 19:15:52Z	
1279	3908	@dsollen Okay, I'll think this all over.	2015-12-01 21:42:44Z	HDE 226868
1276	1278	first, this is a really great answer, far more detail then I anticipated, and referenced!  However, since you seem like a good information source now I want to see if I can get even more great data out of you.  Could you give any idea of the current cost of blood deficits?  as in how many lives are (presumed) lost a year due to lack of supplies or using suboptimal products/amounts?  I know that's a very hard number to estimate, but I would be quite interested in any data you may have.	2015-06-17 19:30:46Z	
1276	1278	The red cross always says that one donation can save 'up to' three lives.  I figure that's a best case scenario, I'm not really saving 3 lives every time I donate blood, sometimes during a surplus I may save no lives.  However, I'm curious on average how many lives are 'probably' saved with one donation of whole blood from a random (not O-) donor?   Probably worthy of it's own question really; but it would be cool to be able to say exactly how many lives I have saved 'on average' from all my donations of B+ blood :)	2015-06-17 19:34:26Z	
1276	1278	@dsollen I agree that probably that should be its own question. The '3 lives' is presumably referring to the 3 usable components (although 1 whole blood donor => ~0.25 platelet xfusions, so really 2.25). In order to compute any sort of a reasonable estimate, though, you'd need to know  a NNT (number needed to treat) to prevent 1 death for each component. It is not 1 (i.e. every transfusion does not save* a life), but I don't know what it is. | *Neither blood donors nor doctors "save" lives; we merely postpone death. Sometimes.	2015-06-18 01:36:36Z	Susan
1276	1278	@dsollen of course in a life-saving situation it's quite likely that multiple units will be needed anyway; also many units are used in cases of severe but not immedtiately life-threatening blood loss.	2015-06-18 09:05:14Z	Chris H
1276	1278	I tried to do my own extremely rough estimation for lives saved per donation.  I'm sure I've missed something in the math.  But just if your interested in seeing my best attempt it's here: health.stackexchange.com/questions/1289/…	2015-12-01 19:34:35Z	
1272	1280	if you are able find out some references and mention that with your answer that would serve the purpose in the better way thank you.	2015-06-18 06:30:32Z	Akshay Vasu
1272	1280	Since all the assertions in my answer are clearly stated as personal experience or opinion, I'm not sure what assertions would require citations or even how to provide them. Would someone care to give me an example of an assertion they feel demands support?	2015-06-18 20:51:28Z	Carey Gregory
1264	1269	"height is genetically based" -> There is certainly a genetic factor, but environment almost certainly plays a role as well. See for example this article. Another interesting is this one; I don't see how a 10cm height difference from 1955 to 2009 can be explained only by genetics. (In North-Korea, unfortunately, the opposite is the case; height has severely decreased since the '50's due to malnutrition).	2015-06-17 15:09:25Z	Carpetsmoker
1264	1269	@Carpetsmoker - You are correct, but that is a societal or cohort trend. On an individual basis, your potential height is determined at birth (Genetics). This can be impacted by a disease state or malnutrition as you indicate, however.	2015-06-17 15:43:47Z	JohnP
1264	1269	Better to say that genetics determines a person's maximum adult height.  But even this is not 100% true.  If a young person develops a tumor that produces human growth hormone, then s/he can grow well past their genetically determined maximum height.  To the extent these tumors have a non-genetic cause, a person's maximum adult height is non-genetic.	2015-06-28 19:08:15Z	Iron Pillow

1261	414	+1 - Good points all. As with any other SE site, references are always much appreciated so that people can read more about something interesting you posted.	2015-04-08 08:43:18Z	anongoodnurse
1261	414	I downvoted this (otherwise good) answer because there are no references. We need to have some evidence for your claims (which I'm sure are true, but we need to know that).	2015-04-08 12:15:10Z	Tim
1261	414	I'll withhold my vote until references are appended.	2015-05-21 00:00:03Z	JorgeArtware
1261	414	I have added the references. Thank you	2015-05-21 05:43:42Z	Rana Prathap
1259	7320	Thank you Weezy, that is very helpful. one thing I would add to your list is that acupuncture has helped me to cope with it more than massages. The people at the acupuncture place had been pretty helpful. I'm pretty lucky to have them close to where I live.	2016-07-06 18:17:02Z	
1259	7320	Yes any kind of massage releases muscle tension. Physiotherapy is very beneficial too.	2016-07-06 18:19:06Z	Weezy
1258	1281	Downvoter, care to comment?	2015-06-18 00:04:23Z	Carey Gregory
1258	1281	Hmmm...I guess the downvoter didn't have the intestinal fortitude to come forward.  All in all, this seems like a perfectly good answer, except possibly the lack of citations, which frankly, would not have caused me to downvote this answer, even if it were posted before I joined this SE community.	2016-03-01 06:39:54Z	BillDOe
1258	8820	Hi! Your question is exhaustive and provides some interesting insights. Would you mind adding some references to support your claims? Thank you. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-14 21:14:29Z	M. Arrowsmith
1248	1257	+1 - Great answer. But medical heresy, it's not. There are risks associated with antihypertensives which cannot and should not be minimized. This is an important question (and answer) which has been brought up with increasing frequency of late, I believe.	2015-06-15 05:55:11Z	anongoodnurse
1248	1254	appreciate the very thorough answer;  "One would not expect, for instance, that blood pressure lowering would decrease death by motor vehicle collision, homicide, or cancer" - off the top of my head - all would be good if we could say that it does not affect those causes of death. Example: blood pressure went too low due to medication, person lost consciousness, we have a car accident on our hands that would not have happened otherwise. Reported cause of death is ... ? All just indicating difficulty in conducting this research, but that's why I asked the question.	2015-06-14 15:16:22Z	
1248	1254	Alternatively: blood pressure went too high (in placebo man), stroked out, developed a visual field cut, veered into oncoming traffic....the point is just that it's an unpredictable relationship, and most likely 99% of MVC deaths have nothing to do with it. So it adds noise to the outcome signal (cardiovascular death) that does have a plausibly unidirectional physiologic relationship to the intervention (BP meds). Doesn't mean it's unimportant, just hard to study. I agree, though, it would be nice to know. Next time I have my genie on hand I'll ask him. ;-)	2015-06-14 15:25:35Z	Susan
1248	1254	I'll do some more searching, too. There might be something of interest to you out there on mortality directly, especially if you're willing to consider observational data (well, there's plenty in that case - I just don't really trust it).	2015-06-14 15:32:42Z	Susan
1248	1254	@Joe Thank you for pushing me to improve that. The data are there. I was so busy complaining about how difficult the methodology is that I failed to actually do a thorough search. :-)	2015-06-15 01:11:45Z	Susan
1247	1576	Hi Chris. It is possible to get enough calcium from just vegetables, but it would be a monotonous diet. The article states: "In Asian countries, the major sources of calcium are derived from vegetable[s]... fish and shell fish with edible bones, fins and shells, etc." That is relevant. Also, "Humans are strange... in making dairy products such a large proportion of their adult diet." That's because we can. Cats and dogs can't milk cows or make cheese, but trust me, many would drink milk and eat cheese every day of their lives if they could. So please, no conspiracy theories. Thanks.	2015-07-16 01:29:49Z	anongoodnurse
1247	1576	My reference to other mammals was intended to raise the question why humans should be uniquely unable to stay healthy without dairy product consumption.	2015-07-16 18:39:33Z	Chris Jenks
1247	1576	After the mutated gene for lactose tolerance appeared in humans in Turkey, it spread faster than wildfire, it was so helpful to European mankind. We can stay healthy without milk; it's just harder, that's all. Not a great medical mystery, just a propitious genetic mutation.	2015-07-16 20:15:54Z	anongoodnurse
1247	1604	There are some great points in your answer (such as the remark about absorption and oxalates)! However, I have two concerns: 1. "we don't need more than 1g of calcium per day". Who's we? The OP is asking about the value for children, and the study you linked seems to refer to adults. 2. Recommending someone to eat 15 slices of bread a day would require to know a lot about their build, diet, energy expenditure etc (it's not exactly a universally healthy advice). Perhaps you could rephrase that part so it doesn't sound like a direct recommendation? Otherwise, it's a good answer :-).	2015-07-19 16:34:17Z	Lucky

1239	1241	I consulted with a doctor and he prescribed me some pills. He also suggested me to put powder over the affected skin before wearing socks....I have also started to the apply the combination of neem oil + castor oil + mustard oil on the affected skin and the pus discharge has stopped for now. Waiting to see improvements	2015-06-15 14:10:03Z	
1238	1918	Just a point - If you eat in a large excess of your daily caloric needs, you will gain fat, whether or not you are eating healthy.	2015-08-20 15:07:57Z	JohnP
1238	1918	Yes, I agree but as his BMI is low, so putting on a pound of fat won't be that much harmful. And, I am also trying to put on some serious weight :-)	2015-08-20 15:47:44Z	ABcDexter

1237	1243	@jiggunjer - If you feel the question is bad enough it shouldn't be answered, then you should probably vote to close it. Currently it has one upvote and no votes to close.	2015-06-15 15:16:36Z	JohnP
1237	1243	@JohnP - Well maybe it could have been improved so I am often hesitant to vote for closure immediately.	2015-06-15 18:53:20Z	jiggunjer
1237	1243	@jiggunjer - I see that you also recommended a way to improve the question, which I think is great! If you think it's a poor question, you can also always downvote, and you can reverse both your own downvotes and closure votes if they do improve the question. Appreciate the input!	2015-06-15 21:22:52Z	JohnP
1236	1250	you give no citation for your claims specifically claiming that all diets are "flawed." Some information like eat less and exercise more is common knowledge, but to make such a broad claim about all diets requires some sort of evidence to back it up.

1218	1228	As a side note, the "improved neurological outcomes" come from keeping the blood pumping by manually pumping the heart for them. Instead of trying to restart the heart, you do the heart's job, which has the same effect of keeping the patient alive.	2015-12-30 20:25:45Z	Nic Hartley
1218	1228	@QPaysTaxes - Hmm, I thought that was clear from my answer, but I see now that it's not. Thanks for pointing that out. I'll edit accordingly.	2015-12-30 20:28:17Z	anongoodnurse
1213	1215	Urine is also a way of removing excess water. I say this because one urinates more when they drink more water.	2015-06-17 05:31:12Z	Tshepang
1213	1215	Based on survival training I've had (albeit many years ago), I don't believe your answer is entirely correct. The avalanche survival site you linked to agrees with what I was taught; ie, that drinking the first two "passes" is safe and will extend your survival time, but after that it will be detrimental for the reasons you cite. It's also unlikely you will have more than two opportunities anyway. If you're in a situation where drinking urine has become your only option, it's unlikely you'll produce more than one or two full bladders anyway.	2015-08-25 22:13:01Z	Carey Gregory

1205	1212	if Cetaphil is good, then why does it feel burn when I apply it to the scratch I make?	2015-06-11 05:58:31Z	
1205	1212	Because you have broken the epidermis and the mild detergent stings. Does other soap sting?	2015-06-11 11:57:11Z	anongoodnurse
1205	1212	does it matter? Cetaphil is the only soap I have been using so far, and I still have a bottle left so I don't intend to buy a new brand. But if it matter I will try to make an experiment.	2015-06-12 14:43:53Z	
1202	1240	If you ever watched Marketplace (they invent medications and get approval from Health Canada for them quite easily) you'd place less faith in their approvals. But on the strength of this answer I've bought a tube of Ozonol and am trying it on an infected bug bite. It smells old-fashioned-mediciny which I'm guessing is the phenol. I will report back in a day or two.	2015-06-14 01:11:17Z	
1202	1240	@KateGregory I can't say that I'm familiar with Marketplace, but when something is proscribed by law I don't expect a governmental (regulatory) agency to break the law (and I hope that I'm at least partly right - one can always doubt, but then you could also doubt any provided reference and that might lead into an endless regress argument). I know that regulatory agencies sometimes have oversights, but that is usually about the quality of a particular series and it doesn't occur often (and as soon as it is noticed, procedures to withdraw the product from the market are set into motion).	2015-06-14 11:09:30Z	Lucky

1202	1240	The Ozonol seems to work almost as well as the Dr Chase, and certainly better than Polysporin, so I'm going to accept this answer, thanks. (BTW 40 years ago they didn't put expiry dates on anything, so there isn't one on my old ointment.)	2015-06-25 12:14:01Z	
1201	1203	Thank you, this answers my question nicely. Now all I have left to worry is that the treatment won't work; at least the side effects are not a problem.	2015-06-09 14:44:28Z	
1201	1203	I already accepted it, because it's such a good answer. But I realized that I'm still curious about one more aspect of the timeframe. In patients who get the adrenal suppression, when do the side effects disappear? At the end of the tapering? Later? Are there permanent ones? Would you mind adding that part?	2015-06-10 05:21:00Z	
1201	1203	@rumtscho I realize this is an old question, but your follow-up would also make a good question, I think! (I only know from personal experience, tapering isn't particularly pleasant)	2015-12-12 08:31:26Z	YviDe
1198	1547	Okay, I've added a clarification to Question.	2015-07-14 09:10:49Z	
1198	1547	I'm not sure how you dug up this gem of a study - good work! The dosage has a wide margin but knowing that somewhere in the vicinity of 3.5-14ml of 50% liquor would cause 94 mg/dl concentration is still a useful data point. In the 187 mg/dl case, the girl recovered after a day (so, the body dealt with the toxin), but we don't really know in either case how brain development was impacted. As for the reddit thread, yes, it just defines what is normal but doesn't add much beyond that.	2015-07-15 01:53:51Z	
1194	1210	I agree with your answer although it doesn't point to he mint-like herb. May I suggest a more reputable source on cloves. You can always edit your question to improve it :-).	2015-09-30 21:41:59Z	Lucky
1191	1225	This answer does not mention AC vs DC. It does not mention that the path of the current is also important. 100A running through your finger will cook it, but won't kill you. The conclusion also doesn't follow logically if you say 60mA is the 'lethal threshold' then 30mA should not be lethal.	2015-06-11 16:29:51Z	jiggunjer
1191	1225	@jiggunjer I tried to clean it up. I agree there are a lot of factors. Standing in a bucket of conducting liquid may not be the use case the OP was considering, but I started with the worst case. I have now added a less than worse case condition.	2015-06-11 16:40:27Z	StrongBad

1187	1193	Well, I just realized I've spent the entire day researching Soylent. I think I'm going to cry (tears of joy). I'm also going to cry (sorrow) because they don't ship to Canada. This is what I'm looking for. It's not perfect, but who says you can't drink Soylent and eat real food concurrently. This is the future, albeit in its early stages. It just sickens me how they've decided to be exclusive to USA. Even more so, I researched at least five companies that ship from US to Canada and the reviews are all 0.5 stars. My hopes were high, and now my dreams are destroyed. I will obtain Soylent one day	2015-06-09 03:00:59Z	
1187	1193	What reason do they give for not shipping to Canada? It wouldn't shock me to learn they they put uppers in Soylent, because it would certainly make you love the product. Do you have links on this? I'm curious to learn more.	2015-06-09 19:11:51Z	Joshua Frank
1187	1193	They don't give a reason, but their website says USA only, no international orders. If there's amphetamines in Soylent, the creators are going to jail for the rest of their lives. There's definitely no illegal drugs in Soylent and I gaurantee the border people just made that up. Take a look here:	2015-06-10 00:59:55Z

1166	4438	Yes, these are just three of many, many tests for cancer (doesn't include lung/pancreatic/breast/ovarian cancer or leukemia just to name a few)  This doesn't answer the question which was whether there is a blood test to test for cancer.	2016-01-18 14:53:38Z	YviDe

1133	1139	Hi Dave! I'm leaving this as a comment because I don't have a reference on hand, but, with many things, the difference between powder and capsule isn't quite as simple as that. There are situations in which a capsule is preferred in terms of the timing of delivery into your system. Also, some powders need to be mixed with liquid, and are therefore dosed differently. As for probiotics, there are many kinds, which increases the number of variables for consideration.	2015-06-04 02:12:37Z	Sue

1130	1132	This is good information. Still, my main point was a bit different, maybe I was unclear. I know a vaccine won't save me from illness from an already-happened bite, but I think I will be exposed to more bites from ticks from an encephalitis endemic region in the future. I would hesitate to get the vaccine if I don't have symptoms after 15 days based on the incubation info only. First, I could have been exposed without getting sick, and second, the German Wikipedia says the encephalitis can be asymptomatic.	2015-06-03 15:06:39Z	
1130	1132	I am also somewhat confused that you discuss Japanese encephalitis when it seems to be mosquito-borne. Tick borne encephalitis is a different but related disease with its own vaccine. Japanese encephalitis is also prevalent in Eastern Asia where I won't be; I will update my question with relevant information.	2015-06-03 15:10:21Z

1128	1305	I love the Soylent Green comment. And I agree with the points, but I think the fact that no one has given a single reference for this question at all so far just show how little we can say on the subject at this time. I'll leave this up, since the liquid fad will make a resurgence even if Soylent dies. Also, @michaelpri, I don't know if that should be enforced unless someone can fully answer the question at all. (So I agree with Susan here.) Otherwise, yes.	2015-06-20 20:37:21Z	
1128	1324	Before flaming me for omitting references, be aware that I have a different philosophy about this website.  I want you to go off and do your own reading.

Don't trust me, or anyone else except your doctor.	2015-06-20 23:50:14Z	Iron Pillow
1128	1324	Eh. If I contribute to science, then my life was worth it (but I don't eat a lot of Soylent and my recipe changes with cravings). I agree with your opinion on references too. However, links to the cravings and the egg on toast story would be cool. Also, supposedly it's not ice, it's crunchiness, which in the old (as in almost pre-fire days) meant bone, which meant marrow which is full of iron.	2015-06-21 15:03:13Z	
1128	1324	Nice point about the crunchiness, and maybe it is true, but even if it were, the misdirection to ice highlights the pitfalls of a 21st-century human trying to interpret cues that evolved on the African savannah a million years ago.  BTW, geophagia (eating dirt) is also quite common in iron deficiency, and it is not very crunchy!	2015-06-21 22:27:01Z	Iron Pillow

1123	4637	@HDE226868 I understand your point, but I'm not sure how I can "reference" basic math and unit conversion. What part of my answer would you say needs citing?	2016-02-04 15:55:42Z	nhinkle
1119	1121	How would using weight make more sense?  It's got exactly the same problem: one cup of rice weighs X when dry, but it weighs Y when cooked with water.  You're still confronted with the question of "I just ate 100g of cooked rice. Should I input 100g, or 50g because that's how much it weighed dry?"	2015-06-02 21:11:48Z	
1119	1121	@nerrolken My point was less about your specific rice conundrum and more about your app by itself. It is either not intended to calculate calories with any precision, or it wants to but fails. The usual nutrient database treats "cooked rice" and "raw rice" as different foods and lists them separately. A less-complete database may only list one of them, but will make sure to spell out which one it lists. There is no answer to the question "is it calculated pre- or post preparation" because both calculations are common, they need to be labelled.	2015-06-03 08:17:27Z	rumtscho
1119	1121	@nerrolken because if you put your cup of rice in a blender it will be half a cup of rice, but still weigh the same.	2015-06-03 17:06:13Z	jiggunjer
1119	1121	@jiggunjer I'd argue it won't be rice anymore, but will be ricemeal or rice flour.	2015-06-03 17:34:22Z	Random832
1119	1121	@Random832 the semantics are irrelevant, the nutritional content is given for an ingredient and just changing the shape does not affect that, but the point was it may change the volume. Ergo using weight is superior, in practically all cases.	2015-06-04 07:32:31Z	jiggunjer
1116	1144	Ha. It didn't cross my mind that it might be that simple. Good thinking! Upvoted.	2015-06-03 21:11:47Z	
1116	1144	Though I must say that the phrasing "Also be wary of fish canned in oil. Bad news!" sounds pretty severe, I wonder if there's anything else to it.	2015-07-11 13:52:31Z	
1115	1136	I would have thought the answer was a resounding no, so +1 to both you and the OP for teaching me something.	2015-08-28 19:10:50Z	Carey Gregory
1115	1136	However, white lithium grease isn't pork lard so I don't think your MSDS reference applies. I think food grade white grease is what OP is referring to.	2015-08-28 19:18:15Z	Carey Gregory
1108	3808	It's a shame this has answer so few upvotes. When I came looking for this StackExchange Health site, I was sincerely hoping for a community that puts emphasis on evidence-based healthcare and skincare as opposed to the countless other online sites and forums that advocate "natural", "alternative" medicines whose efficacy aren't scientifically proven and that can actually be harmful. The amount of upvotes this sourced, reasonable answer has, in contrast with the amount that the question has - which already seems to have made its mind up about the plant's efficacy - is telling.	2017-03-20 01:26:32Z	Hashim

1099	1142	+1 for thinking alike, esp. on the part with the thirst. As @Iron Pillow also pointed out, you can drink, in a short amount of time, so many more calories and sugars than you'd probably have done with sticking to whole fruits.	2015-07-05 19:17:11Z	cirko
1099	1142	These articles compare fruit to fruit juice, not smoothies, which is a bit different than what OP asked. So far I haven't seen any studies which would show what mechanism would alter the food's GI when mixing and drinking compared to simply chewing it.	2016-08-04 07:27:46Z	Lou
1099	1142	@Lousy the mechanism is related to the speed of digestion. The less breakdown your digestive system has to do, the higher the GI. Nobody can predict the exact number, but the rule is that a whole fruit has a lower GI than a smoothie of the same fruit (because the step of breaking down cell walls is skipped) and that a juice has even higher GI than the smoothie, because the sugar doesn't have to be separated from anything else, it just gets into the bloodstream from its already-dissolved state without any more steps.	2016-08-04 10:49:35Z	rumtscho
1099	1142	@rumtscho: the rule is that a whole fruit has a lower GI than a smoothie of the same fruit - that's exactly the rule I would like to see backed up. Also, many sites claim that "breaking cell walls" (if this is even a thing, since I don't see the difference between a thoroughly chewed apple slice and the same slice blended for a couple of seconds) actually helps release more nutrients. Again, I am not saying your answer is wrong, I am just saying there should be sources regarding smoothies.	2016-08-04 11:28:14Z	Lou
1099	1454	Nice answer. Any possible links?	2015-07-04 04:54:28Z	anongoodnurse

1098	1102	That's a great point about the potential ramifications of not being able to provide proof of what you have and dosing instructions. I keep a card in my wallet with those details, but that doesn't mean doctors would adhere to it. It also occurred to me that since the drug names aren't on the pills, an emergency situation could hinder the doctor's ability to provide proper care.  I also appreciate the advice about the cotton. I often end up throwing pieces of pills away because they're no longer the right size for the dose!	2015-06-01 15:01:48Z	
1098	1102	@Sue - if you carry around your med list with dosages, a doctor will most likely believe you (as long as there aren't drugs with a high abuse potential); I would.  Also, all drugs sold in the US are identifiable by size+shape+color+markings. For example, a mysterious, simple orange pill marked WW112 on one side is generic doxycyxline 100 mg. (Google "drug WW112" and you'll see), so that doctors can quickly identify overdoses and accidental ingestions. This is not true for all supplements, though. :-)	2015-06-17 23:26:57Z	anongoodnurse
1098	1102	Hi! After asking this question, I did some research and posted the results as a comment to JKA99. Apparently, your concern regarding authorities extends to even local doctors! Thanks again and to @lucky too, for all the input.	2016-01-01 19:57:31Z

1098	4260	Hi! After posting the question, I consulted my prescribers who said even though the half pill remains effective if properly cared for, it may not be easy to identify. My ER trauma doc said it's not his job to search through a bottle of pills and match them to a list. In Massachusetts, some, like seizure meds, can't be administered without the label, and he's had to let patients go into withdrawal until he can reach the prescriber. That's scary, so I only mix the supplements and otc now! Thanks for the answer, and for coming to the site. Have fun here!	2016-01-01 19:51:28Z	
1098	4260	Hi Sue! Wow, that ER doc is really strict! It's super easy today with computers to identify even half a pill. Any doctor who would allow a patient to go into withdrawal because he couldn't identify a pill is, well, something I won't write here. However, having a prescription bottle is different from having a pill; you can get a pill from anyone; it doesn't mean it was prescribed to you. :_)	2016-01-01 20:02:05Z	anongoodnurse

1096	1118	Hi, Francine, and welcome to the site. Do you have a good source for your answer? The SE model favors answers with sources that others can read if interested.

If you would like more information, you can see this meta post	2015-06-01 22:16:26Z	JohnP
1096	1118	Hi JohnP.  Perhaps I'm confused as to the purpose of the site.  Is this site for medical academia?  Who visits the site?  I had been assuming it was "people with a medical condition who want advice on what to do for it".  I suppose if this was a clear-cut case of "there's a definite cure and here it is" references would be available but as far as I can tell in my research there are a few common cures (holding your breath is one) but mostly everybody has their own method.  Hiccup cures that work for one person may not work for others.  And it risks nothing to try different things :)	2015-06-02 22:45:07Z	Francine DeGrood Taylor
1096	1118	I'm not meaning to be argumentative, I just thought that my answer might be useful to someone who was looking for a good cure to a recurring problem.	2015-06-02 22:47:16Z	Francine DeGrood Taylor

1063	1923	Interesting comment you made about sleeping prone because the body craving extension of the low back.  I sit for long periods during the day so that may be why I gravitate to sleeping prone.	2015-08-23 23:47:55Z	
1063	1923	I once had to sleep on my stomach due to an injured tailbone. The pain was cringing for 3 whole weeks and I could not sleep on my back at all and sleeping on my side hurt as well. But sleeping on my stomach was comfortable. Ironically this lead to me waking up on my back, the most painful position for an injured tailbone. Even when the pain significantly decreased, I still slept on my stomach until my tailbone was fully healed and then I started sleeping on my side again.	2017-05-21 01:28:08Z	Caters

1058	1085	Hi and welcome. I took the liberty of editing your post to meet SE standards and to attempt to explain metabolic lactic acidosis in a way most of our users will understand. If you are unhappy with any of it, or find errors, please feel free to edit or roll back. Thanks.	2015-05-29 04:35:14Z	anongoodnurse
1058	1085	Hi I think your answer is missing a few things: 1) you state nausea is induced by a receptor in the brain sensitive to pH, so why is this nausea not more common in athletes? Do only people with a particularly weak circulation system build up a low enough pH to trigger the receptor? Or are some people just more sensitive to low pH? 2) You made a typo, compensatory respiratory alkalosis increases pH.  3) Lactacte is not an acid, it is a conjugate base. I believe the proper explanation for pH is decrease is due to release of H+ from excessive hydrolysis in the glycolysis reaction.	2015-05-29 08:41:19Z	
1058	1085	4) You don't mention how a full stomach or other factors may contribute to this phenomenon.	2015-05-29 08:41:28Z	
1058	1085	@jiggunjer - typo corrected, thanks. Should it be more common in athletes? The reference you chose specifically stated it wasn't. The H+ is explained. Maybe you can explain why you think it's caused by something other than lactic acid production? Clearly you know about this topic. I'd be interested in hearing it (in chat?) Finally, it is your claim that a full stomach causes the nausea, not Wiki's or your reference article.	2015-05-29 14:37:59Z	anongoodnurse
1058	1085	@anongoodnurse I will add more info to the question later regarding variables of interest (points 1 & 4). As for the exact mechanism of acidosis, it is not crucial to this question/answer but I will try to access the chat to expand on what I know about it. The lactate explanation seems to be a common mistake, even in some academic settings.	2015-05-30 10:02:25Z

1037	1062	I just want to point out I approve of this answer as well (+1), and really struggled with what the appropriate "depth" in science to include. For example is going into catecholamine too much?  In the end I decided yes, and for a lean answer I think this is spot on (couldn't help the pun, I will punish myself accordingly).	2015-06-01 04:57:37Z	Atl LED
1030	1141	Informative, thank you. So it sounds like you're saying the chain of events is possible, only extremely uncommon?	2015-06-03 21:11:01Z	
1030	1141	Would you have any idea on what percent of pregnancies would end in such a way? Percent twins times percent in the same sack times percent with the head and limb arrangement? (And I assume all limb+head arrangements would end with the baby with the limb born second?) Thanks.	2015-06-03 21:32:10Z	
1030	1141	Yes, baby with the extended hand would be born second. No, no idea on how often this would happen - too many factors (ruptured membranes vs one ruptured/one not, "roomy pelvis", etc. etc. Clearly, it happens, or there wouldn't be literature about it; clearly it's not common, or doctors wouldn't be surprised and caught off guard when it does (which they do). This is a case where midwives would be less taken aback than doctors, I think.	2015-06-03 22:26:30Z	anongoodnurse
1030	1141	Can you clarify the part about "if the story is told without pauses"? I don't quite understand the details of what you were getting at there. Thanks.	2015-07-08 20:40:30Z	
1030	1141	@AL- It sounds like the whole thing took only a couple of minutes. I'm saying that births don't happen in a couple of minutes - they usually take much longer. Just being overly careful, that's all. :)	2015-07-08 22:24:29Z	anongoodnurse

1014	1015	a very thoughtful answer. Thank you so much. Just for clarification, I ask this question because I want to, like you said, learn some knowledge. I have eczema, so maybe learning steroid is enough; but if someday I got a stomach disease (or some popular disease), and in the drug description it says the drug belongs to another class, I will have some good knowledge ready in my memory.	2015-05-19 17:05:09Z	
1014	1015	Wow, I read the question and (while it’s a good one) I wasn’t sure it could be answered in a meaningful way. You proved me wrong. This is really insightful. (I’m not sure about SSRIs for migraines, though. Occasionally venlafaxine (technically an SNRI) is used for prophylaxis, but for treatment did you mean the serotonin agonists, triptans?)	2015-05-20 03:28:30Z	Susan
1014	1015	@Susan it seems that I unwittingly provided a case for my own point. My relevant area of expertise here is information architecture, and I easily wrote an answer which you suggest would have been hard for a physician to formulate, but at the same time I mixed up my categories when it came to giving a real medical example. Thank you for catching that, I updated the answer to use serotonin agonists for the example.	2015-05-20 19:26:09Z	rumtscho

1014	1407	@Ooker it would help a bit - not just the information you have, but also the way of thinking required for natural sciences. But still, trying to master all drug classes is huge - to understand how a medicine works, you need to understand how healthy body works (physiology) and how the illness works (patophysiology). The classes you could learn about - the ones you already use.

956	971	Hi, your answer covered all the aspects which I wanted to know. Really appreciate that. still I can the down-votes, even after editing the question. I think now this question seems fine and not ambiguous. If so and if you don't mind, can you please help me to remove these down-votes? Thank you.	2015-05-15 05:43:01Z	
956	971	I am not sure what you mean by reliable sign. Cessation of the menstrual period does not mean you are pregnant.	2015-05-15 16:11:03Z	StrongBad
956	971	@StrongBad - The question assumed conception has already taken place. In that case, it is a reliable sign. But I will edit that in.	2015-05-15 16:31:03Z	anongoodnurse

956	971	There is another indirect early sign of pregnancy which can be appeared before cessation of period - basal temperature changes. The thing is – your blood circulation changes in order to consider the new life in you. Your basal temperature may raise and you may feel hotter than before. Most probably you won’t notice if you have things to do. 10 first signs of pregnancy	2016-04-13 08:14:45Z	Seo Bro

932	935	Good answer. Maybe it is worth mentioning explicitly that, even when a partial memory loss of past events happens (the third point), there is no way for the doctor administer the therapy to control which events are forgotten, by age or by anything else.	2015-05-12 18:39:07Z	rumtscho
946	950	Hello and welcome. You seem to have some valuable information to contribute, but, your post needs references to reliable sources in order to be considered a good answer on this site. (Please flag for removal of post notice if you’re willing to edit accordingly.)	2015-05-12 21:20:17Z	JohnP

929	969	I haven't looked at those studies carefully but I wonder: Did those studies find that electric tooth-brushing is better only because manual tooth-brushers don't do it carefully, thoroughly, and long enough? If for example two guys both brush their teeth carefully and thoroughly for 180 seconds morning and night, but one uses electric and another manual, will the electric guy still have better teeth?	2015-05-16 14:16:05Z	Kenny LJ
929	969	@KennyLJ One of the problems with experiments like these is that there are many variables people don't consider, such as effort put into brushing. The main point is that it is easier to get a fuller clean when using an electric toothbrush as opposed to a manual toothbrush. Hope that clears things up :)	2015-05-16 18:26:10Z	michaelpri

922	923	Note to other users who will read that: I know that this is not written in the impersonal tone we expect from StackOverflow answers. I feel that this is a case where the OP needs to feel emotional support instead of a simple treatise. If you feel it must be deleted, please give the OP the chance to read it in this form first. Alternatively, I can edit it into a more impersonal style later.	2015-05-10 11:11:33Z	rumtscho

922	923	Wow, I know that this doesn't fit how we usually should answer here, but I really like this answer. Thank you for this wonderful contribution :) p.s. I hope you don't mind that I edited in links to the books you mentioned.	2015-05-10 15:11:49Z	michaelpri
922	923	@michaelpri and anongoodnurse, thank you for the support. Of course, I don't mind the links, they are an obvious improvement. I'll think if I can either add more info specific to memory, or write the usual "dry" answer separately.	2015-05-11 09:43:06Z	rumtscho
922	923	@FranckDernoncourt that's a great question, but answering it in a comment is practically impossible. Why don't you post it as a separate question over on CognitiveScience.Stackexchange? They are also a beta and love new interesting questions. Also, they can explain it better than I can. But the shortest answer is: we have no idea how memory works. And it goes downhill from there.	2015-05-11 09:45:10Z	rumtscho
920	927	Hello, welcome to Health.SE. This seems like it could be a very good answer, but it lacks explanation. Could you please go into more detail? Also, your reference doesn't seem to be extremely reliable as it is a wiki. Could you possibly try to find better, more reliable sources. See here and here for more on that. Thanks :)	2015-05-11 02:32:55Z	michaelpri

919	1304	Just because vit D is produced in the skin, it does not mean that the production is regulated in the skin. It might be regulated in the brain, where lots of similar regulations happen, and the brain senses the amount of available sunlight in a nucleus located right above the eye nerve, which measures the light streaming in through the eyes (independently of vision). So there is a possible mechanism by which the amount of vit D produced is changed dependent on the amount of light which reaches the eyes. I don't know if this exists or not, but dismissing it as "won't exist" is premature.	2015-06-20 07:50:18Z	rumtscho

I'm no longer employed by them, but I feel uneasy talking about stuff that is potentially confidential - like the formulation of Axe. What sources would you like me to cite? Toxicity data on ethanol is just a Google away, though I suspect finding publically available deodorant formulations would be harder.	2015-05-13 10:30:24Z	John Rennie

908	910	The downvote was probably because you don't cite many reputable sources. This site encourages using high-quality sources such as original research papers. If you could point to a few studies that suggest fructose can be harmful in massive doses, I'm sure you'll get plenty of upvotes.	2015-05-08 22:03:26Z	Dave Liu
908	910	Your source is a blog site run by someone who profits from "your chance to start enjoying [his] high-quality natural products." Also, the references he cites - which makes it appear that he's using science to back up his claims - are all self-references. For profit medical websites are not trustworthy references.

908	910	The OP asked, "Are fructose, glucose, and high fructose corn syrhop all damaging to health if consumed in portions common to processed foods?" Three references didn't address that. The OP is aware there are different sugars and is asking if, at "normal" levels, they are deleterious to health. Answers which are direct answers to the OP are generally regarded more favorably, as are answers with better references to support the main point.	2015-05-11 12:45:12Z	anongoodnurse
908	910	@DaveL Where did you see that original research papers are necessarily high-quality sources?	2015-05-13 20:16:12Z	Franck Dernoncourt
908	909	If you've read something, this site encourages you to cite it and make sure it's a reputable source, not a company-sponsored report or something. Since your answer doesn't cite anything and go into detail, it received downvotes. I hope you can improve this and don't get discouraged, it can be hard to write a good answer, but when you have credible sources and explain thoroughly, answering will feel and be rewarding. Also, those people who downvoted may come back and switch it to an upvote.	2015-05-08 22:11:29Z	Dave Liu

902	1112	That study says sodium chloride is not healthy, is that saying it is unhealthy in any amount? A dangerous claim.	2015-06-01 12:52:42Z	jiggunjer
902	1112	@jiggunjer Taken in context of the average American or UK salt consumption, I think it is safe to say that in the vast majority of cases, consuming additional salt would in fact be unhealthy.	2015-06-02 05:21:57Z	March Ho
902	1112	That is not what point 4 is saying @March Ho. It says sodium chloride is not healthy for humans. It should just say: in this case natural only denotes a different source, not composition, ergo natural is not healthier.	2015-06-02 07:16:57Z	jiggunjer
902	1112	@jiggunjer I removed point 4, seeing that I don't personally agree with it much either (see them calling sodium chloride metallic in the same point).	2015-06-02 07:17:46Z	March Ho
900	1577	Hi Chris! I've read some of your answers and notice that you tend to use long quotes in your answers. I appreciate that quotes answer questions, and it takes some work to find quotes.

892	905	Thanks, JohnP! I still think it might be possible to study more directly, but this is a good start. (Incidentally, I think that article may be just wrong when it claims a “half-life of alcohol.” My understanding is that alcohol follows zero order elimination kinetics. The term ‘half-life’ is meaningless in that case (or, if you prefer, it varies by concentration...which makes it fairly useless).)	2015-05-08 11:21:07Z	
892	905	@Susan - Also appears to increase in efficiency, suggesting that elimination can be "trained". Wonder if that holds true (or has been studied) in other medications?	2015-05-08 14:44:51Z	JohnP
892	905	It is/has/does, particularly with the hepatic cytochromes. Drug-drug interactions are frequently due to induction/inhibition of this enzymes. Alcohol is an inducer of the same enzymes that metabolize it, hence the “training” effect you mention.	2015-05-08 14:53:22Z

891	1593	Because the redness occurs immediately after plucking, I'm tempted to believe it has little to do with infection, but perhaps a lot to do with a mild local inflammatory response? Or can infection appear that quickly? I've not looked into it. Your answer is interesting! I'll be curious to know if it helps the OP. :)	2015-07-18 01:26:08Z	anongoodnurse
891	1593	Thanks @anongoodnurse ! The first part of the response is based on anecdotal knowledge (actually from ladies who wax this area - that prior disinfection reduces the redness, so I hoped it might translate to this procedure) and my own logic. My guess would be that it is a mild local inflammatory response, but that local inflammation is somewhat enhanced in the presence of bacteria. Talc should soothe the irritation after any sort of hair removal - shaving, waxing or tweezing, and since the process of threading is similar to tweezing it should apply to that as well.	2015-07-18 03:36:05Z	Lucky
886	888	I agree that sugar is a very complicated issue.  However, given that sugar-sweetened beverages (such as sodas) are by far the biggest sources of added sugar in the average American’s diet (and are not associated with fats), sugar begins to look pretty bad all by itself!	2015-05-06 23:31:02Z	anongoodnurse

884	889	@servantofWiser, that isn't fat in the belly, it is water.  When there is a lack of protein in the blood because of poor diet, the blood leaks out into abdomen causing it to distend.  A similar thing can happen in liver disease if the liver fails in making adequate proteins, in particular albumin.	2015-05-07 10:38:28Z	Kenshin

876	881	I was under the impression that simethicone causes burping/belching, and flatulence, in other words, it helps you expel trapped gas. Is this compatible with that you're saying?	2015-05-06 12:02:12Z	anongoodnurse
876	881	@anongoodnurse I have not used it myself, but I helped a friend research it once. I know that it is used to alleviate bloating (which, in German, is not even regarded separately from flatulence) and that the mechanism is to let the gas to defoam and move smoothly through the now-slippery contents of the digestive tract and exit the body (see also the source). After your comment, I wonder if the part about the gas coming out less noticeably is part of what I have read, or something I have erroneously imagined. My friend said it helped her bloating/flatulence, I don't know all details.	2015-05-06 13:49:06Z	rumtscho
876	881	I think we are both saying the same thing using different words. I agree, it is used to decreasing bloating. Thanks for your clarification. I'm unsure of how noticeable it is, but I understand what you're saying better. :)	2015-05-06 18:17:33Z	anongoodnurse

(and there might be additional problems present) [although anecdotal, 5 visits to dentist: no bleeds; started it myself: bleeding; revisit to get advice: less and less bleeding as technique improved]. Merely touching the gums should not lead to bleeding, but injury does, repeated and even frequent injury is not good for the gums either.	2017-09-12 07:07:19Z	LangLangC

855	861	@anongoodnurse The CDC page recommends the providone-iodine irrigation for the prevention of bacterial infections that might also accompany the bite.	2015-05-04 22:10:01Z	Fomite
855	861	@anongoodnurse And from that page: "Wound cleansing is especially important in rabies prevention since, in animal studies, thorough wound cleansing alone without other postexposure prophylaxis has been shown to markedly reduce the likelihood of rabies." The OP is quoting verbatim.	2015-05-04 22:17:09Z	Fomite
855	861	@Fomite - I agree that washing the wound is important. My intent was to have the OP edit "soap and water" into the answer: "All postexposure prophylaxis should begin with immediate thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water. If available, a virucidal agent such as povidine-iodine solution should be used to irrigate the wounds." - CDC. Also, we do not irrigate with providone-iodine for animal bites in the ED. (The use of providone-iodine is very much restricted compared to 20 years ago.) There is no literature to support it, and some against.	2015-05-04 22:42:41Z	anongoodnurse
853	1827	I still think that this needs some more explanation. The OP asked for more specific information than you give. Could you add in some more info?	2015-08-10 04:33:34Z	michaelpri
853	1827	1) with me, the correlation between posture and pain is decent, the fact that it's weak overall des not help me much 2) the pain I'm worried about is a cinched nerve (not muscle soreness, that's ok), also I don't understand what you are telling me?

852	854	Please don't be offended, but your reference looks like a high school experiment to me. It appears that there was one subject only (at least there was no mention of number), and the test consisted of placing the subject's hand in a beaker of water of differing temperatures. Your answer would be well served by use of better references.	2015-05-04 18:47:12Z	anongoodnurse

837	873	There were already studies in the 1930's in both Germany & the U.S. suggesting lung cancer and a reduced life span (but most of it was from Germany). Germany even outlawed things like smoking in public buildings, trains, and such out of concerns for second hand smoke (!)	2015-05-05 01:16:06Z	Carpetsmoker
837	873	@Carpetsmoker - I agree that there was evidence long before, but there were methodological problems. I do like this 1938 paper in Science, though. Immunity?!	2015-05-05 01:41:49Z	anongoodnurse
837	873	@Carpetsmoker As I said, it very much depends on what you mean by "evidence" - those are the results I found from my exposure to the epidemiological literature, but if you've got earlier - well, that's material for your own, better answer, is it not?	2015-05-05 02:03:27Z	Fomite
837	873	@anongoodnurse Thanks for the link. And yeah, there wasn't a single "aha!" moment; there rarely is with this sort of thing. Evidence grows over time... I have half an answer written, not sure if I have time to finish it any time soon though ;-)	2015-05-05 17:04:17Z	Carpetsmoker
833	883	And what happens when the effects of caffeine dwindle? How much caffeine should one take to maintain the desired blood pressure and what are the risks associated with this? I had to downvote such an off-hand answer :-(.	2015-09-17 14:18:25Z	Lucky
831	850	I like your input, but it seems you only address the first study. Is that right?	2015-05-04 09:50:40Z	
831	850	The answer only addresses the first study because (if I understood the poster correctly) it's a clinical trial of the specific product in question. I assumed that the others are similar products, which would be less relevant.	2015-05-04 10:19:42Z	octern
831	850	The first was is the one that supports the 92% claim (I think). I'm not sure if the other studies agree or not...	2015-05-04 13:57:08Z	
825	865	I have been examined by a doctor and declared normal, but often I feel my heart beating then not beating, then beating again, even though when feeling my pulse the rhythm is regular and stable, with a normal rate.  Perhaps this is just my perception changing at different times?	2015-05-05 07:44:44Z	
825	865	We can't customize answers to fit every particular situation. We would need a lot more information, which only a qualified health care provider is capable of gathering and applying to your particular situation. If you are particularly worried, there is the option of ambulatory (event) monitoring.	2015-05-05 15:35:17Z	anongoodnurse
825	865	I know this is an old question, but is feeling a second, lesser beat through the chest right after the main one normal? It feels exactly like those videos where a heart beats, but would you feel that? I only feel this when stressed.	2017-07-17 00:16:43Z	APCoding
825	10100	Thanks Laura, I didn't down vote but "heart racing" isn't really relevant to the question.	2016-11-15 07:43:15Z

819	828	Hi @aparente001! We expect answers to be backed up with references, as explained in this meta: meta.health.stackexchange.com/questions/1/… - Would you edit your answer in a way claims can be vetted by the community? Thanks!	2015-05-02 16:50:54Z	Shlublu
815	830	1+ Good job on the answer definitely, its well supported and everything. However, doesn't being cold lower your immune system? I know the other answer mentions that and that does seem like something worth while to mention.	2016-02-16 04:07:38Z	Pobrecita
815	830	@Pobrecita I doubt that being cold "lowers your immune system" (whatever you imagine that means). Being cold often is sure going to make you weak in general since you need to invest valuable nutrients in order to maintain homeostasis, then you're probably more likely to get sick if infected. But there are many other things that make you weak and are known to lead to sickness, such as stress, heavy exercise, malnutrition...	2016-06-09 13:37:13Z	Tomáš Zato
815	830	@TomášZato I agree with Pobrecita's point. Your body puts more resources into staying warm when you are cold, and this lowers the immune system. At least that's what I've been told.	2017-01-22 13:11:08Z	Celeritas
815	830	@Celeritas That's really imagining human body like a sci-fi spaceship that freeky moves ennergy from "motors" to "shields". Not even real means of transport work like that. How do you imagine "lowering immune system" would work? Converting leukocytes to heat? I doubt that.	2017-01-22 13:50:11Z	Tomáš Zato
815	830	@Celeritas yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof - medical claims are to be proven, not disproven. I don't know how exactly it works, but I highly doubt it's as simplistic as you describe.	2017-01-22 13:58:58Z	Tomáš Zato
815	845	This is the study Cardiff refers to: It is a small study; the authors also relied on self-reporting and state: "The  results  of  the  present  study demonstrate that chilling  is  associated  with  the  onset  of  common  cold symptoms but the study does not provide any objective evidence, such as virology, that the subjects were infected  with  a  common  cold  virus." In any case, it has been suggested elsewhere that a subclinical infection may be converted to a clinical infection with cold exposure.	2015-05-05 16:11:37Z	anongoodnurse

814	4407	The OP is asking very specifically about when the tar is expelled from the lungs. I don't see how your post answers that, I'm afraid.	2016-01-16 09:00:45Z	YviDe
808	829	Since the link said "Full text" I thought it had the full text, and not a synopsis of the result. The 92% claim is in the promotional material from the spray.  Meanwhile I found some other "similar studies" (I think), and asked a more broad question. It's here, if want to have a look. Thanks!	2015-05-03 06:48:05Z	
797	805	so 3500 calories only equals a pound of fat (on average) if you lose muscle mass for instance, I'm assuming that muscle would have less calories, you would end up losing a lot more weight with the same calorie deficit than if you were losing fat?	2015-05-01 03:01:39Z	
797	805	Also are you saying that it is true and correct? your tone indicates that you think that this isn't the case.	2015-05-01 03:02:30Z	
797	805	We can discuss this in chat, comments are for improving questions/answers, not extended discussions. :)	2015-05-01 04:00:07Z	JohnP
797	805	Asking if you believe the conclusion to be true/correct seems a good improvement of the answer.	2015-05-01 07:43:36Z	Paul
797	805	@Asmani - There is no way to tell, especially as the 3500 calories is not correct to begin with. Also, when you lose weight, it will not be exclusively muscle or fat, it will be a combination. Also, it will vary from person to person.	2017-11-20 20:39:55Z	JohnP
793	803	So say you weigh 100 lbs you eat 1lb of fat which has 4000 calories, your body breaks down what you ate and turns it into energy to use in various things such as making body fat (and muscles and what not) and you could end up (ignoring all other bodily processes) weighing over 101 lbs? right? ie. your weight will increase as your body processes this lb of fat.	2015-05-01 01:31:49Z	
793	803	@Aequitas, by the law of conservation of mass, you can't gain more weight than the weight of the food + water you consume, and you will usually gain much less weight than the weight of the food you consume.	2015-05-01 12:22:56Z	Kenshin
793	803	@NinjaDoc I was going to invoke the laws of physics too but then it occurred to me that food A could potentially cause the body to absorb and store food B more readily than it would without food A. I know of no examples of such a food, but I suppose it's possible.	2015-06-18 18:33:35Z	Carey Gregory
793	803	@CareyGregory - There are nutrients and macros that enable and enhance (as well as detract) the absorption of other nutrients. One prime example is that in a completely fat free diet, you will run into vitamin deficiencies as there are vitamins that rely on fat for transport (fat soluble vitamins).	2015-06-18 18:55:18Z	JohnP
793	803	@NinjaDoc - The same reminder. Comments are for clarifying a question or answer, not arguing with another user. Please move this to chat, as I will be deleting the comments once both parties have had a chance to review.	2015-06-30 14:47:38Z	JohnP
793	4604	Do you have references to support your assertions?	2016-02-01 02:08:28Z	JohnP
793	4604	@JohnP Added references.	2016-02-03 22:30:17Z	Chloe
793	13192	Please do add some references	2017-08-01 18:54:41Z	L.B.
793	13192	As @L.B. says, references supporting your atoms assertion would be great. I can say with great certainty, that if your daily caloric needs are 2,000 food calories, and you consistently eat 3 pounds of food with a caloric count of 4,000 calories you will permanently gain much more than 3 pounds. (Not the day to day fluctuation, long term permanent weight gain will ensue.)	2017-08-02 02:55:56Z	JohnP
793	13192	I am not sure which of my assertions require references. Much of what I stated is basic biology and logic. However, if you will identify any questionable assertions I made, I will endeavor to provide a reference. A couple of laws I used, but did not state: 1. Mass(atoms) cannot be created or destroyed by chemical or physical changes in the body. The atoms can be rearranged into different molecules, but their number and type(atomic #) does not change. 2. In the absence of nuclear fission,fusion,or interactions with dark matter, mass is not changed into energy and energy is not changed into mass	2017-08-02 20:59:20Z	Ray L.
793	13192	JohnP. I think we are in complete agreement. Where things become cloudy is that not all molecules store the same amount of energy. If I eat a pound of digestible protein or digestible carbohydrate, I am ingesting about 1816 calories. If I consume a pound of digestible fat I am getting about 4100 calories. If I need 1816 calories/day of energy to perform all of the endothermic reactions in the body, then I would need to eat either 1 pound of pure protein/carbohydrate per day or a little more than 1/3 of a pound of pure fat. So, If I ate 1 pound of digestible protein carbs/day, my weight would n	2017-08-02 22:22:15Z	Ray L.

787	804	I would caution against blind trust in some of these. For example, the Mayo Clinic has an article that repeats the bad 3500=1lb formula. mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calories/…	2015-05-01 02:02:26Z	
787	804	It's a rule of thumb - not blind trust. That's why the other two points stand about looking at the peer review.	2015-05-01 02:05:43Z	Jack
789	790	A support bar will lead to other problems though: without the support bar, you can use your entire arm to move the mouse. With the support bar, you only use your wrist, leading to wrist problems. The pad also puts pressure on the wrist, compressing the carpal tunnel which also causes wrist trouble.	2015-04-30 14:30:52Z	
789	790	Yea, I hate the things personally, I just put up with the discoloration... but actually, I still only use my wrist/hand, don't move my arm around at all...	2015-04-30 14:31:40Z

782	3087	This would fall under the category of the "common knowledge" exception for citing references. This information is very well known.  I literally didn't have to look any of this up, except to look up the active ingredient in the "Detol anti-bacterial soap" that was mentioned in the original question...	2015-09-11 23:53:32Z	Beth R.
782	3087	I'm not familiar with the particular soap, and I admit that I didn't look it up myself, but if you only listed the ingredients in a product that the OP already knows about and some other products that contain it, or just wrote some general knowledge, how does that help the OP? The common knowledge exception refers more to some information in an answer (i.e. you don't have to have a reference for every single sentence), but it isn't meant to support whole answers without references: meta.health.stackexchange.com/questions/112/…	2015-09-12 01:29:04Z	Lucky
782	3087	Okay. I'll look for some references that include and/or expand on the information above. Will add it soon... Thx.	2015-09-12 19:36:55Z	Beth R.
782	3087	I just added some references to the Mayo Clinic website page for "Seborrheic Dermatitis" (dandruff). It includes a discussion of the over-the-counter options described above, and also contains a lot of other helpful information.	2015-09-12 20:36:17Z	Beth R.
780	785	How is reducing DOMS a health benefit above just feeling good? Is DOMS a health risk? This does not answer the question asked.  The studies cited are good beginning points, but their sample size is too small to prove your claim that "massage can reduce some of the after effects of intense exercise sessions" and leaves all the legwork of determining truth or fiction to the original asker's knowledge of sample size. Implying that this is a complete answer ignores the more pertinent health benefits of massage, and leaves the reader to assume that there are no other benefits.	2015-08-25 22:18:16Z	Dr. Duncan
780	785	@Dr.Duncan - Pain reduction is one of the most common and important functions health care providers provide. If you have other valid objections (it seems to me there's a bit of a peeve in your comment), please state them objectively.	2015-08-28 05:13:27Z	anongoodnurse
780	1931	As requested, I have taken a look at the question and answer, as well as the comments and discussion. I think that this answer only peripherally answers the question. It is a collection of links with no interpretation or summation, so if the links die the answer is useless. Additionally, the research is not totally proven, and leaves all the legwork of determining truth or fiction to the original asker. As such, it is a fairly poor answer (In my opinion). I think it could be made into an excellent answer if the pros/cons/ambiguities are cleared up.	2015-08-24 19:24:23Z	JohnP

747	751	+1 for a good question and that excellent answer. I'd maybe add near the "potential cardiac arrest" that in that case, extra emergency measures (cardiac massage & mouth-to-mouth air influx) have to be taken very quickly (within 3mn, to better avoid cerebral damages).	2015-05-13 12:36:14Z	Olivier Dulac
747	751	@OlivierDulac Thanks a lot. This is absolutely right, and this would make the answer too long (and broad) at the same time, as this would be switching from the 'seizure' to the 'CPR' protocol, which is another question on its own. This is why I just said this would be another question in my answer. However, this may deserve a footnote explaining that... do you think it would help? Let me know, and if so I'll edit my answer accordingly. Have a nice day!	2015-05-13 14:53:08Z	Shlublu
747	751	I believe it deserves a footnote. and please add to my 2 measures the 3rd necessary step I forgot to mention: someone (a 2nd person than the one doing massage&mouth-to-mouth) needs to call the emergency number so that proper care can arrive quickly. maybe with also a link to the cpr protocol?	2015-05-13 18:13:19Z	Olivier Dulac
747	751	This is a great answer. Two things: we turn people onto their side and hold/prop them there. If they bite their tongue or vomit post-ictally, they won't aspirate. In the US, it's illegal to drive within 6 months of having an unexplained seizure (not caused by eclampsia, hypoxia, head injury, etc.). You can't force someone not to drive, but you can strongly discourage it. I'm legally bound to notify the DoT for every unexplained seizure. It's not ethical for a person with uncontrolled seizure disorder to get behind a steering wheel. If you help them through a seizure, help them in that, too.	2015-05-14 17:20:42Z	anongoodnurse

735	736	+1: good answer, and good analogy at the end. For the future, may I suggest: try to use plain English ("wound") instead of medical jargon ("laceration"). This might get you more upvotes in the future.	2015-05-22 16:19:36Z	unforgettableid
735	736	@unforgettableid - but I don't close all wounds; 'wounds' covers a large variety of injuries. Most people understand "lacerations". It's not really jargon. Jargon is language that is purposely difficult to understand, a way of excluding others. I am not trying to do that. But I do thank for your concern. :)	2015-05-22 17:52:35Z	anongoodnurse
735	736	Not really, my experience with professional cleaning of teeth is that you will almost always feel pain and bleeding. My dentist says is necessary and that only good hygiene habits will stop the bleeding and pain with floss. And i don't think they will use anesthesia just for that	2015-07-05 22:15:05Z	Freedo
732	733	Good answer! Answers without any references (not hard to find), though, are like long comments. Editing in references would make it an even better answer! Thanks. :)	2015-04-27 17:04:06Z	anongoodnurse
732	733	Thanks! 3. tends to mitigate rather than supporting. Is this why you explain this is a precautionary measure?	2015-04-28 06:27:27Z	
732	733	@Shlublu, yes spot on.  There isn't a lot of evidence that there will be increased lymphodema, but I described the reasoning behind the practice as a precautionary measure.	2015-04-28 06:36:12Z	Kenshin
732	733	That's even better like this. "Why" is one thing, but "this is why, and here are the boudaries" is way more interesting.	2015-04-28 06:41:10Z	
715	716	Something I would like to add to this in the past I have been given a prescription for something that is over the counter because the doctor can give further instructions with it.	2015-04-26 19:47:41Z	Joe W
715	716	Of course drugs which are OTC can also be prescribed. At least in Finland, prescribed 100 pills of paracetamol 1g cost the same as 30 pills of 500mg paracetamol. Again this is just a precaution, so if a person has a continuing need for paracetamol, he/she will likely see a doctor eventually to get medication with lower cost.	2015-04-26 19:57:19Z	arkiaamu
713	4532	Good answer but you didn't directly address Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome which would get my +1	2016-01-27 15:49:35Z	Atl LED
713	4532	The presence of bacteria doesn't equal clinical disease so you didn't actually answer the question. That's a very long list of references without links that I would have to spend the entire evening finding and reading to find out if you actually did answer the question. So as Atl said, it needs work.	2016-01-28 01:13:43Z	Carey Gregory

713	722	Thanks, but I was interested in knowing what corpse of studies published in peer review medical literature could be considered as proof. As a patient myself, I already know the answer :)	2015-04-27 14:28:17Z	
713	722	Hi, Iron Pillow. Nice to have your input! I really liked your answer (as a doc, I thought, as did @Susan, that there is some good stuff there), but I'm retracting my upvote for the following: "I didn't read these articles, so I have no idea if they back me up or not."  References are meant to support your answer. How can you possibly use them to support your assertions if you haven't bothered to read them or know what they say? This is a health site. How would you react if you asked a doctor friend a question and he had this cavalier an approach (NB: it's free advice!)	2015-04-28 04:29:51Z	anongoodnurse
713	722	I agree with @anongoodnurse - a high-quality answer here on Health.SE would be expected to include supporting references.	2015-04-28 21:37:57Z	Nate Barbettini
713	722	@IronPillow - "Citing references is not a panacea." Agreed. But not citing sources is a poor practice. You state, "Anyone who reads an answer here and does nothing else is asking for trouble." True, but what does this have to do with site policy that references should be added to support answers? I'm confused. You seem to regard good answers as important. Please see this meta post.	2015-05-04 23:14:58Z	anongoodnurse
711	993	The reference in Wikipedia about smoke point is weird. Refined olive oil has a high smoke point, but virgin and extra virgin has lower than what they claim. Note that their 191 C has "citation needed". See for example seriouseats.com/2014/05/…, the article there uses numbers from Modernist Cuisine, one of the most scientifically thorough books in cooking. Also, I have personally seen olive oil pyrolising at temperatures much below 191.	2015-05-18 10:50:33Z	rumtscho
711	993	So, your answer is true, but it is beside the point - the OP asked about the health problems created when the oil is "heated" (it is likely that the citation assumed heating above the smoke point). You simply said "you shouldn't" but in practice, everybody overheats olive oil when cooking with it - I have observed it in my kitchen, with friends, and with recipes which just cannot stay below the smoke point when cooked properly. So a good answer would not assume that the oil is not heated above the smoke point, but explain what happens when it is heated above it.	2015-05-18 10:52:52Z	rumtscho

696	702	Calling it "food poisoning" (or the even older term "ptomaine") predates the germ theory of disease. Food poisoning can be either due to bacterially produced toxins, or due to upper GI infection by bacteria in the contaminated food. As Dave says, food poisoning is a syndrome with multiple causes - infectious or toxic.	2015-04-29 13:12:35Z	DrRandy
694	9772	I don't buy it.  The Bradford paper studied persons with a disease of pigmentation called "segmental vitiligo."  It is quite a leap to say that the mechanism (and cure) of grayness in segmental vitiligo is the same as in common age-related graying.  Here is a similar example: premature graying is a well-known sign of pernicious anemia (Hardgrove et al, Annals of Internal Medicine, 1944) and in that disease can be reversed by vitamin B12 supplementation... but common age-related graying cannot be reversed by B12 supplementation.	2017-10-09 07:03:03Z	Iron Pillow

694	14285	Welcome to HealthSE! Thx for your answer. We require reliable references to backup your claims so that anyone can check them.  For hints and inspiration on what scientifically reliable sources might be please refer to this meta-post and please read the help.	2017-11-10 15:22:13Z	LangLangC

682	3095	Welcome to health stackexchange :-). The blog you cited offers an interesting perspective, but since it isn't peer reviewed, I don't think it can be considered a reliable resource. For a general idea what resources might be considered as reliable, please see this meta question. For other information, browse through other meta questions and the help centre. You can always edit your post to add other resources and information. Thanks!	2015-09-11 17:53:40Z	Lucky
682	3095	I like the source, and I believe it's the best given lack of scientific studies. The log answers the question well, but the posted answer given does not. @xcosmi, you need to explain what the log says about polyphasic sleep, not just point to the link. If you could provide a detailed summary of what Steve wrote in his logs along with his "long-term consequences" caution, I'd accept this as an answer.	2016-01-31 21:54:59Z	
668	670	I've found that weight can easily fluctuate by as much as 500 grams from "noise" such as how recently you've had a drink, meal, gone to the toilet etc. 100 grams is completely inconclusive. Comparing your weight daily is a pointless exercise. A better method is to weight yourself daily at the same point of your routine (e.g. always before breakfast and after morning toilet visit), with the same clothes (or lack of) and form no conclusions from it. Write it down and calculate the average once per week, then use that as your basis.	2016-03-22 15:43:23Z	JBentley
668	5702	Welcome to health SE :-). You were right to reference your answer, but there is a policy that references should be as reliable as possible.

666	680	Plaque in the arteries is a long term, not short term effect. Most US based blood banks don't have any restrictions on smoking before donating, but they do recommend against smoking after donating to prevent dizziness and possible fainting. Can you provide a reference that shows smokers blood puts the recipient at risk?	2015-04-24 22:19:52Z	JohnP
666	680	You're right that there's no definitive proof of risk. I've readjusted my answer to claim "possible risk". Thanks for pointing that out.	2015-04-24 23:08:44Z	Dave Liu
666	680	Cigarette smoke contains absorbable compounds that increase platelet aggregation and promote clotting. This may also be a reason to avoid donating blood after recently smoking.	2015-04-29 13:19:43Z	DrRandy
666	680	Blood is drawn from veins, not arteries, and smokers bleed just as well as non-smokers, so plaque making it difficult to draw blood is not an issue.	2015-06-17 21:46:21Z	Carey Gregory
666	680	I don't think it's accurate to make that extrapolation. Cigarettes have several negative effects on the vascular system, but I don't think any of them are significant enough to hinder blood donations. As JohnP said, the effects are long term, not short term.	2015-06-18 01:40:42Z	Carey Gregory
665	707	The mechanism description is off-topic, and can be safely ignored.	2015-04-27 03:43:56Z	Iron Pillow
665	707	Hi there Ninja Doc, there seems to be some great information here, but we encourage citing reputable sources. If you could provide some, that'd be great, thanks!	2015-04-30 20:43:32Z	Dave Liu
665	707	@DaveL - weren't you talking in the chat the other night with me about how to encourage more users to this site.  While references may be appropriate, your downvote only deters me from making more contributions.	2015-05-01 07:48:13Z	Kenshin
665	707	@NinjaDoc I'll mainly downvote things that I think can be easily fixed, but that I don't have time to edit myself. Otherwise I don't think the person will care about fixing the answer. I do believe that voting to close things too fast would be discouraging, but downvotes that potentially turn back into upvotes are more of a "stimulant", if you will. :) The downvote also serves as a placeholder to help me check those items. So yes, I believe in encouraging more users, but also motivating them to improve quality, as I wish upon myself. I don't think Downvotes are permanent rep loss, I hope?	2015-05-01 08:33:05Z	Dave Liu
665	707	@DaveL, not they aren't but most people never remove downvotes.  I think  this is fine but you should probably state that you will remove the downvote when fixed.	2015-05-01 08:49:21Z	Kenshin
663	986	Cirko, that you for humoring us by adding some references; we appreciate it. Post notice removed. In addition to backing up your answer, this gives those who would be interested in learning more somewhere to go.	2015-05-18 10:35:34Z	Susan
657	658	How would pre-modern, non-dairy, non-fish eating peoples ever have gotten enough calcium? If they didn't, were they any the worse for it?	2015-06-13 20:52:12Z	Joshua Frank
656	659	Thank you for this explanation (the diagram helps a lot).  I can't tell if you're saying, in your final two paragraphs, that (a) no there's no fluid exchange even without a lens (maybe the aqueous flow/pressure is enough) or (b) without a lens there could be mixing and thus more risk of consequences of vitreous loss.  Thanks!	2015-04-23 21:03:05Z	
656	659	@MonicaCellio - Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, with the lens removed, there will be exchange of fluid (I thought you were referring to normal aging.) I was indicating option b. I can edit... Thanks!	2015-04-23 21:05:41Z	anongoodnurse
656	659	Thanks!  I was asking how the normal consequence of aging interacts with the abnormal absence of the lens, 'cause it sure seemed to this layperson that this would mean that eventually you'd end up leaking your vitreous out through the channel normally reserved for the aqueous.  I guess you then end up with aqueous filling up that space.	2015-04-23 21:12:00Z	
656	659	@MonicaCellio - I'm not quite sure that's an option, but now you're aroused my curiosity. I will try to answer, but most of that literature may be behind a paywall, even for me. No harm trying, though.	2015-04-23 21:16:23Z	anongoodnurse
656	659	Thanks for the edit!  I didn't know that the liquification happened from the center out; that would seem to delay any negative effects further.	2015-04-23 21:17:11Z	
652	3354	Thanks for a great information. However you should add your own interpretation to your answer, otherwise it's risking of being removed. See: meta.health.stackexchange.com/q/210/114	2015-10-07 09:16:51Z

650	651	@Fomite - Duly noted and edited.	2015-04-23 19:04:05Z	JohnP
649	701	To be noted: Over half of those studies are either lead or co-authored by the same person, who is in the employ of AminoUp (Who is actually listed as the author info for the first study you linked). One of AminoUp's main products is oligonol supplements. There are a couple interesting other studies in your links though.	2015-04-26 05:49:22Z	JohnP
649	701	Good point. I noticed the recurring authors and conflict of interest note at the bottom, keeping it in mind, but should probably mention that in the disclaimer too.	2015-04-26 05:53:12Z	Dave Liu
649	701	That might be a good idea :) Also, I'm not familiar with all the magazines that publish studies, but I don't recognize most of the ones that these are published in. I'd have to see if @susan or anongoodnurse has a better handle on their reputation.	2015-04-26 05:55:21Z	JohnP
649	701	Fingers crossed, but many of them are based in Japanese or alternative medicine associations.	2015-04-26 06:10:55Z	Dave Liu
649	701	@DaveL Thanks for your answer. I think another more recent study from 2014 also confirms its safety.	2015-04-27 10:26:13Z	
648	745	Also, wearing gloves when going into cold environments - like food shopping in the frozen aisle, is one of the primary treatment recommendations. Cheap, very few side effects, effective in  primary Raynaud's.	2015-04-30 15:09:50Z	anongoodnurse

644	671	@anongoodnurse I've used it for migraines (I had daily migraines for a few years), but I couldn't find any studies on that particular use. My headache specialist had a "throw the kitchen sink at it" approach to pain control :-)	2015-04-24 14:31:50Z	Zaralynda

628	629	'Cooking doesn't change the overall charge of molecules in food', do you have reference for that? As far as I've read the microwave energy (not sure about conventional cooking) cause polar molecules and ions to rotate and collide inside the food which cause alternating electromagnetic field. See this link.	2015-04-22 15:58:06Z	
628	629	@kenorb en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_conservation	2015-04-22 16:00:00Z	Mad Scientist
628	629	See: Microwave cooking 'polar molecules and ions inside the food will rotate or collide according to the alternating electromagnetic field' and 'the alternating electromagnetic field generated inside the microwave oven would lead to excitation, rotation/collision of polar molecules and ions inside the food'. Which cause changes in the ion orientation and movement.	2015-04-22 16:07:32Z	
628	629	@kenorb that still doesn't move charges out of the food. It's pretty much a fancy way of saying that microwaves heat up stuff.	2015-04-22 16:14:53Z	Mad Scientist
628	629	Thanks for the answer. More references would be welcomed. I'll have to look more deeper into it.	2015-04-22 16:56:37Z

590	596	@Shlublu - I suspect that the user manual changed, or that there is some research that I didn't come across that indicates why it was changed. It's too universal for there not to be a reason, but I couldn't find a specific instance.	2015-04-20 21:11:05Z	JohnP
590	596	I completely agree, there must be a reason. This is what made me ask	2015-04-20 21:18:29Z

585	603	I wouldn't say the confounds are hopeless, especially when we can study different cultures with different drinking customs. In terms of social relationships, I'm sure there are places where gatherings involve heavy drinking, others where they involve light drinking or no drinking, and others where they're more likely to involve other drugs (tobacco, coffee, khat, marijuana, etc.).	2015-04-21 15:30:09Z	octern
585	603	@octern Thanks, that's an interesting approach. I tend to be fairly negativistic about observational data in general for anything beyond exploratory analyses. We don't and can't have randomized controlled trials about seatbelts, but we can and will have randomized controlled trials about alcohol. :-)	2015-04-21 15:35:36Z	Susan
585	603	What is the short answer? "Maybe"?	2016-03-18 09:49:28Z	Roger C S Wernersson
585	603	Nice answer sweetie... +1 see this in chat here on Health chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/65011/ask-a-health-moderator when you get a chance.	2017-09-03 00:41:27Z	Facebook
585	592	Can you clarify whether there is any published research on the hypothesis that moderate drinking is a proxy for social activity? Or is this your own theory? It's an interesting idea, but I'd like to see it tested. The fact that social relationships predict health and longevity has been accepted in epidemiology for at least 40 years, so I'd be surprised if none of the studies of alcohol and health had ever thought to adjust for it.	2015-04-21 15:24:48Z	octern
585	592	@octerm yes a studies do exist on it which I have read some time ago but couldn't find. If you read the studies on alcohol, they don't factor in social factors. They use surveys to ask about alcohol consumption and nothing else.	2015-04-21 16:05:12Z	
585	592	What is the short answer? "Maybe"?	2016-03-18 09:50:19Z	Roger C S Wernersson
583	613	Thanks! Maybe update this for us when the data become available?	2015-04-21 18:05:33Z	
583	613	@Susan It's definitely possible. It looks like there's about a one-month lag before things show up in MMWR. Though if the answer is "nothing changed" it may very well not appear.	2015-04-21 18:07:52Z	Fomite

574	577	Well, the linked reference is from the American Chemistry Council, which is an industry trade association for chemical companies.	2015-04-19 21:30:05Z	Shlublu
574	577	True, but it also includes references to TNO, an independent research organization. They also performed research to find out if any dangerous chemicals where left behind due to exposure to sunlight or heating. They also concluded that this was not the case. Dangers could be related to refilling of canisters and bacteria which might grow after time.	2015-04-19 22:32:25Z	Ropstah
574	577	It might bolster your answer if you found some references other than the Chemistry Council, published on a BPA promotional website.	2015-04-29 04:29:25Z	JohnP
549	862	Thank you. I might have mistranslated it, or maybe the rehabilitators were used to shorten "abnormal lordosis" to simply "lordosis" in everyday speach, but my diagnosis means that I have too much curvature in the lower and upper curves of the spine (what I referred to as lordosis and kyphosis), besides having a sidewards curve in the spine (scoliosis). I don't know 100% if the firm bed recommendation was supposed to help only some of those or my "crooked spine" as a whole, so I mentioned them all, but the scoliosis is the more pronounced of the three in my case, so I made the question about it	2015-05-04 12:39:09Z	
545	550	I see we globally agree :) And it's interesting to see how our guidelines differ!	2015-04-17 16:07:57Z	Shlublu
545	550	@Shlublu - Yes. And I like the addition of the references and differences between UK/FR/US. Makes it a very complete answer. I chose to leave out the pumps, as you say the guidelines differ and in the US, the only people (That I'm aware of) that have those as a rule are those that spend a lot of time in the backcountry where EMS is not readily available. In any case, I think it is still a case of advertising relying on myths over science: wsj.com/articles/SB124208165196508345	2015-04-17 16:11:55Z	JohnP
545	550	Thanks for your feedback. I completely agree, for the pump. I decided listing it as it is actually part of the US guideline but it was hard :).	2015-04-17 16:14:12Z	Shlublu
545	550	@JohnP - Can you share some sources? It would add to this very good answer.	2015-04-18 01:39:36Z	anongoodnurse
545	550	@anongoodnurse - Added detail for you. Sorry, hadn't seen your request.	2015-04-21 16:23:16Z	JohnP

541	543	I've been told by health professionals that mattress firmness is very important for posture, at least for children, and that too soft a mattress can lead to scoliosis. Have you seen such literature while looking at the mattress studies?	2015-04-17 10:26:16Z	rumtscho
541	543	I have to admit, I've never heard that. Scoliosis is an ancient disease, first recorded more than 4000 years ago. I don't know what kind of mattresses they slept on then, but it has been written about ever since. An Orthopedist might have a more informed opinion. I'm at a loss.	2015-04-17 10:46:58Z	anongoodnurse
541	543	I heard this in my childhood, from professionals who grew up in a culture less swamped in information and less wary of bad information. Maybe they were just repeating an urban legend. That's why I thought I'll quickly ask if it's a frequently researched hypothesis - you'd have seen in in your search if it were common. I guess I should ask a separate question specifically about it when I have the time.	2015-04-17 10:56:02Z	rumtscho
531	544	This is a fantastic example of a canonical answer.	2015-04-20 02:09:03Z	Nate Barbettini
522	534	I would disagree with the "logical" items. You can have a perfectly normal blood result, but with markers that trend slowly in one direction or another until they are abnormal. Keeping that history if possible can show the trend and help pinpoint cause or at least origin date. In medicine, any information is good, even if it's negative information.	2015-04-16 19:21:41Z	JohnP

514	515	"That's just not what flu does" isn't really a good answer that meets our standards here (explanation, citation, etc). Can you be more specific?	2015-04-15 12:02:56Z	
514	515	@Zaralynda To be blunt, that notion is also why I don't post on skeptics. I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist, I work on influenza, and to be frank, with NIAID paylines at <10%, people aren't running studies for things that aren't a concern. It's going to be extremely hard to find a reference proving a negative, and it definitely exceeds the level of effort I'm willing to put into disproving some friend's random assertions about a virus.	2015-04-15 15:50:31Z	Fomite
514	515	it seems like an answer that explains that the flu vaccine covers different strains every year and that doesn't change its effectiveness (you either catch one you're vaccinated against or one you aren't) would be an answer, but I'm not a medical professional	2015-04-15 15:58:13Z	
514	515	@Zaralynda Beyond that, I have provided an explanation: If that were true, flu would look like dengue, and it doesn't look like dengue.	2015-04-15 15:58:23Z	Fomite

508	684	Hi @kenorb, you're right! Thanks for catching that, and I'll definitely replace  it since in this case, it's supporting my main claim. I hope to note that if it's not supporting the main claim, it's alright to use wikipedia. Thanks!	2016-02-16 19:56:42Z	Dave Liu

501	512	Oh, and this is why we are instructed not to use the pulse oxymeter in case of suspicion of CO intoxication. To me it was a thing to apply but i didn't know why. Understanding is so much better!	2015-04-15 05:55:10Z	
501	512	@Shlubu Yup, exactly. Standard arterial blood gas measurements (ABGs) also do not accurately reflect the problem of carbon monoxide poisoning, since the O2 dissolved in blood is not substantially affected, only tissue delivery which depends primarily on (hemoglobin-) bound oxygen. There is a technique called co-oximetery that measures carboxy-hemoglobin, most accurately in a sample obtained via ABG. The noninvasive co-oximeters (similar to traditional pulse ox machines) have seen inconsistent validation, unfortunately.	2015-04-15 06:01:17Z	Susan
501	505	More than interesting. And this could explain why my heartbeat decreased by roughly 10 BPM since I stopped smoking.	2015-04-14 21:32:45Z	
501	14927	There's a major logic flaw in your hypothesis. Smoking is not comparable to a low O2 pressure such as found at high altitudes. Being at high altitude for prolonged periods causes your body to produce more red cells in order to carry the same amount of O2. That's the actual mechanism of altitude training. But smoke contains CO, which displaces O2, so the body has no way of compensating. The CO in the smoke will displace O2 no matter how many red cells you have. This also means the O2 sats you think you have are false high readings because CO fools oximeters.	2018-01-10 16:25:11Z	Carey Gregory
501	14927	Ah I see, that is an interesting point! I don't think it entirely refutes the hypothesis but I shall mull over it!	2018-01-10 17:22:32Z	Fredrik Eich
501	14927	There's a great deal of information here, but it completely fails to answer the question that was asked.	2018-01-10 23:05:00Z	Mark
500	503	My usual comment on this is that norovirus, which is definitely something you'll want to wash your hands for, is resistant to boiling/steaming. The only reason to turn the water up is if its too cold for you to keep your hands under the stream long enough to wash properly.	2015-04-14 14:34:46Z	Fomite
500	503	@Fomite - I don't like to cross post; if you would have a look at this - since you mentioned norovirus specifically - it would be much appreciated.	2015-04-15 02:03:40Z	anongoodnurse
500	503	@Nate - +1. Very nice answer. The skin damage hot water does is measurable; the effect of washing hands with hot water on reducing bacteria isn't!	2015-04-15 02:06:42Z	anongoodnurse
500	503	@anongoodnurse On it.	2015-04-15 02:35:07Z	Fomite
500	11346	Legionnaire disease bacteria thrives in your hot water heater at temperatures less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit. So it is vital to keep the water temperature about 140 F to kill it and other bacteria/viruses as well.	2017-02-28 04:40:15Z	S  De  Febles
500	11346	Welcome to health SE :-). The person is specifically asking about washing of hands not clothes or surfaces. Also they are asking for a conformation of facts coming from an unverified source, and you offer no references, so this doesn't really answer the question.	2017-03-06 15:08:30Z	Lucky
498	598	I've had multiple downvotes on this answer but not a single comment as to why...	2015-04-30 10:24:20Z	Ropstah
498	598	I believe that you are getting downvotes because your answer lacks explanation. Why does the absorption of calcium and iron prevent the absorption of iron? You do provide a link, but it is better to include the essential parts of that link in the answer. Could you please do this? Thanks :)	2015-05-30 02:56:26Z	michaelpri
498	598	@michaelpri, i get what you're saying. The questioner asked for scientific research about the matter, I just wanted to point out the original article I knew existed. I added the most important bits of the abstract.	2015-05-31 10:37:55Z	Ropstah
498	598	I upvoted this already, and in this time I guess I won't get any better answer, so accepting it as well. Thanks!	2015-06-07 14:42:49Z

484	540	Please note that there are inconsistencies in your answer, e.g. "therefore causing the scalp to produce more oil to compensate" yet "According to some dermatologists, a gradual reduction in shampoo start sebaceous glands to produce at a slower rate resulting in less oil on the scalp and hair" among others. Also we should strive to use scientific references.	2015-04-16 19:32:52Z	anongoodnurse
484	540	@anongoodnurse - Those statements are straight from the "no poo" wikipedia article.  To me, they are not inconsistent though... The first says that if you shampoo a lot, your scalp produces extra oil. The second says that if you reduce shampooing, your glands produces less oil.  I do think more scientific studies would be good, as would answering more broadly (the OP mentions his hair, but the question was about body oil in general, though this answer focuses on shampoo)	2015-04-17 15:18:26Z	techturtle
484	540	@anongoodnurse How this is inconsistent? When you use soap with SLS, it dissolves natural oils therefore scalp/skin produce more oil to compensate. When you don't or limit usage of soap with SLS, it resulting in natural oil production (at slower pace).	2015-04-17 17:45:23Z	kenorb
484	540	Upvoting because your answer is well-formulated. But if @anongoodnurse wants to write another answer with more scientific references (assuming there are any more out there), I'd gladly upvote that, too.	2015-04-20 10:15:49Z	Nate Barbettini
484	1204	Please try to avoid answering with only quotes. Referencing to a reliable source is a great way to add to the credibility of an answer, but you must also explain how that citation answers the question. Quote-only answers don't add any value to the internet and are a bad practice, especially during a site's beta period. Instead, try to use your own words and experience and relate those to the source.	2015-06-09 17:21:36Z	michaelpri
484	1204	Not that I'm feeling hurt, but doesn't the bolded words answer the question? And while the answer doesn't make any new, it does spread the words, then it must help, right? If it doesn't bring any value, why the readers upvote it?	2015-06-09 17:27:49Z	Ooker
484	1204	It isn't adding value to the internet because those exact words can already be found. I'm not trying to day that you can't use any quotes or that this answer doesn't answer the questions asked, but there should be some of your own explanation of it. This meta post asks us to take action on answers that "consist entirely of links / quotes / or references without bringing any knowledge or expertise to relate them to the question." I'm not going to DV this answer yet because I think it has potential, but I am just asking if you can improve it.	2015-06-09 17:32:52Z	michaelpri
484	1204	erm, is it better?	2015-06-09 17:41:49Z	Ooker
484	1204	A little bit, but it is still just repeating what another site says.	2015-06-09 17:43:11Z	michaelpri
482	485	Excellent precis of a very broad subject. The only thing I would add is that most absorbed iron is used in the bone marrow for erythropoiesis (blood production), and we only absorb about 10-20% of ingested iron. Also, the body has no mechanism to get rid of excess iron other than blood loss, so iron supplementation shouldn't be done willy-nilly.	2015-04-13 16:50:02Z	JohnP
482	485	@JohnP Thanks for pointing them out. I will add them right away. I am expecting more questions on Iron supplementation in this website. So should I go ahead and make my answer a community wiki? At some later point in time, we can make this a catch all for iron supplementation. What do you think?	2015-04-13 16:55:26Z	Rana Prathap
482	485	I'd wait a bit on the community wiki, and see if there are other answers that come up. It's also a bit difficult, as various athletes (such as long distance runners) have other requirements, as the pressure of landing kills RBC's as well. It's a very broad subject :) Plus, I don't think the nature of the question lends itself to a community wiki on iron supplementation in general, as it is asking specifically about iron and O2 transport.	2015-04-13 17:16:50Z	JohnP
474	524	"So every time when you catch cold and flu, you could blame your bedtime." I wish it were this easy, but it's not. Viruses infect us whether we are well or sleep-deprived. However, how one feels - how run-down you feel - may well be helped by better rest beforehand.	2015-04-18 01:30:51Z	anongoodnurse
474	524	@anongoodnurse NHS blamed the bedtime, so do I :) If we're sleep-deprived, the viruses can infect us more easily, as our immune system is weak and this can cause many physiological effects and other health issues.

452	897	can somebody explain why this answer is bad?	2015-05-23 14:12:14Z	Ooker
452	897	@Ooker Cytokine responses, TH1vs TH2 imbalanced responses, depending on which virus is at fault (the break down on Wiki is probably still wrong on viral %, see my Bio.SE on similar subject), the virus itself could be interfering with your immune system (e.g. NS1/NS2 proteins in flu or RSV).  Quite simply this misses a lot of the physiological responses and pathogenesis and deals with only with life style issues.	2015-06-01 02:15:39Z	Atl LED
452	897	@AtlLED if so, can you make a better answer?	2015-06-01 05:29:26Z	Ooker
452	897	@Ooker I decided that Th1 vs Th2 responses was too much into the "weeds" of immunology, but I actually already drafted a paragraph to include the discussion.  You can let me know if you think it should make it into my answer.	2016-03-07 04:11:28Z	Atl LED
450	451	+1 Nice answer, it could be improved by specifying what "thoroughly wash their hands" mean, so this answer may stand on its own.	2015-04-10 03:59:33Z	JorgeArtware
450	451	@JorgeArtware - done. Thanks!	2015-04-10 04:23:41Z	anongoodnurse
450	451	+1. Are there data to support the idea that both are necessary in a hospital, as the premise of the question goes? Your reasoning and references seem consistent about it being better to start with soap and water, but I wasn’t aware that there was additional benefit to sanitizer afterward. (I kind of thought they had both there because they figured it would make people more like to do at least one....)	2015-04-10 09:31:25Z	Susan
450	451	@Susan - There might be a benefit if someone is seriously immunocompromised, but other than that, I can't see it actually being better than proper hand washing. I was responding to the scenario I was given. On the other hand, the way I've seen some people "wash" their hands (a quick flick under water, little or no soap), it might be a good recommendation after all. :-)	2015-04-10 09:40:43Z	anongoodnurse
450	451	@Susan - I didn't really answer your question. The answer is no. In all the reading I've done about hand hygiene, no study concluded that hand sanitizers were better than soap and water, or that both were better.	2015-04-10 09:43:34Z	anongoodnurse
442	445	I take it that a vasectomy doesn't act as STI prevention?	2015-04-09 15:56:58Z	
442	445	The answer depends on the degree of protection as well. Cervical barrier methods do decrease STD's, less so than condoms, but condoms aren't 100% either!	2015-04-09 20:50:36Z	anongoodnurse
442	445	@Tim that depends on whether you consider a pregnancy an "infection" :)  (NOTE:  if you were being serious--the answer is no.  Vasectomy does not offer protection against STIs: webmd.com/sex/birth-control/vasectomy-14387).	2015-04-09 21:43:08Z	msouth
442	445	@msouth well I wondered because I thought some may be passed from the testes. I guess residual bodily fuid pases it.	2015-04-09 22:08:36Z	
442	445	@Tim if you wondered it, it is good that you asked.  I hope my little bit of humor didn't make you feel bad for asking a question.  If you were wondering that, someone else probably was, too.  I don't actually know if there are specific things only transmitted by sperm or maybe extra-facilitated by the sperm's motion.  But I think it's basically like you said--the vasectomy takes the sperm out of the equation, but there is still fluid transfer, skin contact, friction, microtears, etc.	2015-04-09 22:14:42Z	msouth

435	440	The EWG doesn't seem to be an entirely reliable source, especially as they sell sunscreen themselves. The response to the critical article also doesn't really seem to refute anything. You probably should also mention that using no sunscreen at all is a much higher risk factor in developing cancer than the potential danger of Vitamin A.	2015-04-09 12:39:37Z	Mad Scientist
433	434	Hmm, I assume(d) it’s for protecting the patient (she got a high-dose chemotherapy; doctors said she has a very high risk of getting an infection now for some weeks). However, I only had to ask for permission to enter the room once, and they told me to wear the mask/gown and to disinfect my hands whenever I enter, without going into details or explaining it to me; and I could bring my stuff with me. But now that you mention it, it may very well be the case that this protocol is primarily/additionally (?) for protecting others (just in case, as she has nothing contagious for now).	2015-04-08 21:28:57Z	
433	434	@unor It’s either a negative pressure room or a positive pressure room. In the scenario you describe, I agree with you’re initial assessment - it’s almost certainly a positive pressure room, meant to protect the vulnerable chemo patient.	2015-04-08 21:44:37Z	Susan
433	434	@unor - Susan is correct, in that case that you are describing, it will probably be a positive pressure room and they should assist you in the process (At least the hospital I worked in did that).	2015-04-08 22:08:15Z	JohnP

384	415	Thank you, I now understand why my question was not easy to answer. I didn't understand "the placebo effect" was an umbrella term that doesn't necessarily indicate that a patient got better because of psychological bias, but a patient can get better for a lot of reasons and placebos are used only as a method to discard a particular drug being tested as causality for patient's health improvement. I'll leave my question there not to display my previous ignorance but just so others might be educated as I was. (I'm still interested in the bot experiment for the psychological case scenario. LOL)	2015-04-09 07:05:13Z

380	1381	Thanks @JohnP for the link. Yes you are right that we should be cautious but that doesn't make all supplements bad as well. I personally tried spirulina from Elken and could see the results. I chose this brand after listening to my friends who tried it. After using it, the first thing I see is improved digestion. So, I feel that if it works for you and has genuine certifications, no harm. Well at the end of the day, we must admit that we can't be fully sure about the authenticity of a product but then that doesn't mean we won't use them. Thanks again :)	2015-06-29 02:19:36Z	Ruchir

365	366	Nice answer. Some excellent points! A few quibbles. #2: Time spent washing is much more important than temperature. Also, it'll destroy your hands. 3) Tylenol contains acetaminophen and is not an anti-inflammatory; Advil does not and is. Neither will change anything except how you feel.	2015-04-06 12:06:36Z	anongoodnurse
365	366	Anongoodnurse, I've editted my answer. Thanks for the clarification.	2015-04-06 23:12:53Z	Dave Liu
365	366	I appreciate the good vibes. But I also found some dangerous recommendations on your answer. For example the "HOT water" part, you haven't edited that as you told @anongoodnurse ... also, IMHO you shouldn't recommend branded drugs; Ibuprofen should be mentioned instead of advil and Paracetamol instead of Tylenol. ACTUALLY, no drug should be prescribed whatsoever, that's the job of a medic professional/GP, this person was only asking how to prevent from spreading his cold to others. I'm sorry but this answer has so many upvotes and is so wrong that I feel the need to flag it.	2015-04-09 22:01:35Z	JorgeArtware
365	366	Thank you, your answer remains very helpful and now it does not contain bad advice neither spam. I also suggest adding some references. From CDC maybe?	2015-04-09 22:22:17Z	JorgeArtware

365	449	-1 (Sorry; I will be glad to retract my vote when you have corrected the information.) There is no vaccination against the common cold; is your answer addressing influenza? If it is, I do agree with much of what you say; if it is not specific for influenza, then I think you need to reread the question!	2015-04-10 02:14:28Z	anongoodnurse

365	449	I reordered the info to make it easier to read what's more relevant first, what do you think?	2015-04-10 20:15:26Z	JorgeArtware
365	367	I don't understand why you got downvoted so much. Downvotes are for unhelpful answers, by all that I've read, your answer seems useful to me, maybe you should add some solid references?	2015-04-10 00:55:25Z	JorgeArtware
365	367	@JorgeArtware I think because previous version was shorter and I suggested to drink naturally green tea with Vitamin C and Paracetamol, probably my mistake:) At least it was helping for me.	2015-04-10 09:21:52Z	kenorb
360	390	Unsubstantiated. There have been a few studies (Some women may have been reassured by a study that was published in October 2010 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.  In that study, researchers in the U.K. reported that the 5-year-old children of women who drank up to one to two alcoholic drinks per week or per occasion while pregnant were not at an increased risk of behavioral or cognitive problems). While abstaining is the safest course, it is not a guarantee that light drinking will cause problems.	2015-04-07 02:55:12Z	JohnP
360	390	For example: today.com/parents/… (Although, it must be noted that one of the co-authors still recommends abstaining).	2015-04-07 02:58:31Z	JohnP
360	390	@JohnP Found a study on it and edited some info in. Guess you shouldn't always trust the CDC (stupid reliable sources list) :P	2015-04-07 03:04:22Z	michaelpri
360	390	Ah, all that it means is that (as with a lot of health) we just don't know.	2015-04-07 03:14:19Z	JohnP
359	368	+1 for the warning about sanitizing your home. Right now all the "7 places dirtier than your toilet" are all the range, and we are actually seeing rises in numbers of cases of Asthma. I am forever having to tell my girlfriend the risks of sanitizing everywhere - it is all the range to over use them... In fact I feel more confident about my immune system than hers because of the amount of germs I've been exposed to (barefoot in the garden, avoiding detergents).	2015-04-07 10:27:04Z	Tim
359	368	@Tim - absolutely. Had this question been framed differently, I'd have included, "garden, own a dog, visit a dairy farm..." Some "germs" are very good for us. :-)	2015-04-07 16:40:28Z	anongoodnurse
359	368	Please try to avoid quoting someone else's answer as your primary answer. For examples and instruction on how to write a better answer see here: meta.health.stackexchange.com/questions/211/…	2015-09-10 20:31:52Z	Dr. Duncan
357	361	Indeed,  in light of all the research to the contrary, why people continue to believe that vaccines lead to autism is probably the only unanswered question. I'd suggest that "Because research-supported peer-reviewed conclusions don't spread as easily as rumors" is also a valid reason for that. Or, folks just don't know that science has been unable to establish a link, and not knowing that is kinda dangerous.	2015-04-06 07:56:36Z	Tim Post
357	361	Great answer!   One note: I'd consider editing out your first sentence.  "Probably not" makes it incredibly easy to think... "but why take the chance?"  I think the key point follows:  "There is no scientific evidence to date (that hasn't been demonstrably debunked) linking vaccines and autism."  I think it's totally fair to point out that no one has disproved a link, but the opening of "probably not" seems to invite more doubt than is necessary to provide an unbiased view.  (I didn't just edit  myself since the topic can be touchy, and wanted to leave it to your judgement.)	2015-04-06 14:47:39Z	Jaydles
357	361	@Jaydles Yeah, that's a good point. Edited it out, thanks :)	2015-04-06 14:52:27Z	michaelpri
357	361	This answer is right on the cusp of being a patchwork; you do make some effort to relate the links you're providing to the question and explain the conclusion, but the structure is rickety. I recommend dropping the "tl;dr" and opening with a summary which you then go on to back up via references in the section that follows. Finally, your last section ("why do people believe this") appears to be wholly speculative; if you have sources to back it up, please add them.	2015-04-21 01:41:26Z	Shog9
357	361	@Shog9 Edited the answer a bit. Thanks :)	2015-04-21 03:03:47Z	michaelpri
357	565	Drs. Barry Marshall and Robin Warren are still an inspiration to me. Why conspiracy theorists haven't picked that one up is a mystery to me.	2015-04-18 21:58:51Z	anongoodnurse
355	447	Could you expand on these quotes? We don't want a site that is just an exact regurgitation of sites anyone can find on Google. Please do something to make this answer stand out, or it may risk deletion. Thanks :)	2015-04-23 04:41:37Z	
355	447	@michaelpri Improved answer.	2015-04-23 10:50:29Z	kenorb
355	447	There seems to be a problem with one of your quotes: "Research has shown that animals fed alcohol …" links to an e-mail survey about "alcohol-induced blackouts among college students".	2015-04-23 12:33:56Z	Patrick Hoefler
355	447	I suspect that the original reference is wrong. If so, ideally it should be corrected on the NIH page. Maybe an expert could check the reference?	2015-04-23 12:48:11Z	Patrick Hoefler
355	447	Alcohol is also carcinogenic to humans.   According to this Wikipedia article, 3.6% of all cancer cases and 3.5% of cancer deaths worldwide are attributable to consumption of alcohol.	2017-03-20 07:28:44Z	Garrett
347	354	Thanks for your answer. But will constantly using it make my skin gradually produce less ceramide? My skin has weak barrier, will it be worse even if using the moisturizer works?	2015-04-06 13:52:10Z	
347	354	@Ooker - no; unless you live in the humid jungle, you'll always tend toward dry (and therefore susceptible) skin. Right now, there's progress in eczema research. We'll know more in as few as five years even (for science, that's fast.) You can also conduct your own experiments using one side of your body as the "control" (untreated.) If you're worried, stop moisturizers periodically and see if your skin is ok for a while without them. You will not do any permanent damage to your skin using a good moisturizer. You have choices. :-)	2015-04-06 14:10:58Z	anongoodnurse
347	354	Ok. Should I apply the moisturizer after taking a shower immediately, or should I wait for it to dry? I think apply immediately is best, since the water can be hold by the moisturizer. But I think it will make the moisturizer be less effective and shorten the time effect.	2015-04-10 16:28:02Z	
347	354	@Ooker - Your thinking is exactly correct. Just towel dry and apply. It will make your moisturizer more effective. Try it and see.	2015-04-10 19:27:41Z	anongoodnurse
347	354	@Ooker - sorry to take so long! The "shower twice a day" is not to soap up twice; it's to get wet then moisturize twice. People can shower without removing excessive amounts of oil by keeping the temperature of the water lower, showering for a short time, wash only the areas that need to be washed, pat dry instead of rub, etc.	2015-06-09 16:27:50Z	anongoodnurse
343	385	Not sure why this has 4 downvotes. I already upvoted, but would you consider expanding your answer some?	2015-04-21 20:18:32Z	
343	385	You referred to a Stanford paper, can you cite it as well?	2015-04-21 23:59:48Z	
343	385	Yeah, sorry it's not clear, I have it as "annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1355685";, but I'll clarify that.	2015-04-22 23:34:23Z	Dave Liu
343	385	Regarding 2 claims about pesticides(Ps) in this answer. First, why do you say organic Ps decompose better than synthetic ones? This seems like a hasty generalization. Second, the stanford paper mentions there is less Ps on/in food, but this is an average that might be pulled down by organic food that completely omits Ps. The measurement in the organic case should only include products that use Ps, IMO.	2015-05-22 19:31:52Z	jiggunjer
343	385	@jiggunjer organic components tend to decompose more easily due to the nature of their components. You could even consider vinegar or cocoa to be organic pesticides. Synthetic pesticides are things that aren't found in nature, so then if they can't be found in nature, that tends to indicate they cannot be processed by nature, or are hard to, because bacteria, fungi and etc. aren't used to breaking it down.	2015-06-10 17:44:00Z	Dave Liu
343	609	This answer is based on one single review, not even the bigger. Additionally this answer omits the parts of the study that show that organic crops have more nutrients, like Table 1 at page 4 of the study; and focuses on livestock comparisons that don't detect significant differences between organic and conventional.	2015-04-21 15:23:04Z	Attilio
343	609	@attilio the answer is based on reviewing 50 years of literature. You didn't read the article if that is what you think based on some table. You see how it says heterogeneity and yes at all of them except for phosphorous? Like sklivvz says you are cherry picking.	2015-04-21 15:55:55Z	
343	609	Thanks for the all the breakdowns, that's very informative. I ultimately accepted DaveL's answer because his was more comprehensive, but yours is good as well. Wish I could accept two.	2015-04-22 00:01:34Z	
343	591	You seem to be cherry picking the evidence a bit. A very large part of the results in the table are not statistically significant (p>0.01). The remaining results do show a difference, but it's much more specific than you make it. The paper says so clearly, e.g. "When data reported for N and Cd concentrations in fruits, vegetables and cereals were analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals, but not for vegetables and/or fruits"	2015-04-21 10:29:52Z	Sklivvz
343	591	@Sklivvz I'm not cherry-picking, you've cherry-picked, because what I've used was the conclusion part. And the chart clearly shows more nutritional/mineral concentration on the right side, toxic/heavy metals on the left side. So it's a matter of interpretation of this meta-study (which consist >300 other studies and study from 2006) and this is mine (which I've the right to do it). You're welcome to add yours in a separate answer.	2015-04-21 10:51:24Z	kenorb
343	591	cherry picking is when one presents a specific result as general (as you did), not when providing a specific counter-example that proves cherry picking (as I did)! I merely explained my downvote. I encourage you to take the criticism on board and improve your controversial answer (vote-wise). Adding my own answer would not make yours better.	2015-04-21 10:57:27Z	Sklivvz
343	591	@Sklivvz Thanks for the comment and criticism. However this is not a specific result, this analysis is based on 343 peer-reviewed publications and this is what was clearly concluded in the last sentence of the abstract. Therefore I'm just interpreting what it was concluded, so I don't see anything wrong with it.	2015-04-21 11:01:54Z	kenorb
343	591	The paper has a poor abstract and I encourage you to read the whole body, if you haven't done so yet. I've read it, and passages like the one I cited are the reason why the abstract is misleading. It's quite common that nutrition papers (and meta studies) have very low statistical value results (high p-value). It's a difficult subject. This paper shows very few significant results. Most of the other results are no better than "we don't know", but of course, no one wants to write an abstract like that...	2015-04-21 11:12:32Z	Sklivvz
343	573	Downvoting because it is link regurgitation without interpretation/understanding. meta.health.stackexchange.com/questions/193/… (Bullet point #2 from the first list, #3 from the second)	2015-04-20 16:30:53Z	JohnP
343	573	You're only listing point that support a benefit of organic food over convential food, but at least two of the meta-analyses you cite conclude that there isn't a significant health benefit to organic food (2 and 6). Your answer paints an entirely different picture than some of your sources. The GMO part is also not well supported by any evidence.	2015-04-20 17:09:42Z	Mad Scientist
343	573	@JohnP It's easy to say "I don't like this" and downvote. Try to study the subject and to give an answer better than mine! My answer summarizes the work that I've done. If you don't like it, try to improve it. Anyway I've added the "Discrepancies" paragraph to point out all the different findings from the authors.	2015-04-20 22:52:14Z	Attilio
343	573	Unfortunately, you seem to be cherry picking. Showing meta-analyses is not enough. They are large studies, with generally complex and varied results. You need to cite them correctly.	2015-04-21 10:32:22Z	Sklivvz
343	573	I realize it's only one part of your overall answer, but your section on GMOs contains many misrepresentations of GMO tech, most notably that GMOs increase herbicide exposure and harm insects.

334	353	@Pacerier I intended to indicate that anongoodnurse’s answer had proven me wrong about that. But if you want me to explain my initial impression....probably because it seemed like a normal physiologic  variant that isn’t particularly relevant for health and doesn’t require explanation. As it turned out, there was indeed something to be explained, so I was wrong.  It happens. :-)	2015-06-04 14:10:02Z	Susan

318	329	A good answer, +1 :-) but I'd like to add that the situation is a bit more complicated with milk, because while calcium might impair the absorption of iron to a certain extent, proteins from milk precipitate some of the tannines (i.e. polyphenols) and might make them less available to precipitate iron. I don't think there is a specific study about this, but the case with adding milk is definitely not as straightforward as is may seem at first.	2015-09-11 12:48:56Z	Lucky

259	265	For sure it's not 'Indian healing science', as 'science' word is reserved for main-stream modern West science (mainly US/UK), so change it to 'Indian healing medicine' at least. This is how it works on SE sites from my experience. If you use that word, you need proper science study support to backup your claims.

252	266	@NateBarbettini I didn't accept because this answer focused on what to do to a heat burn not why butter is bad.

I do know I can un accept and accept a new answer but a) I don't like doing that because it's liking giving someone a prize and then taking it away later and b) As I said, this is a good answer for what to do if you have a heat burn, but not would butter help on burns?.	2015-04-04 09:44:30Z

Most local guidelines (EU countries, US, Canada, etc) basically look alike as they follow the same international standards, but certain details may differ from a country to another at a given point of time (example: the use of the AED on a baby).

That's corroborated by this study where it was shown that body fat per se doesn't increase with age: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8440839	2015-04-11 18:41:35Z	JohnP
241	267	I have to add a clarifying point of contention.  Your statement of "removing, say, white rice from your diet won´t be good for exercise if they are usually long duration..." simply is not true for everybody.  If you have been in a state of ketosis for some time (say weeks, where is has become your norm) then most people can and will effectively use fat based energy, both stored or dietary.  Personally I always hit a wall at about an hour of fairly hard exercise until I became completely keto adapted.  It is not uncommon for me to be very strong 2 or more hours into a run or bike ride now.	2016-03-10 14:37:13Z	Joe Ruder

It is not uncommon for me to be very strong 2 or more hours into a run or bike ride now.	2016-03-10 14:37:13Z	Joe Ruder

226	258	What about losing weight?  Will this help as well?	2015-04-03 01:35:30Z	
226	258	@Mew I would assume that this would help with losing weight, especially the walking and eating healthy.	2015-04-03 01:38:52Z	michaelpri
226	258	yes I wonder though if weight is an independent factor itself in addition to exercise and diet	2015-04-03 01:39:54Z	
226	258	@NinjaDoc Yes, weight is an independent factor. Losing excess weight will reduce blood pressure. It will also reduce cholesterol levels.	2015-06-20 00:13:47Z	Carey Gregory
226	9093	BMI is a terrible marker to assess someone's health by.	2016-09-06 08:48:24Z	JJosaur
226	9093	Losing weight is the first thing you should focus on to reduce blood pressure. Who said BMI is a great marker or a symptom? It only tells you if you are overweight or normal weight or underweight. You are free to use BMI, body fat percentage, a mirror or whatever other fancy measure to determine you are overweight or normal weight.	2016-09-10 09:51:21Z	Zero
226	9093	That is my point, for anyone that works out with any regularity in the gym they will likely be deemed "overweight" when they are definitely not.	2016-09-12 07:35:15Z	JJosaur
225	375	Hi Kenorb, your links are wikipedia articles and a commercial site. These are not considered credible sources. is wikipedia a reliable source? Some of your more recent answers have been backed by much more reliable sources though. :)	2016-02-12 20:41:23Z	Dave Liu
224	245	There are a lot of marathoners that eat regular food items during events, as do half and full ironman athletes (Events of 70.3 and 140.6 miles respectively). Additionally, there is an entire industry around quickly digested items for endurance athletes (Gu, Stinger Waffles, etc). What to eat as well as when to eat it is extremely variable from person to person.	2015-04-02 18:21:29Z	JohnP
224	370	This is an example of what I talk about above. It's a basic description of the digestive process, with "you could", and "can cause", finalized with a summation of "if you're healthy, probably it won't affect you much", which is a complete guess.	2015-04-07 00:29:57Z	JohnP
224	370	If the best answer is simple information about possibilities, then it should be vote to close as either too broad or opinion based. And the other question that you linked has nothing at all to do with eating before exercise.	2015-04-07 14:53:08Z	JohnP

224	370	I like this answer, +1. I don't think that long-term health risks are the only concern here (although you addressed those as well). I've tried both swimming and yoga less than 3 hours after a (lunch-sized) meal (being young and in good health) and I did both things once and never again, because I felt all the physiology you described above. I simply take the sentence "it all depends on your health condition" as a disclaimer in line with the rules that we don't give personal health advice. If you are in good health you may not have serious consequences, but the exercise still won't feel good.	2015-07-23 22:30:53Z	Lucky
223	15107	We require supporting references here. They don't have to be extensive but they do have to support your main factual claims.	2018-01-25 05:35:02Z	Carey Gregory
223	15107	@CareyGregory I don't understand, at all. My main factual claim is 'it depends'. The issue with demanding 'supporting references' is a question like this is a simple logic question and the answer is not something of a hypothesis, it's a basic proof, a boolean, logical true or false. "Is making your own e-juice healthier" - there was not enough variables given to answer that question so I gave a few possible scenarios and proved the answer could be true or false as well as provided a practical method of determining within personal tolerances the safety of a product produced at home vs a lab	2018-01-25 07:16:05Z	Noah Wood
223	15107	You make several factual claims. For example, most e-juice is USP grade.  Sources supporting those claims are what's expected.	2018-01-25 15:18:40Z	Carey Gregory
223	15107	Ah! Well I didn't expect to need to cite anecdotal evidence as my name appears right next to the post. From what I have seen nearly every e-juice on the market is rated under USP (United States Pharmacopeia) which would make it USP grade, and not reagent or A.C.S. which have objectively higher purity standards (along with a higher production cost and value).  Wouldn't be lower than USP because of FDA regulation, and to grade it higher would be a ludicrous waste of money which businesses are not want to do.	2018-01-25 23:40:24Z	Noah Wood

171	219	Thanks for the advice! I chose the other answer though because it addressed the question a bit more directly. Your response also answered the question, but it strayed a little with describing Melanoma rather than focusing on removal of it and noninvasive moles.	2015-04-06 23:22:42Z	
171	219	+1 - Agree with vast majority of this, but unless it's in a very visible place, most FP's (and certainly surgeons) can remove reasonably sized moles (a FP should not, however - imo - try to remove a melanoma.) In the US at least, anything you excise must go to the pathology lab. The advantage of an FP is cost. The advantage of Derm is wisdom. The advantage of Plastics is appearance. I don't know much about GPs in other countries.	2015-08-07 20:18:48Z	anongoodnurse

154	200	2 comments: Vitamin D content of dairy products varies, e.g. by continent because of different "habits" wrt. fortification/supplements. Bioavailibility of Ca in vegetables depends a lot on the oxalic acid content of the vegetable in question. E.g. the kale you quote is AFAIK low in oxalic acid and its Ca²⁺ is quite well bioavailable. The spinach OTOH often has enough oxalic acid (de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinat#Inhaltsstoffe) to precipitate 3 times as much Ca²⁺ as it contains as insoluble and bioinavailable Ca-oxalate. IIRC also soy beans are high in oxalic acid.	2017-09-22 12:21:18Z	cbeleites

120	190	I'm unsure what the FDA has to do with this particular question. Steroids have been used for decades and their side effects have long been recognized.	2015-04-04 01:26:53Z	anongoodnurse
120	190	@medica it is basically saying as long as whatever agency for your country is looking at for the consumers, there shouldn't be too much to worry about but this don't take all the risk off.	2015-04-04 02:10:43Z	
120	190	I disagree. As I said, the FDA has long known about the risks of steroids, yet they are still widely used. The FDA is not in the position of protecting the public from commonly known side effects. They are in the position of assuring proper labeling. That really is the main role of the agency. If drugs which have unacceptable side effects (i.e. heart attacks, sudden death, strokes) compared to the benefit of the drug, the FDA will sometimes not approve the drug; however, if it's labelled correctly, often the drug will still be approved. See Avandia for example.	2015-04-04 02:18:52Z	anongoodnurse
120	190	@medica you misinterpreting what I meant. What I mean is if they are doing their job correctly, the risk of absolutely horrible drugs coming on the market will be low. That is, physicians can take some solace in knowing the drugs should be okay for human consumption. However, if they didn't care, you would have to be wary of every drug in the market.	2015-04-04 02:25:06Z	
120	190	You do have to be wary of every drug on the market. I can't tell you how many times I've heard patients who took Tylenol overdoses say "But if it wasn't safe, why would the government allow it to be sold over the counter?" This was when Paracetamol was the leading drug for suicide in the UK.	2015-04-04 02:46:38Z	anongoodnurse
113	156	This looks like a pretty good answer but it could be improved with some references.	2015-04-01 18:56:11Z	
113	156	I agree with @JamesJenkins here--it seems like the 'I would trust water from my water bottle more then urine, even if it does contain bacteria from my mouth.' is the crucial question (although I will say that this answer is valuable just by the fact that it points out that bleeding is generally pushing out material, and that with many wounds there would not necessarily be a good reason to irrigate, period).	2015-04-08 16:50:49Z	msouth

109	11631	@Shimmy well, thats fine. The question wasn't about how to prevent dandruff it was about preventing hair loss. Besides, a dry flakey scalp is usually one with less sebum, which carries the DHT. So a little dandruff might actually be a good thing	2017-03-27 22:55:10Z	Unknown Coder

108	112	@MadScientist I'm addressing and mentioning that removal of aloin (and other potential toxic substances) by process of filtration makes it safe for consumption and these drinks are approved by IASC for consumption across UK, EU and so on. If they were toxic for health they wouldn't be obviously approved. Most of the studies of cancerogenicity were done on pure Aloe vera and caused by aloin without the filtration, so I don't know what do you mean.	2015-04-11 12:28:00Z	kenorb
108	112	@MadScientist Changed 'health benefits' to 'potential' if that solve the issue. If you'd like to have more references to health studies, I'll provide soon.	2015-04-11 12:38:18Z	kenorb
108	112	@kenorb - The OP's question was "What are the health benefits and risks of consuming Aloe vera?" Can you please modify your answer such that the bulk of the answer addresses the OP's question? Including risks would add some needed balance as well.	2015-04-23 02:46:28Z	anongoodnurse
108	112	@anongoodnurse OP actually asked which entity is regulating this in previous comments, so I've added it. Process filtration is important to show that Aloe vera juice is actually different from delivered from the plant, as MadScientist commented it could contain the toxic substances and this also covers risk involved (if the filtration wasn't good enough). Definition is also important, as there are hundred of different types of Aloe vera and this needs to be clarified what the answer is about.	2015-04-23 10:14:11Z	kenorb
106	139	Please support with references or remove: " Nosebleed (epistaxis) usually indicates body weakness..." Also, I don't think the OP was asking how to deal with the common cold, but with epistaxis.	2015-04-23 21:00:26Z	anongoodnurse
106	139	@JohnP Did some minor improvements. Excessive bleeding which can cause anaemia is based on information found at NHS, they don't specify how much blood loss is actually needed to cause anemia.	2015-04-24 14:26:22Z	kenorb
106	139	You have not addressed the concern of @anongoodnurse. Considering you are labeling this a primary cause of epistaxis, can you add your references for this claim?	2015-04-24 14:38:03Z	JohnP

88	123	@CareyGregory done. Proteins are not the culprit; medicine reasons in terms of risk factors. Also, the problem is not proteins theirselves, but their excess, as explicitly stated in my answer.	2015-06-28 12:38:09Z	Attilio
88	1381	Not all natural supplements are ok either: iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/…	2015-06-28 16:36:42Z	JohnP
88	1381	Thanks @JohnP for the link. Yes you are right that we should be cautious but that doesn't make all supplements bad as well. I personally tried spirulina from Elken and could see the results. I chose this brand after listening to my friends who tried it. After using it, the first thing I see is improved digestion. So, I feel that if it works for you and has genuine certifications, no harm. Well at the end of the day, we must admit that we can't be fully sure about the authenticity of a product but then that doesn't mean we won't use them. Thanks again :)	2015-06-29 02:19:36Z	Ruchir

80	10249	Welcome to health SE :-). If you are referencing Mayo Clinic's website as a source, can you please provide a link? Also, your answer is rather short - a more detailed explanation would be more helpful to all users interested in this question. Thanks!	2016-11-29 18:37:42Z	Lucky

79	431	@anongoodnurse. I've read that discussion a number of times, but can't tell if the consensus was that WebMd should not be trusted as a reliable source. It's a great discussion, so any misunderstanding is mine, but it would be helpful for me to know if that's what's implied by this comment. Thanks :)	2015-07-13 19:49:46Z	Sue
79	431	Sue, Personally I don't like WebMD. It's not on the list, so I think that might be a consensus.  I would also caution against Livestrong.com (that seems to be a popular site!) If you have a question, the odds are someone else does about the same thing, too, so questions are always welcome! :-)	2015-07-13 20:16:51Z	anongoodnurse

78	84	Is there any scientific evidence for your claims? While your first and second reference talk about apple cider vinegar, they don't mention acne. Your third and fourth reference deal with acne, but they don't mention apple cider vinegar.	2015-04-10 17:01:36Z	Patrick Hoefler
78	84	Also, why does it have to be "raw, organic, unfiltered, and unpasteurized"?	2015-04-10 17:05:24Z	Patrick Hoefler
74	107	Understood that it makes CPR easier. The temporary discomfort part I also understand. Thanks :)	2015-04-02 01:05:38Z	
74	107	@L.B. It's more than temporary discomfort. Backboards have been shown to be harmful and there is zero evidence supporting their most common usage as a spinal immobilization device. Fact is, they cause more harm than good. This is why they've been phased out of use in most of the US. I'll try to find the time to write a more up-to-date answer for this.	2016-07-15 20:02:36Z	Carey Gregory
74	107	@CareyGregory At the time I asked this question, I think people were just beginning to realize the extent of damage that could be caused by them. Now, at least in my area, they are much more likely to be used to for carrying a patient as opposed to placing them on it for stabilization purposes.	2016-07-15 20:35:01Z

66	290	Your only scientifically-backed source here pertains to hair-growth. You have no evidence supporting your other claims. Additionally, longcity and researchgate are both broken links, making your total reliable sources 0.	2016-02-16 00:08:44Z	Dave Liu

57	234	@Zaralynda A potassium deficiency is not directly responsible for causing warts, it can be a contributing factor to outbreaks. The main cause usually is viral infection (such as HPV).	2015-04-02 15:04:56Z	kenorb
57	234	The edits to this post aren't really good, reliable resources. I can find stories on the internet all day of folks who claimed it worked, but that doesn't mean there's anything behind it other than spontaneous remission of the virus or placebo effect.	2015-04-04 11:16:18Z

55	68	I'm not a down or upvoter (yet), but I would imagine the downvotes are because your answer is purely speculative. The mere existence of a study doesn't tell us much of anything, and even if it did only one study wouldn't tell us much about the current state of research, which is what the question is about.	2016-06-16 22:35:55Z	Carey Gregory
52	85	You need vitamin A for good vision, but I don't think that eating more vitamin A will somehow increase your vision (let alone reduce eye strain from a computer screen). A normal diet should get you enough vitamin A. No need to sit behind the computer screen with a bag of carrots... I'm also not sure about the "brighter screen" remark ... my personal experience is that a lower brightness is better, not higher! This page, for example, also says that...	2015-05-04 02:14:37Z	Carpetsmoker

52	85	The answer is correct, especially the first part: When your eyes and your brain concentrate on strenuous processes like reading, your blink frequency decreases, comparable to when reading from a book; and this is supposedly the main cause of eye dryness and thus eye fatigue (assuming that there is no problem with your glasses, i.e. uncorrected refraction errors)	2015-05-18 15:08:41Z	cirko

46	9770	The link you cite provides no sources for its claims. Can you edit your post to include cited studies for each of your points please?	2016-10-26 18:13:32Z	
46	9770	This answer is bad. Most artificial sweeteners contain no carbohydrates (or are unable to be absorbed/processed as carbohydrates). On "high blood pressure & cardiovascular disease" and "Metabolic Syndrome": the bad logic is equating correlation with causation. High blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome are all associated with obesity. If you're eating tons of junk food + diet soda, you dodge the soda calories while eating the negative health effects of an otherwise trashy diet. It might be that people who tend to drink a lot of soda also tend to eat much junk food.	2017-11-06 20:32:14Z	user1258361

46	539	"Dr. Betty Martini of Mission Possible International is working with a law firm out of New York and is conducting a search for victims of aspartame for possible retention as prospective clients." This is a conflict of interest, rendering mpwhi an unreliable site.

45	1841	Welcome to Health SE. Are there any other side effects that could occur from taking too much vitamin C? Also, how spread out should the 4 to 6 doses be? Also, 4-15 grams seems very high. Are you sure that is what the reference says?	2015-08-09 19:44:59Z	michaelpri
45	1841	These are just averages based on some numbers, in reality it's individual thing. I wouldn't exceed 1 gram of Vit. C at any single dose, but it really depends on the person how sensitive he's to drugs, quality of the ingested product and if taken on empty stomach or not. Secondly there is no point to take high doses, it can only cause harm.	2015-08-11 10:26:15Z	kenorb
43	542	That article in Polish (2007, which has only once been cited since it's been published)  doesn't look very reliable to me. Can you find any other sources that point to vaccinations, psychological stress and/or climate as causes of DM type 1?	2016-02-16 06:33:28Z	YviDe

30	61	Thanks, wouldn't non-inflammatory tendinopathy also case pain?	2015-03-31 23:10:21Z	
30	61	I think I was being misleading when I mentioned overuse in the previous question I answered. I quickly looked it up, tennis elbow is actually classified as a tendinosis. Essentially, pain is simply a sense that you feel when nociceptors are activated, whether you receive a cut or punch a wall.  Inflammation is simply an autoimmune reaction that involves pain, but it's not the only thing that can cause pain.	2015-03-31 23:18:31Z	Alex Chern
26	39	Good answer, but I'd love to see more sources.	2015-04-01 20:23:56Z	Nate Barbettini

25	214	Thanks! 1) Yes sure any repetitive movements is RSI-prone but ergonomics is here to mitigate the risk: I'm looking for ergonomics advice on how to reduce the risk of RSI, and to what extent it is RSI-prone 2) Have you tried to use a foot switch to send mouse clicks all day long? My feeling was that it puts more strain on ankles than the mouse puts on hands/wrists.	2015-04-02 14:14:43Z	
25	214	In that case, I think you need to position the pedal the way we have accelerator in a car. But that's pure logical advice! :)	2015-04-03 04:44:16Z	Maulik V
23	28	Thanks, good to know. I was asking as when applying BIAFINE I recall that I had been advised to use as much as possible. I guess its composition doesn't lead to the risks you mentioned in your answer.	2015-03-31 21:02:52Z	
22	29	+1 for taking care of your voice like a singer.  Read about nodes and straining so you can learn to create relaxed clear tones.  Singers not infrequently damage their voices by the way they sing.	2017-09-15 07:23:35Z	DoctorWhom
22	426	Thanks. How comes sitting comfortably help avoid voice strain?	2015-04-08 17:12:35Z	
22	426	@FranckDernoncourt I've added additional info. In general bad posture can lead to many health problems. Probably nothing, but it's worth to try.	2015-04-08 17:20:09Z	kenorb

21	37	Yes, I know I can see the link. :-) I meant, it is helpful if the link is annotated in the question itself, with a title or other suitable material. If you don't want to interrupt the flow of text in the answer, perhaps you could put it at the bottom, like a footnote?	2015-03-31 22:10:44Z	Faheem Mitha
21	37	@FaheemMitha I'd like the references to appear at the bottom of each question, or even (though I'm not sure it's implementable by moderators) upon hovering over the link. The idea is to have references which are available if necessary but do not interrupt the flow of the text. The method I use is the standard in a number of scientific journals. It's even been implemented by Wikipedia, which points to its merit in use by typical internet users. Unfortunately, the best method (visible when hovering) might not be possible here.	2015-03-31 22:15:45Z	TheEnvironmentalist
21	37	@Tim While I certainly appreciate the effort, it's been nagging me that the meta post now seems like self-promotion. My intent was to present an improvement for the community, not to brag about my answers. My position remains the same. For that reason, as well as improvements in flow and consistency with the medical standard, I have rolled back both. I felt you had every right to know, given the time you put into both.	2015-04-16 04:05:35Z	TheEnvironmentalist
17	257	Awesome. Thanks a lot!	2015-04-03 05:56:24Z

16	327	"drinking enough fluids seems to be the most important thing for prevention" I used to think this was true, but I think it's been found to be important in preventing recurrances as opposed to new stones. Any clue if this is true?	2015-07-09 05:49:50Z	anongoodnurse

13	18	Sounds good. My only objection is that Neonatal circumcision tampers with children's bodies before there's reasonable risk of sexually transmitted diseases, I've read there's people who don't even like sex or have any interest in practicing sex, the common term used is "asexual". I know the sex related risks are not the only variables, but there are pros and cons on both choices, so maybe let grown males decide for themselves what to do with their bodies? It seems better to let individuals chose at free will what kind of risk they're willing to take.	2015-04-09 09:44:43Z	JorgeArtware
13	18	This is a really tough question, and you’re good to tackle it. Important to also note a direct rebuttal published in the same journal. An accepted answer on Skeptics (which I happen to disagree with ;-) ) also contradicts the HIV data used in the analysis cited. The literature is huge, statistically complex, and marred by all of the biases inherent to a topic that doesn’t lend itself to large randomized controlled trials. :-(	2015-04-10 23:51:39Z	Susan
13	18	Another sceptics answer that disagrees with this one (also mentioned by @PatrickHoefler) which has quite some votes. (I don't know which is right, just want to point out that there's apparently controversy despite a reputable source in this answer).	2016-12-08 12:40:43Z	Mark

13	427	You say "unclear" for some of the benefits for developed countries, and then assert categorically that the potential risks outweigh the health benefits. That seems a touch contradictory.	2015-04-13 18:39:29Z	Fomite
11	424	A quick question: does this hold true for teenaged girls and boys as well? Is supplementation not recommended if they are not getting the estimated requirement of calcium from food?	2015-04-10 09:48:00Z	anongoodnurse
11	424	@anon Hm...I was only thinking about adults. From the Amer. Academy of Pediatrics, 1999: For children and adolescents who cannot or will not consume adequate amounts of calcium from any dietary sources, the use of mineral supplements should be considered.  However, their 2014 report (link from a third party....) indicates that newer data show little to no benefit from supplements. Also summarized here.	2015-04-10 10:08:23Z	Susan

11	424	"Participants received either 1 g of elemental calcium daily as the citrate (Citracal; Mission Pharmacal, San Antonio, TX) or identical placebo." This is a huge dose, the calcium group got the entire RDA in the form of a supplement in addition to whatever they got from the diet, some of them would have ended up getting 2.5 grams of calcium per day.

5	430	No, the body cannot "break down" everything - but if the liver and kidneys are working properly, it can excrete almost anything you throw at it, given enough time.	2015-05-06 21:09:09Z	DrRandy
5	430	Your conclusion lacks any reliable sources. This is EXTREMELY dangerous because it means you're trying to build an answer from your own opinion instead of searching for one that already exists, backed by trials and empirical data. This creates the potential to SERIOUSLY MISLEAD those who read your response and conclusion. (Furthermore, you only cite wikipedia, which our community deems unreliable as a source for the answer's claim.)	2016-02-16 00:33:48Z	Dave Liu
5	430	@kenorb can you give some example of claim what body can't excrete? - Many heavy metals, including lead. Although the body may excrete some or most of it, the rest of it can become incorporated into bone tissue and therefore can't be excreted. I'm sure there are other examples.	2016-02-16 17:07:01Z	Carey Gregory

4	10	Epithelial cells die and are replaced on short cycles, but cells derived from mesothelium generally are not replaceable. This includes nerve cells, kidney cells, and a variety of other cell types. Cells from these lines are largely established by birth, or at latest, puberty.	2015-03-31 22:37:12Z	DrRandy
4	10	I like the way you explain things @DrRandy , thank you. May I suggest that you consider taking a look at this topic of meta: meta.health.stackexchange.com/questions/112/… there are some options to chose from to help you find some references to link to. For example ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . I consider it to be a very useful site to find viable sources of information to reference, so you don't need to spend too much time flipping through your books (I know that can be tedious).	2015-04-06 22:50:51Z	JorgeArtware

2	14	@Pacerier: No, these are pretty common, and unless your dentist says something about them, they are pretty harmless	2015-06-03 19:53:16Z	michaelpri
2	14	Actually you have to worry, since are a sign of possibe bruxism or occlusal trauma	2017-01-08 00:23:15Z	sergiouribe
