15473	Ok, I will study more in help center and research more about the topic. Then I'll be able to improve my question. Thanks.	2018-03-01 02:51:47Z

15454	That's probably not a problem, but this isn't a question we can answer here. The best source for medication questions is always either the manufacturer or a pharmacist. And I don't mean a cashier, clerk or pharmacy tech. I mean a registered pharmacist with "RPh" on their name tag (or the comparable title in your country).	2018-02-27 21:15:38Z	Carey Gregory
15454	Yes they will be ok, no problem.	2018-02-28 08:22:17Z	Dr. Thunder
15453	What resources do you have access to? Refrigeration, stove, oven, microwave, pots and pans, etc.	2018-02-27 17:27:21Z	WakeDemons3
15453	@WakeDemons3 Stove and pan. I'll add that to the question.	2018-02-27 17:30:06Z

15450	What are you testing with an eye chart?	2018-02-27 18:37:13Z	Graham Chiu
15450	Visual acuity. I.e. how near-sighted/far-sighted a person is. Nothing unusual, this is for an experiment, and obviously I am not an optometrist.	2018-02-27 19:37:08Z	
15450	But you're testing under darkness which isn't how we mainly use our eyes.	2018-02-27 19:47:10Z	Graham Chiu
15450	Assuming you want test results as close to what an optometrist would obtain then normal fluorescent office lighting would be the best choice.	2018-02-27 23:17:57Z	Carey Gregory
15447	This is something you need to discuss with whoever ordered the liver tests.	2018-02-27 14:45:04Z	JohnP
15447	Thats a normal LAB they recommended to check for Doctor	2018-02-28 06:49:27Z

15446	I'm looking to research this. It's not medical advice I'm seeking, it's what this is, and where I go to research further.	2018-02-27 04:27:11Z	
15446	I'm trying to figure out how I can edit your question to make it generic and not about you and your experiences, and turn it into a question about how to research this further that will be helpful to others, but I'm just not finding a way. Can you make it not about you? Please do if you can.	2018-02-27 05:19:36Z	Carey Gregory
15446	@CareyGregory I will try. I'm really tired right now, so I'll have to do it tomorrow.	2018-02-28 03:14:22Z	
15446	@SeraphsWrath - I edited your question for you a while ago after CareyGregory made a comment.  Hopefully this fits the bill for you	2018-02-28 11:40:58Z	Chris
15444	Personal medical advice is off topic here, so I edited your question to make it generic and applicable to everyone.	2018-02-27 00:56:43Z	Carey Gregory
15444	@CareyGregory Thank you, I seem to phrase a question wrongly 9/10 times on Stackexchange, so I am very glad when someone edits it before people close it down. :-)	2018-02-27 01:19:29Z

15440	As far as I'm aware, it's still unclear whether coughing is induced by the infected body to expel infectious particles, or by the pathogen to distribute itself. What ultimatley clears your illness is your immune system, and how much you cough is pretty irrelevant for your immune response to kick in.	2018-02-26 17:01:40Z	Armatus

15439	Psychology can help guide you in finding the root of it if you feel you are being excessively emotional about things.  But humans do have emotions, some express it differently than others. Excessive yawning, especially if it's a newly onset issue, can indicate physical issues as well, consider seeing a primary doctor.	2018-02-26 19:27:32Z	DoctorWhom
15432	Why don't you just eat fruit?	2018-02-26 03:40:31Z	Graham Chiu
15432	You're drinking 440 calories worth of sugar per day. I wouldn't call that nutritious.	2018-02-26 15:02:37Z	Carey Gregory

15428	Heart attacks and strokes are almost unknown amongst the Tsimané thanks to a high carbohydrate, low protein diet and active lifestyle, say researchers Tsimane men had lower CAC scores than Japanese women, a population previously regarded as having the lowest CAC scores reported for any ethnicity	2018-02-26 03:07:06Z	Count Iblis
15428	@CountIblis Thanks, I will be either editing or deleting this question but I will be bookmarking your links.	2018-02-26 09:53:55Z	
15427	Are you essentially asking what happens if you keep eating too much?	2018-02-25 21:43:18Z	Graham Chiu
15427	No, that would be "Long term health consequences of eating too much". I wonder if brain activity changes, or sleep patterns are affected. Would brain fog be long term? Would it make a person more susceptible to food comas over time? I've discovered a connection with type-2 diabetes too...	2018-02-25 23:02:08Z	
15423	Not an answer exactly, but here. I have used this treatment for malabsorption issues of fatty acids. It's definitely showed improvement. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701654	2018-02-24 21:01:33Z	cloudnyn3
15423	In a healthy person with a healthy gut, fats, in general, are completely or nearly completely absorbed. So, I do not understand why would you need to improve absorption of omega-3 fats.	2018-03-01 09:03:13Z	Jan
15422	tanning IS skin damage	2018-02-24 20:54:05Z	Kate Gregory
15422	@KateGregory yes thank you but that is not the information I’m looking for. And since I live in a tropical country it’s hardly something I can avoid entirely, so preparing my skin for situations out of my control is the best I can do.	2018-02-25 06:57:12Z	
15422	Your comment reads entirely different than your question. Rephrasing the question and adding he detail from the comment is done with an edit.	2018-02-25 12:29:36Z	LangLangC
15422	Thanks but I don’t agree, those are details unnecessary to answer the question. I’m even regretting bothering to mention them after being baited by an offtopic comment.	2018-02-25 12:31:59Z	
15422	An offtopic comment? Perhaps you would like to get something as hot as possible with as little increase in temperature as possible, or lose as much weight as possible with as little change in body mass as possible? What you are asking for is by definition impossible. If you choose not to clarify your question, it will not be answerable.	2018-02-25 13:35:53Z	Kate Gregory
15421	We can't offer medical advice here, and nobody on the internet can tell you what's wrong anyway. A lot of what you describe sounds like anxiety (panic attacks), but you need to see a doctor to find out for sure.	2018-02-23 18:11:06Z	Carey Gregory
15421	I agree with @CareyGregory. General practice doctors see patients with your symptoms every day, and you need to go see one. Go soon or your anxiety about what it could be will only get worse the longer you wait. Make an organized list of all your symptoms,  and a timeline of when they started. That doctor can help diagnose you and treat you, as well as connecting you with any additional resources you may need - cognitive therapy for example is one of our most powerful tools to combat anxiety, whether there's another illness along with it or not.  Be open to what the doctor suggests.	2018-02-24 03:12:21Z	DoctorWhom
15421	Also, to correct you @Niko, anhedonia (losing interest in doing some things you used to enjoy) is actually the equivalent of depressed mood when it comes to depression; it's a common misunderstanding that depression is just depressed mood.  Also, it's a misconception that depression and anxiety are purely mental conditions. They have very real, and sometimes overwhelming physical symptoms too.  You may have more than that going on, you need to be checked out for thyroid and stuff too to rule that out, but don't let society's misunderstanding of mental health get in the way of healing.	2018-02-24 03:15:03Z	DoctorWhom
15419	Burnout is a common complaint, but it can mean many different things to different people. It requires an individualized assessment and treatment plan. We cant do that on HealthSE, check out our guidelines.  You can start with a general practice doc who can evaluate if there are any illnesses or disorders contributing to your symptoms.  Psychology/therapy is one of the best tools for these areas as well.	2018-02-24 03:21:24Z	DoctorWhom
15418	Hi Giorgio, we have a perhaps more narrow set of rules on HealthSE than most sites. We can't help with individualized plans.  Consider seeing a personal trainer, nutritionist, fitness expert etc.	2018-02-24 03:24:44Z	DoctorWhom
15418	Hi Giorgio- this might be a better fit for fitness.SE, but it's worth reading their on topic guidelines and how to ask. :)	2018-02-24 15:46:20Z	bertieb
15417	Treated it with coconut oil in the end, seems to have worked.  Hope this helps other people - who may be in same boat as I.	2018-02-26 10:44:06Z	
15417	Strange, I thought that my question was totally within the scope of this discussion group  > "Health Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for medical specialists, students, dietitians, and anyone with health-related questions."	2018-02-26 10:55:20Z	
15416	You can only ask one question, and the first looks like seeking personal medical advice	2018-02-25 21:45:49Z	Graham Chiu
15414	Insomnia complaints are common.  You can see a doctor for an individual assessment and plan, we can't do that here.  Anyone struggling with sleep issues should read about sleep hygiene (google it) as well.	2018-02-24 03:20:11Z	DoctorWhom
15414	Welcome to Health! I have proposed an edit which removes the personal medical request, as per the site guidelines. Feel free to change this if you feel it does not fit with the question you would like to ask :)	2018-02-24 15:44:21Z	bertieb
15414	Though the San, Tsimane, and Hadza often average less than seven hours of sleep, they seem to be getting enough sleep. They seldom nap, and they don’t have trouble dozing off. The San and Tsimane languages have no word for insomnia, and when researchers tried to explain it to them, “they still don’t seem to quite understand,” Siegel says.	2018-02-26 03:10:34Z	Count Iblis
15412	Which exact medication(s) and for how long?	2018-02-23 07:43:36Z	Jan
15412	It is a good idea to ask the person who prescribed the PPI, they have access to your medical records and past test values.	2018-02-24 03:23:26Z	DoctorWhom
15412	Welcome to Health! I have proposed an edit which removes the personal medical request, as per the site guidelines. Feel free to change this if you feel it does not fit with the question you would like to ask :)	2018-02-24 15:40:10Z	bertieb
15412	@bertieb The "how long" question is a problem no matter how the question is worded. Even if it could be answered with any degree of accuracy for an individual (which I doubt), doing so would required detailed medical, lifestyle, and diet information. I don't think it can be answered at all for the general population since, obviously, diet is going to play a major role.	2018-02-25 23:07:49Z	Carey Gregory
15412	@CareyGregory aye, fair enough; that would possibly be a valuable answer (in a similar vein, a negative research finding is worthwhile!). Some might prefer closing as 'too broad', though. I'd say in its current form the question isn't making a PMA, however; but then I'm biased as I proposed the edit :)	2018-02-26 14:57:57Z	bertieb
15409	This is a good question at a fundamental level, but the reality is that there are many schools of thought on these elements of nutrition, and the answer will end up being a matter of opinion.  I know renowned physician scientists who disagree with each other on this point.  Some even suggest that any processed oil is not ideal, and all oils in our diet should come from consuming whole foods like nuts. The best answer is likely going to be that it depends on the rest of your diet.	2018-02-25 09:22:50Z	DoctorWhom
15409	Healthiest and good for you are not the same.   Many cardiologist believe you should still limit total fat.	2018-02-28 14:42:34Z	Paparazzi
15408	I'm sorry, but we can't diagnose/treat over the internet. This is something that you need to work out with your personal medical professional.	2018-02-22 14:29:17Z	JohnP
15404	I've edited your question to make it less personal. If you disagree, you can choose to roll it back, but it may then be closed for asking for personal medical advice.	2018-02-22 14:32:11Z	JohnP
15404	The question is not about an empty stomach vs with a meal. The question is "how much" food is necessary​.	2018-02-22 21:25:08Z	
15404	@JohnP I've edited the question. Is it better now?	2018-02-22 21:28:08Z	
15404	Yes, much better. I've retracted my downvote and close vote and even upvoted it.	2018-02-23 02:05:45Z	Carey Gregory
15404	@CareyGregory tx!	2018-02-23 02:06:52Z	
15403	It's not possible to answer this question without knowing family genetics, diet, medications etc.  And then it even more so becomes personal medical advice which is off topic.	2018-02-22 04:09:02Z	Graham Chiu
15401	Unfortunately, this really isn't something we can tell you. If you are concerned about being hungry after eating, please consult with a medical professional.	2018-02-21 14:40:00Z	JohnP
15399	How much does a glass of wine cost in a restaurant?	2018-02-21 16:42:50Z	Graham Chiu
15399	@GrahamChiu I don't see the duplicate - although high bills could affect blood pressure ;) Seriously, I guess your comment was for an other question?	2018-02-21 19:32:26Z	Marzipanherz
15399	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is about costs surrounding healthcare, not health itself.	2018-02-22 01:53:33Z	DoctorWhom
15399	I think it is a great question that deserves to be a topic of discussion, but SE is compartmentalized and this isn't the best place for it.	2018-02-22 01:57:50Z	DoctorWhom
15399	Healthcare costs are negligible in developed socialist counties. In capitalist economies like the USA the  cost is prohibitive. In an ultra capitalist economy like China it's bankrupting. It's politics.	2018-02-22 17:39:31Z	Graham Chiu
15398	Bran flakes and shredded wheat are products made by various companies that contain various added stuff, usually sugar. We can't assess unnamed products.	2018-02-21 05:13:19Z	Carey Gregory
15398	I've closed your question as unclear what you are asking, if it can be clarified the question can be nominated for reopening. However, your base question seems to be "Should I switch to shredded wheat over bran flakes?" which is very much a personal opinion.	2018-02-21 14:42:00Z	JohnP
15398	food is not "healthier" or not. You need to establish your criteria. If you want lower sugar in your breakfast, read the labels to see which has less sugar. If you value fibre, read the labels for fibre content. You may feel that filling you up, or tasting nice, or "lasting" until lunch so you don't want a donut at 10am all make a breakfast "healthy". On SE sites you can't ask others to make decisions or judgements for you, just ask about facts. And I can't imagine what facts you need to know about commercially available cereal that are not printed on the boxes.	2018-02-22 14:55:07Z	Kate Gregory
15398	An ingredients list alone is useful, but only to a limited extent to someone not in the life sciences.  Especially when comparing two food options that have comparable (if unequal) healthiness.  I'm hoping that someone with expertise in the area can provide an answer based on health science.  I get that even science can yield gray conclusions -- after all, it's only a method of inquiry, and health is a complex topic..  But a technical rationale, dumbed down for those of us from other walks of life, would allow us to understand and assess the reasoning and uncertainty for ourselves.	2018-02-23 01:05:22Z	
15398	@user2153235 That's all true, but what you're asking is far more complex than you think it is. It is literally impossible for anyone to answer this question with authority. In fact, any question that begins with "Which food is healthier" is unanswerable for the general population unless it's trivially obvious. The question you need to ask is "Which is healthier for me?" but that question is off topic here. The best answer would probably be, "Doesn't matter much. Eat some of everything and quit trying to micromanage your diet."	2018-02-23 02:00:15Z	Carey Gregory

15395	Inhaling smoke from any source means you're inhaling hundreds of toxins. What else needs to be known?	2018-02-21 02:44:33Z	Carey Gregory
15395	I wanted to give at least a brief answer to this because it's a common misconception. So I edited the Q to meet site guidelines and to make it a less personal question - while still answering the root of your question. You may revert if desired, but that may end in question being closed, unless you edit it to meet guidelines as above.  Cheers for caring about your brother's lungs.  Consider your own, too, second hand smoke is a real thing.	2018-02-21 04:01:07Z	DoctorWhom
15395	@DoctorWhom Nice job.	2018-02-21 05:09:28Z	Carey Gregory
15395	People don't generally inhale cigars. The smoke is drawn into the mouth to taste it, and then blown out. Completely different than cigarettes that are drawn down into the lungs. How is this not reflected in any answers?	2018-02-22 16:08:58Z	WakeDemons3

15389	Try your experiment again but only take half a breath.	2018-02-20 14:14:57Z	Graham Chiu
15389	Just a quick info: There is no chemoreceptor oxygen saturation, it’s all done via the CO2. This is why carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is so lethal: It bonds stronger to the erythrocytes than oxygen, but you won’t notice running out of oxygen because the CO2 saturation in your blood doesn’t increase.	2018-02-28 21:54:13Z	Narusan-in-coma

15376	Do you have a prepared answer?	2018-02-18 23:20:07Z	Graham Chiu
15376	Eh I might. Most of the questions I pose are ones in which I'm interested in other people's insights. If no one provides a response for a while and if I have time, I'll answer it myself though. Maybe it'll help improve peoples' lifestyles if we find some solutions.	2018-02-18 23:58:13Z	
15375	Welcome to Health, Jimmy Widdle! Please take the tour and read the help center. What has your research on this so far revealed? You may improve your question to comply with site guidelines with an edit and the help of How to Ask. Thanks!	2018-02-18 20:02:57Z	LangLangC
15375	Very broad question. I think the answer is going to depend on the goal of the massage. For example, actual physical therapy for an injury vs. relaxation and stress reduction.	2018-02-18 20:12:00Z	Carey Gregory
15375	Hi, yes, I tried to narrow it down by excluding massage specifically for injuries and illnesses.	2018-02-19 00:22:34Z	
15375	Narrowing your question would improve it. Perhaps ask about massage for a specific purpose rather than just what's the most beneficial. I don't think it's possible to say one particular type of massage is the best for everything.	2018-02-19 04:47:47Z	Carey Gregory
15382	Your question is not really on topic for fitness, so I've edited it to make it clear that you are asking about the physiology behind the heart rate/respiratory rate connection, rather than a personal health question.	2018-02-19 14:47:05Z	JohnP

15358	I'm not sure what in my question pertains to trying to get "Personalised medical advice" and I have no idea how I can improve the question. Basically what I am asking is whether a lot of physical activity would constitute a risk factor for high BP. If the answer to that question is "Personalised medical advice" then simply close the question.	2018-02-17 12:46:28Z	
15358	OK. First paragraph could be read as just that in disguise along with you worrying about your BP, giving these personal numbers. Just a precaution. – Improvement for this Q is still possible by reading How to Ask and documenting (with links) a bit of your prior research. – This does not criticise the content or goal of your question. Just a little nudge. Interesting reasoning.	2018-02-17 12:58:27Z	LangLangC
15358	You need to ask yourself why blood pressure rises with exercise, and how different that is from at rest.	2018-02-17 15:09:54Z	Graham Chiu

15342	Nobody does PCTs. It hasn't been included in CPR or ACLS training since at least the early 1990s. I've participated in dozens and dozens of resuscitations both in the field and in ERs and I've never even seen one except on TV. Doing one would get you nothing but strange looks, a stern lecture from your medical director, and remedial training.	2018-02-16 18:27:47Z	Carey Gregory

15336	Without knowing WHY someone would want to sterilize his intestine this question cannot be answered properly.	2018-02-15 07:36:00Z	Jan
15336	Sounds like an absolutely terrible idea, however. I can't think of many legitimate possible clinical applications of this, and you open the door for rampant opportunistic infections of resistant bacteria, fungus, or newly encountered pathogens without the normal happy balance of gut flora to outcompete.  Also, sterilization isn't  biologically possible 100%, there will likely be residual pockets of bacteria, and maybe some resistant strands created in the attempt.	2018-02-15 23:23:57Z	DoctorWhom

15313	I expect this varies from study to study. I was put into mine by my oncologist. I could tell you quite a lot about the process, but it might have no relevance to a study on something like ED drugs or insomnia. Also, your "either you get paid or you are desperate and would try anything" is a false dichotomy. And what makes you think people in studies aren't allowed to live a normal life including getting stressed or having a glass of wine? As my study nurse often says, "you're not in jail."	2018-02-13 01:03:48Z	Kate Gregory

15312	not necessarily: even placebo has "noticeable" side effects. every symptom you describe can also occur in a placebo group. under some circumstances, it could be an issue. if it is, then they would consider using an active placebo. this is uncommon, however. you can test for what you're describing: you ask the participants what group they were in. a properly-blinded study will have the same rate of wrong/correct belief.	2018-02-12 11:48:16Z	faustus
15311	What research have you done?	2018-02-12 09:52:49Z	Graham Chiu
15310	Diseases are often risk factors for other outcomes. HTN is one example, diabetes is another that is a risk factor for renal failure, blindness, MI, stroke, neuropathy...	2018-02-12 10:02:08Z	DoctorWhom
15310	I don't dispute that for a second (at least the risk factors part). Nor do I dispute that high blood pressure ought to be lowered. The Pickering-Platt debate from the 1950s is precisely whether hypertension is a disease entity or a risk factor. My view is that this debate is entirely irrelevant to a doctor.	2018-02-12 10:13:05Z	
15310	Yes then it is more of a philosophical discussion, because whether something is defined as a disease or not, it's the harm/potential for harm that determines its clinical significance.  It is certainly a pathological state, not just a risk for pathology; for example, harm is already occurring at a microscopic/molecular level (which in the 1950s I'm not sure to what degree they were aware of) including microtrauma to arterial intima, and dysregulation in the R/A/A axis.	2018-02-13 00:30:34Z	DoctorWhom
15304	If it is just from the sinus node, I don't think it would be. However tachycardia from atrial arrhythmia is dangerous.	2018-02-11 23:44:16Z	Caters
15304	@Caters Describing atrial tachycardias as dangerous is overly broad and misleading. Atrial fibrillation and flutter create an increased risk of stroke, which can be prevented with anticoagulants, but other than that atrial tachycardias are not dangerous. Ventricular tachycardias, on the other hand, are. Perhaps you're mixing them up?	2018-02-12 15:54:50Z	Carey Gregory
15304	It would depend entirely on the cause of the tachycardia so the question is too broad as stated. For example, there is some evidence that caffeine actually has beneficial qualities for patients with atrial fibrillation, contrary to longstanding common wisdom and medical practice.	2018-02-12 15:59:22Z	Carey Gregory
15304	@CareyGregory Seems like that could make a good answer, no? I agree the question is a bit broad but we get so many poor questions here that I think we can be a little less picky. "It depends on the source of tachycardia, for example for X __________ while for Y ___________" is a fairly parsimonious answer.	2018-02-12 16:50:56Z	Bryan Krause
15304	Atrial (sinus) tachycardia is not danger-free.  Elevated rates (especially >140) decreases diastolic filling time, thus reduces cardiac output and can lead to hypotension, ischemia, etc depending on the situation.  Stimulants including caffeine can precipitate arrythmias, depending on dose and the individual's physiology/pathophysiology. Problems in answering this question include: we don't know the underlying cause of resting HR of 110, whether there is any conductivity abnormality, the individual's dose response to the stimulant, history of ischemia or sensitivity to hypotension...	2018-02-13 00:50:14Z	DoctorWhom

We can't give medical advice on this site - and part of the reason is that it is unlikely that the device has been studied enough in the case of pregnancy to say for sure yes or no.

15157	While personal medical advice is outside the scope of Health SE, the line between personal disappointment and suicidal ideation due to a mental disorder can be very thin, which is why any case approaching this line is a far better fit for a licensed psychiatrist/psychologist/counselor than for random folks on the internet	2018-02-02 09:24:36Z	TheEnvironmentalist
15157	@DoctorWhom Maybe we misread the Q with the trigger word as a "case" (which it might be). However, I feel that this might be salvageable when reworded into really general territory of mental health. Worth a try or still off-topic then?	2018-02-02 13:02:57Z	LangLangC
15157	Suicidality, aka "suicidal ideation," can be conceptualized as a spectrum from thoughts about not existing (sometimes termed "passive suicidal ideation") to visualizing and making plans, to active attempts.  The risk for completing suicide increases when someone has a plan or previous attempt, but it still happens even with people with seemingly benign thoughts of being dead.  Many people have passive thoughts at some point in life, but I cannot in good conscious say there is any point where there is no concern someone will act on it. Depression is associated with ALL degrees of suicidality	2018-02-02 18:46:57Z	DoctorWhom
15155	yes this is a very weird question.  Actually, it's not. It's an unfortunately common question in many ways.

15138	"Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the blood pressure-lowering effects of beta-blockers than younger patients, and may therefore require lower doses.", according to academic.oup.com/eurheartjsupp/article/11/suppl_A/A21/…	2018-01-29 13:22:11Z	Nate
15138	@Nate Right, but the question is about rate, not pressure, and a reduced effect of beta blockers rather than increased.	2018-01-29 18:11:45Z	Carey Gregory
15138	@Nate You are right that the question starts with a false premise; the OP needs to put his research in his stem to show us what he's referring to.  But "The way that beta blockers lower blood pressure is through lowering the heart rate." isn't quite accurate either; they have multiple effects on decreasing overall contractility including inotropy (force) and chronotropy (rate).	2018-01-30 01:36:37Z	DoctorWhom
15138	@Nate Not entirely true. BBs also reduce contractility and some relax arteries. For example, I've seen metoprolol drop BP substantially without lowering HR at all in SVT.	2018-01-30 21:50:40Z	Carey Gregory

15116	Good question. As a cyclist who sometimes rides in cold weather, it has long perplexed me why my feet and toes get cold first despite the fact that my legs are doing so much work.	2018-01-26 02:25:05Z	Carey Gregory
15116	I couldn't find any evidence to back this up, but it could just be that there is vasodilation to the things/ calves and vasoconstriction to the feet. Since there are very few muscles in your feet themselves (the foot is controlled by muscles in the leg acting through tendons), the foot does not need much blood flow even when the legs are working hard.	2018-01-29 18:32:17Z	Nate
15114	I don't know of any non-malignant causes.	2018-01-26 07:36:20Z	Graham Chiu
15114	Yes, that is understandable. So no drug, apart from beta-HCG itself or similars molecules, can increase the levels. I wonder if environmental causes can impact the levels of the two.	2018-01-26 15:24:13Z	
15101	Why not just exchange it every few months, as recommended? Furthermore, do use toothpaste. Toothbrushes are not designed to work without it: they are much less effective! (They will still remove plaque just fine but that’s not the only reason for brushing.)	2018-01-25 10:22:57Z	Konrad Rudolph
15101	Millions of people have been doing nothing more than rinsing and allowing toothbrushes to air dry for over a hundred years. To my knowledge, no one has ever suffered harm from this.

15083	I couldn’t find a single study showing any effects of magnesium gel, and all Google hits for the phrase are from rather questionable sites. Likewise, Bowen technique is pseudoscience with no evidence of effectiveness. If I had to venture a guess I’d say that applying a gel at least has a cooling, soothing effect, compared to the oil, which likely has none whatsoever.	2018-01-23 21:46:33Z	Konrad Rudolph
15083	I should add, true psychogenic symptoms would obviously not be improved by a supplement of trace elements, even if they did help in non-psychogenic cases (but they probably really don’t): supplements aim to offset deficiency of trace elements in the normal diet, which, by definition, isn’t psychogenic: it’s purely physiological.	2018-01-23 22:05:04Z	Konrad Rudolph
15083	Magnesium oil is just magnesium chloride and water (not really an oil); it's a lot cheaper if you buy it powdered and make it yourself. The feet are supposed to absorb minerals and such best, from what I've read (followed by the hands, I think), but I'll have to find a reliable source on that; I'm not sure how well they're supposed to absorb magnesium chloride specifically, but a lot of people believe it works for magnesium sulfate with a foot soak. Magnesium chloride is supposed to be more bioavailable taken internally than magnesium sulfate.	2018-01-24 03:11:10Z	Shule

15068	I don't know enough to answer this in detail, but I know enough about photography and digital images to give it some broad brushes. The dynamic range of film x-ray is fairly narrow -- much narrower than digital x-rays. The only implications for digital storage of film images are that it could take less storage space than digital images. I would imagine that 8 bits per pixel would be sufficient to accurately encode a film x-ray since that's sufficient to encode most black and white photos. However, I wouldn't be surprised to find that they're stored the same as digital images for simplicity.	2018-01-23 19:08:17Z	Carey Gregory
15068	@CareyGregory I always wondered about increasing the dynamic range of imaging modalities.  Specifically, I wondered whether it might be possible—and at all valuable—to combine various CT windows to create a high dynamic range composite that optimised multi-organ visualisation in a single image. It would necessitate mapping multiple densities to a shared grey-level, but application of Graph Theory could ensure these don’t exist adjacent.	2018-02-06 22:26:16Z	CJK

15061	"mercury toxicity" is very variable. Eg. elemental mercury is pretty much inconsequential if ingested once. Even injecting mercury does little except mechanical blockage. Only repeated exposure allows elemental mercury to accumulate into toxic levels. On the other hand, a drop of dimethylmercury on hand wearing a latex glove is pretty much death sentence, that's how Karen Wetterhahn died. So, "contains mercury" alone says nothing, it's "what kind and how much" that matters. Just as pretty much everything, eg magnesium oxide vs magnesium citrate.	2018-01-25 12:07:28Z	Agent_L

15060	@CareyGregory Thank you for your comment! (I am unsure how I used food as a medication with profit potential?) I believed there had to be some studies since virtually everyone in Japan consumes foods with high iodine content. Hence I believed that there sure was a way how to establish safety measures (use this amount of kombu and boil for this long, eat 400 ml max a day). Maybe I was mistaken?	2018-01-22 23:08:19Z	
15060	I'm sure iodine levels have been studied in Japan, but I doubt it's been studied in the way you're looking for. I could be wrong, of course, but it's very hard to quantify the things you're looking for, so such a study would be very difficult. Who would fund it?	2018-01-22 23:26:04Z	Carey Gregory
15060	Sure, hence you'd say there is no way of telling how much iodine can one consume from typical Japanese foods a day?	2018-01-23 11:15:21Z

14971	Your question fascinates me because I was in a sad quandry over the blood types of my parents' in relation to my own. I knew my mother's blood type and my own to be "true". I had my (still living at 100 yrs old) father's military dog tags from World War Two. Dog tags are engraved with the sailor's blood type. The blood type on the tag revealed that he could not be my biological father. This gave me so much misery for the past several years and I felt compelled to hold the "secret" from everyone I knew.

I think your question is a ultimately a request for medical advice, but if I were going to answer it I'd say delete about 80% of what you have.

14967	@CareyGregory I was NOT asking for medical advice. I was asking for clearest way to communicate issues with Doctor. As a courtesy I posted "moderators feel free to modify"	2018-01-14 12:14:24Z	
14967	@LangLangC ok, I will clean up text, use orderly fonts (will type instead of hand-write), and text in bold for current problems. Of course I was concerned about overwhelming Doctor with too much info. Yes, you are right, these visuals help me understand my Dad's conditions.	2018-01-14 12:19:26Z

14967	A table is a good idea. But include EVERY medication and herbal supplement and cream and powder and EVERY type of treatment that he takes - everything he takes/uses is important to know, even if not prescribed. @LangLangC I'd be careful of how that advice was phrased, as well as regarding Senna. Senna as a stimulant has a medical use for motility problems, but can have toxicity long term especially if someone uses it for constipation that isn't a motility problem.  When you make the table, list by name. Include amount, what times of day he takes it, and when he started / who prescribed it.	2018-01-14 20:59:14Z	DoctorWhom

14961	Low sodium diets have benefits but I'd ask your doctor before going too far below the recommended low-sodium restriction, since in some people an ultra low sodium diet can lead to hyponatremia, and you may want to ensure that you don't have a condition/medication that can predispose you to that.  You can look up natural sodium content of foods and add it together to know what your daily intake actually is.	2018-01-15 20:23:20Z	DoctorWhom

14910	I have really bad apnoea and also fit your profile. Essentially the tongue is rolling back into your throat and causing the snoring. Sleeping in the lateral position should help, as would sleeping propped up. I found a great medical device that will not stop vibrating until I am lying on my side. Now, given that you're travelling this is no use to you. I would suggest that the anti-snoring positions do work or at least reduce the snoring, but you're re-positioning yourself in the middle of the night.	2018-02-13 05:23:57Z	faustus

14892	As it stands, an answer to this question would have to address the many 'heart' cases and deficiencies a lay person is unlikely to (theoretically) overcome: diagnosis and treatment. Lacking expertise increases actions in the wrong direction, lacking tools, like meds and equipment, amplify (or dampen?) this problem. The "stock" part is therefore misleading. (But needed and applicable emergency meds are sometimes prescribed) What to look for, how to mentally or procedurally prepare for events might be much more answerable here. That's still broad and might yield several separate questions…	2018-01-08 12:24:05Z	LangLangC

14859	I think the point of confusion here is simply the word "crystallin." Crystallin isn't a muscle; it's a protein that creates the clear structure of your eye's lens and cornea.

14859	Thank you @CareyGregory, indeed that's clearer (no joke about that). I found a similar topic on Reddit with -some parts- of answer. Actually many people can contract manually their eye's lens. I found a comment a interesting : "I think the eye focus [...] is just learning how to control a muscle that people dont usually use. Its like when people can move their ears or flex one pectoral at a time." I agree that this muscle can be controlled by everyone but not everyone does it, like moving your ear. However I'm still looking forward for a more detailed answer to my question.	2018-01-05 08:20:27Z

14714	From a practical standpoint, I'd just ignore it.  Since weight loss is a long-term process, a single day with an error isn't a problem.  From a theoretical standpoint, however, this is a very interesting question -- how many calories do you lose during a blood donation?	2017-12-19 22:54:08Z	Mark
14714	@Mark And further, how many extra calories do I burn regenerating the lost blood? Not that I'd want to rely on that for any progress, of course.	2017-12-19 22:55:01Z

14689	Please bear in mind that personalised medical advice (the 'another question'?) is off-topic here. Interpersonal Skills SE might also be a better fit for certain aspects of this answer. As is, this question has a lot of personal detail already. But I guess I see your point/twist here. – The most important second opinion will come from another doctor.	2017-12-15 08:39:25Z	LangLangC
14689	@LangLangC -- Thanks for the response -- I understand personalized medical advice is not possible, for so many reasons!  As opposed to medical advice, I am curious about what others might think the "right questions" would be.  Are you sure Interpersonal would be the correct forum for questions like this?  I have rephrased the last part of my question.	2017-12-15 09:58:54Z	
14689	@ashleedawg - The base thing your friend needs to do is go to a doctor. Bloody stool is not something you want to just ignore or poke around on the internet for answers. Interpersonal wouldn't be a fit for the medical stuff, that would have to be left out, but if you wanted advice on how to get your friend to talk about it again, that might be on topic there depending on how you worded it.	2017-12-15 14:16:30Z	JohnP
14689	I'm not being clear on my question, sorry -- my concern is that I feel that my friend needs a second opinion rather than submitting to serious surgery.  Perhaps I'm distrusting of doctors making such major decisions based on a few-minute appointment.  For example, the changes in diet that the doctor is convinced will alleviate symptoms have not worked, thus (from what I understand) he is basing the treatment on a misdiagnosis.  I guess what I'm asking is for advice on how to "insist" on a 2nd opinion, when even getting the 1st opinion required "jumping through hoops".	2017-12-15 17:25:54Z

14518	A complete medical history, signs, symptoms and chief complaint, observation of the patient, results of additional tests such as echocardiogram, stress test, angiogram... the list is potentially long and different for each patient.

14498	Absence of spontaneous respirations is a reliable sign that either there isn't a heartbeat or there soon won't be so the layperson CPR guidelines call for starting compressions based on that alone. Professional CPR guidelines call for verifying a pulse first. (I'm referring to US guidelines.)	2017-11-29 15:25:17Z	Carey Gregory
14498	@CareyGregory It might interest you that in the EU, guidelines even for professional are not to check for pulse. If the patient is unconscious, step one is to check breathing, step two is to secure airways with the LTD or intubation (depending on skill of professional) if there is no regular breathing, step 3 is to connect the AED, and by then you will know if there’s a regular pulse or not. Meanwhile, the second person will be performing thorax compressions from the call „No vital signs, start resuscitation“ (right after step one).	2017-11-29 15:55:43Z	Narusan-in-coma
14498	@Narusan-sedated Although it would be relatively unusual, where that guideline goes wrong is the respiratory arrest that hasn't progressed to cardiac arrest yet. Why break ribs when a bag valve mask will suffice? I get the reasoning behind layperson CPR guidelines skipping the pulse check since that's a more difficult skill, but professionals should be able to confirm a pulse in 10 seconds or less.	2017-11-30 02:28:58Z	Carey Gregory
14498	@Narusan-sedated I seem to have forgotten my password to my account so i cant get back in it and put the check mark beside you answer. Sorry :c	2017-11-30 04:48:16Z	Someone
14498	@CareyGregory I think they’ve made the experience that even professionals can’t reliably feel pulse. Depending on the scenario, that can get quite tricky or close to impossible. With a progressing respiratory arrest, the pulse will get pretty weak. Add to that a scene with multiple injured or a cramped up location, and I can see the benefits of this guideline. // Also, I thought that breaking rips during CPR was somewhat a myth (as in that’s not the case every second resuscitation). As I said, that’s a matter of <15s until the AED is connected and one knows whether there’s pulse.	2017-11-30 05:45:16Z	Narusan-in-coma

Some of the standard recommendations were helpful for him (see e.g. mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/diagnosis-treatment/…), like elevating the head of the bed, eating slower, avoiding eating during the two or three hours before going to bed, avoiding tomato sauce, fats, alcohol, garlic, onion and caffeine, losing weight (which it doesn't sound like you need to do), and eating smaller amounts, more often, instead of three square meals.  He took an antacid as well but it wasn't as helpful as the...	2017-11-27 13:35:31Z	aparente001

He also got a prescription for a mild anxiolytic and learned to take a small dose when he started feeling very anxious.  The thing that helped more than anything was to change jobs.  Being in a healthier environment reduced the anxiety. But that is all anecdotal.  Each case of GERD is unique.  Please give your doctor a chance to help you, by working with him or her on this.	2017-11-27 13:38:39Z	aparente001
14478	I'm not sure if reflux that is so severe that results in esophageal ulcers and asthma can be controlled by diet alone. Such reflux can be from hiatus hernia or other condition that results in an excessive relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. You need to discuss with a doctor about investigations that would reveal the exact cause of the reflux. Then...you can start to discuss about treatment. I do not think that improving posture alone would help.	2017-11-28 08:14:25Z	Jan

14476	Adding on @CareyGregory 's comment: We do have a guideline on how to research such questions and require at least a certain bit of research: health.stackexchange.com/q/13712/8212	2017-11-26 16:23:26Z	Narusan-in-coma
14474	Just want to check, does anyone think if this would be better asked on research or biology stackexchange?	2017-11-26 11:45:16Z	
14474	In my opinion, it’s fine, but due to low activity on the site, you might not get an answer.	2017-11-26 12:33:39Z	Narusan-in-coma
14474	Nice question, although you'll need indeed patience for an answer. If you want to ask about it elsewhere then make sure to vary the focus sufficiently to avoid a frowned upon cross-post.	2017-11-26 15:22:27Z	LangLangC
14474	Exactly why I asked this question: meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303690/…	2017-11-26 15:39:09Z	
14474	Sadly it was originally worded in such a way as to be a duplicate and of course once downvoting starts, it seems to be a one way street.	2017-11-26 15:39:31Z	
14472	We are looking for simplicity. This is currently too broad. What is "modern toothpaste"? Please update your question to either include links to specific "formulas"/ingredients, or link to one or two sites that are included in the group "all around www".	2017-11-26 13:27:40Z	LangLangC
14472	Would you mind focusing on one of the ingredients? Otherwise that blows all proportions	2017-11-27 12:28:58Z	Narusan-in-coma
14472	I can't, because i can't say, ok, this one is more toxic then other, and then choose it.	2017-11-27 21:43:47Z	
14472	All around the www they say the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, big corporations are hiding the cure for cancer, and Obama was born in Kenya. You might want to be more selective about what you read. Critical thinking skills are important.	2017-11-29 02:08:41Z	Carey Gregory
14472	+1 to @CareyGregory . Well said!	2017-11-30 18:12:07Z	Taylor
14468	Smoking is never really healthy. Especially the anti cancer property is bonkers. a) Cancer is a random mutation of genes, and while that process isn’t yet fully comprehended I can assure you ingested molecules have nothing to do with it unless they promote building of free radicals and other cancerous molecules. b) Smoking of any kind will make you inhale carbonmonoxide, which isn’t great for your lungs. So, the answer would be no, because ashwagandha doesn’t have these properties at all. // It would be great if you could link to the resources that claim this, maybe their line of reasoning is	2017-11-25 09:34:07Z	Narusan-in-coma
14468	[cont‘d] a little off but there’s still truth to some claims. We can only verify that if you show us the source though...	2017-11-25 09:34:40Z	Narusan-in-coma
14468	Also, take a look at this guide on how to evaluate health effects of products	2017-11-25 12:41:15Z	Narusan-in-coma

14424	By precision I was meaning the decimal precision, but if wiki says 7.32-7.42 so it's a precision of +-0.1.  Yes I am talking about the homeostasis, how does the blood corrects itself after ingesting some food for example, I was wondering if we could see on a graph the real time correction occurring of the ph after getting disrupted, like is it happening linearly ?, etc...	2017-11-21 22:46:15Z	
14421	I'm reasonably sure that it turned out simply to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

14411	Welcome to HealthSE! Nice question! You're invited to take the tour and read the help.	2017-11-20 17:09:05Z	LangLangC
14411	Just as comment due to limited time: Is routine pregnancy test necessary in women of reproductive age admitted to the emergency department?	2017-11-20 17:13:54Z	bummi
14411	Yay, I found something: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26334607	2017-11-20 20:52:37Z	
14411	" 1. Every female of reproductive age with significant injuries should be considered pregnant until proven otherwise by a definitive pregnancy test or ultrasound scan. "	2017-11-20 20:53:10Z	
14411	@Stacey Feel free to answer the question yourself. From my understanding, danger of child loss is not high when the foetus is still very small, and when it’s larger, pregnancy is easily indicated by the typical belly shape (although that’s not a rock solid indicator). I would add a notice to the armband just to be sure (and not writing down the current week, but week 1 or expected delivery) but do no more than that.	2017-11-20 21:14:12Z	Narusan-in-coma
14410	Welcome to HealthSE! Please take the tour  and read the help. Please edit your question to remove the personalised info in order to comply with site guidelines and try to make clear what you mean with pain response when there is no feeling of pain.	2017-11-20 16:47:27Z	LangLangC
14410	I edited it, I thought that it would help, that's why I added it in the first place. Thanks! I'm going through the tour and help pages now.	2017-11-20 19:07:11Z	
14410	Thx for the edit. But: Hm, I'm still struggling to comprehend. Do you mean something like autonomous reflex, like touching something hot and retracting your finger immediately before you consciously realised it was hot? Or is that touching a hot plate, voluntarily lifting the finger and caring for it (you know it will be bad) although there is no pain felt at all?	2017-11-20 20:40:46Z	LangLangC
14410	It's like the first example you gave, an autonomous reflex. When I injure myself I always end up nursing it the moment right after I hurt it. It takes tremendous willpower or diverted focus to not do that right away.The strange part is the reflex when I can't feel that there is pain.	2017-11-20 21:34:50Z	
14410	I edited your question to make it not such an obvious request for personal medical advice, but it's still completely unclear what you're asking so I voted to close on that basis. If you can clarify what you're asking, I'll retract.	2017-11-21 05:30:05Z	Carey Gregory

14409	Edited the question	2017-11-21 01:47:51Z	
14409	Dandruff is flaking of your scalp. It can happen for lots of reasons and a common misconception is that it's due to improper washing or hygiene issues. That's not necessarily true, it can depend on a number of factors including how often you wash your hair or if you use a lot of hair product. I've had it before as a 12 year old and my dermatologist informed me it was due to washing my hair too much and wearing a hat all the time.	2017-11-24 00:09:24Z	Master Yoda
14409	@MasterYoda this should be an answer +1 thanks	2017-11-24 02:03:35Z	
14406	Why no answer? I just need a simple and short answer. You don't have to explain in details as I'm not a doctor and I'll not understand the medical terms and the complicated answers.	2017-11-20 20:49:53Z	
14395	Since we do not know how much hair disappeared: possible that a few grey hairs where concerning when visible and those few now just fell out for good?	2017-11-19 23:00:00Z	LangLangC
14395	Dont think this qualifies as age reversal. You were under stress, your body responded. Now, since those triggers and are not there, your body is no reacting.	2017-11-20 05:05:59Z	larry909

14390	Welcome to Health.SE! I've significantly edited your question and formatted it because you had explicitly asked for it.

If you are curious about the other aspects of your question, feel free to ask another question on this site. If you happen to disagree with my edit, feel free to revert my edit or edit the question yourself.	2017-11-18 12:21:21Z	Narusan-in-coma
14390	Thanks for welcoming and editing. You are right my mistake.	2017-11-18 12:30:10Z	
14390	But still, made some changes on your edit, hopping it is not bad practice?	2017-11-18 12:36:14Z

14390	While I'll let someone with a background specifically in teeth answer this more completely, one of the biggest problems with this toothpaste would be the lack of fluoride. The fluoride in your toothpaste isn't there for fun, it serves a serious medical need in modifying the natural hydroxyapatite composing your teeth, which is very susceptible to tooth decay from a modern diet, into fluorapatite, which is highly resistant to decay. While there are groups here and there that try to avoid fluoride out of concern of overdose, losing your teeth is much worse than most possible fluoride effects.	2017-11-19 22:05:13Z	TheEnvironmentalist
14379	You will not die from this regime in a very short amount of time because it will likely hit a a few of the most essential nutrients, but not all of them, since we still do not know them all. That is the health side. My guess is that you will want to die for a little bit of variation in your meals. A vaired diet is currently the best guideline available.	2017-11-17 18:08:26Z	LangLangC
14363	Nobody can tell you why it didn’t work. That’s not really an easy thing to prove, and there’s no data.

14360	I think this question would be more appropriate in the cooking exchange and would get better answers there.	2017-11-15 18:00:51Z	Carey Gregory
14360	The cooking exchange is "for professional and amateur cooks and chefs," while the health exchange is "for medical specialists, students, dietitians, and anyone with health-related questions." Why would a chef be more knowledgeable about micronutrient loss than a dietitian?	2017-11-15 20:45:25Z	
14360	Because we don’t have dietitians on the site an we don’t deal with the chemical reactions fold undergoes while cooking. This is basically what @CareyGregory said. This Q would be on topic if you ask as what chemical X does to one‘s body.	2017-11-15 22:36:38Z	Narusan-in-coma
14360	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question is asking about the chemical decomposition and alteration of nutrients during a special cooking technique, which is not directly related to Health.SE and does not meat the scope.	2017-11-15 22:37:28Z	Narusan-in-coma

14355	@LyndonWhite - energy exists, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a "chemical". Some forms of it come from chemical reactions, but some don't. And a lonely photon flying through the universe isn't really a chemical in my view.	2017-11-16 10:10:10Z	Davor

14337	It's great you've planned it out!  How long is your appointment?  I recommend you actually print this list out, tell the doctor/RD you have made a list of your questions, and give it to them so they can decide how to prioritize the most important topics to make sure are hit at this visit.	2017-11-14 08:19:52Z	DoctorWhom
14337	This is my first visit, and I believe it is for 1 hour. Is there something else I'm missing to ask? I can't think of any and I want to make best use of the time I am paying for.	2017-11-14 08:50:37Z	
14337	Very wise to have all your questions ready before your appointment.  You have similar questions to these but these are some areas I feel are important.  I'd ask for strategies to avoid having to weigh your food or count calories -- as it’s not very practical or sustainable.  Also, what they recommend regarding B12 supplementation (ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer) -- as the supplement industry is essentially unregulated if they have a brand they’d recommend.	2017-11-14 10:15:14Z	Mike-DHSc
14337	Thanks for that, @Mike-DHSc. I'd add to that list of questions. I agree weighing food is not sustainable. It's way too much of a hassle. Being the old-school guy I am, I write it down in a book and update the App at the end of the day before sleeping as of now.	2017-11-14 10:19:02Z	
14337	@larry909, I think the problem with some of the questions is the following: the website one maybe reading will not have detailed knowledge of the patients history, diet habits, what's actually going wrong, etc. I wanted a personal opinion of someone who was knowledgable in this area. Unfortunately, human body ain't nothing like Computer Science where you have (only) one correct answer for a deterministic problem. We, as humans, are very non-deterministic.	2017-11-16 11:15:40Z

14307	Six hours and 20 minutes per day of commuting, which means sitting. Sure, you can walk about on a train, but not much, really. I hope that job is a physically active one otherwise you're going to be sitting 14+ hours per day, which has demonstrated negative health consequences. I predict you're going to look forward to that train ride a lot less than you think after a few weeks.	2017-11-13 00:07:36Z	Carey Gregory
14307	@CareyGregory yeah that is what I am afraid of. The job is a Data science job. There is a treadmill desk at the office but...	2017-11-13 00:12:39Z	
14306	What do you mean by broken bone? I have had broken foot, ankle and arm. In none of these cases it was obvious to me or the bystanders. Twice I got my plaster after 2-3 days when visited doctor because the pain didn't lessen. But the ankle fracture was only discovered 2 weeks later when I visited doctor because the foot was badly burnt in sun after trying to soothe the pain with ketoprofem gel.	2017-11-12 23:22:47Z	Džuris
14306	@Džuris You’re experience is rather unlikely. Most (complete) fractures come with pain and swelling of the area where the fracture is. I think it is safe to assume from the question context that this is talking about apparent fractures, if no one recognises the fracture there‘s no one worrying about first aid. The ankle fracture could have been discovered earlier (you yourself noted the pain).	2017-11-12 23:40:38Z	Narusan-in-coma
14306	NOT urgent care.	2017-11-12 23:59:13Z	Carey Gregory
14306	People with broken collarbones classically drive themselves to a doctor. Fingers and toes the same, in fact toes are rarely treated. Ribs even. But arms or legs are different. Not sure you can say "a bone".	2017-11-13 16:48:02Z	Kate Gregory
14306	@schizoid04 I'm not saying urgent care centers are to be avoided. I just think that suspected fractures deserve a higher level of care.	2017-11-14 05:26:25Z	Carey Gregory
14305	This is absolute garbage! How could anything taken into one's digestive system cleanse the lungs? In order to do so, it would somehow have to transport the toxins into the bloodstream where they could be removed by the kidneys and liver.	2017-11-12 22:41:29Z	BillDOe

14286	Welcome to HealthSE! You are invited to take the tour. Please also read the help and especially the section about asking here. If you edit your question to include definitions for your abbreviations and perhaps a bit on your prior research you will improve the quality of your question and increase the chances of getting a good answer.	2017-11-10 15:26:41Z	LangLangC
14282	In general, that is an excellent question. But currently I fear that this is also a problem. A bit too broad. I currently read that as: please condense several books and semesters on methodology for several fields of medicine and psychology into a one page answer. And I certainly could try to tackle that. I once was speed reading War & Peace in less than one hour and kept a perfect memory of its contents: it's about Russia. -> Please increase the specificity of this question ;)	2017-11-10 14:07:33Z	LangLangC
14282	Why is there a restriction on comment length :(. I'll put this into my original question. Edit: Done, see at the bottom of my question.	2017-11-10 14:50:08Z	
14282	Hopefully this narrows it down a bit.	2017-11-10 15:04:04Z	
14279	Are you sure the doctors said you shouldn't exercise in gym at all? Or that only swimming would help with the problem not gym?	2017-11-13 01:30:56Z	Džuris
14279	You need to ask them why, since they're the ones who said it.  We can't diagnose you. Also, in what way could it matter if the doctors were women?	2017-11-13 06:15:48Z	DoctorWhom
14279	@Džuris yes they said that I can't at all	2017-11-13 08:04:56Z	
14279	@DoctorWhom as arguments the women said that gym is a sweaty place and swimming is not..	2017-11-13 08:05:28Z	
14279	@DoctorWhom unfourtunately, it's quite possible that the doctors are not that much into gym. Some 12 years ago my scoliosis was discovered and I asked the doctor if I can go to gym. He said "no, you may not lift weights". I assumed that he imagines "gym" to mean "olympic weightlifting" or similar and visited a sports doctor who told me basically the same as in the answer by D Bagnall.	2017-11-13 16:42:25Z	Džuris
14277	Oh, trust me, this isn't a problem unique to Germany.	2017-11-10 02:44:00Z	Carey Gregory
14277	Given that you acknowledge there's probably no summary data, this is either primarily opinion based (and you do seem to solicit just that), or too broad; do you expect someone to conduct a survey of countries here?	2017-12-02 19:49:13Z	Fizz

14273	Our body wasn’t developed for the abundance of food in nowadays society. Hunger is mostly measured as “how full the stomach is”, boldly ignoring (most) energy stored in fats. [That’s partly regulated by signals connected to glucose levels in the blood]. This Wikipedia article is a good starting point. Furthermore, Hunger also depends on psychological factors.	2017-11-09 15:57:55Z	Narusan-in-coma
14273	There are incorrect assumptions. People don't eat just because of hunger.	2017-11-09 18:26:41Z	Graham Chiu
14273	This is actually a good question deserving a good answer.	2017-11-10 03:09:14Z	Carey Gregory
14267	Have you tried taking Metformin with food?	2017-11-09 05:10:21Z	Graham Chiu
14267	Actually yes I have.	2017-11-09 11:28:34Z	
14267	You definitely shouldn't stop your medication on your own and sever heartburn is also not something you should try to solve yourself. You need to try and talk to your doctor - either your GP or the one who prescribed metformine (endocrinologist perhaps). This is not the type of thing that can be resolved over the internet (that's why personal medical advice is strictly off-topic here).	2017-11-09 21:27:08Z	Lucky
14267	I’m more concerned about the heartburn actually @Lucky	2017-11-09 23:45:48Z	
14267	@AbrahamRay Try resveratrol too, it might improve your diabetes and you might be able to lower the metformin dose. I think you should visit your doctor because the heartburn. Probably some antacids would help.	2017-11-10 01:52:39Z	inf3rno
14262	While your tongue is a strong muscle, there’s no way that works. Most braces have to be worn 24/7 for good reasons, and I doubt anyone could push the teeth for longer than 30 minutes/day. We’re all lacking concentration, endurance and time to do that.	2017-11-08 12:19:35Z	Narusan-in-coma
14262	@Narusan-sedated so it is myth ? suppose if we do that also, it will not make weaken our teeth ?	2017-11-08 12:21:22Z	
14262	As braces don’t weaken the teeth significantly, the tongue won’t either. But yes, this is a myth.	2017-11-08 12:22:12Z	Narusan-in-coma
14262	@Narusan-sedated you can post it as an answer, if i dont get any better reply, i will accept yours......	2017-11-08 12:22:54Z	
14260	Welcome to HealthSE. Please take the tour and read the help. If you edit your question it might be easier for us to know what you are asking, exactly. Share your prior research and explain how you arrive at those numbers.	2017-11-08 09:34:04Z	LangLangC
14260	The number was conducted by a small, some sort of health care center body fat machine in my gym, was given by a PT who was trying to get me into his program. Now I wonder the legitimacy of it.	2017-11-08 09:48:40Z	
14260	Tks for quick responds, I might check it again somewhere else	2017-11-08 09:56:55Z	
14253	Usually this is due to sleeping position. Try not to cut off veins when sleeping. Apart from that, visit a general practitioner  of your choice if the issues keeps occurring.	2017-11-07 16:59:06Z	Narusan-in-coma
14253	@Narusan-sedated I actually know that very well. Funny thing is that I wake up with my head on my arm. But that is not my intended sleeping posture and I have no control over it.	2017-11-07 17:01:02Z	
14253	Well, invent measure of changing that. Try sleeping on your back/side (different to what you do now). It’s not something serious unless it prevents you from having a good sleep.	2017-11-07 17:03:15Z	Narusan-in-coma
14253	@Narusan-sedated alright. Trying it right now.	2017-11-07 17:04:32Z	
14253	Welcome to health SE :-). We can't offer personal medical advice over the internet, but usually any persisting condition is worth a visit to the doctor's.	2018-01-14 22:24:17Z	Lucky
14242	I would tend to disagree that this would be more suited to Physics SE. In particular, the question is: "Are there any known harmful/dangerous bacteria that would cause this behavior?" which definitely is on-topic.	2017-11-06 20:57:31Z	
14242	Well, the answer to it is no, because the negative pressure is not due to bacteria but standardised sealing processes (the sterilisation of the food is usually achieved with vacuum sealing of the can). Hence the negative pressure. Any questions regarding the negative pressure are better suited for Physics.SE. This is what I meant.	2017-11-06 21:02:12Z	Narusan-in-coma
14242	Thanks. Go ahead and that as an answer, I will upvote and accept it.	2017-11-06 21:03:26Z	
14242	Deleted my off-topic comment by the way, my answer is - at least in my understanding of the site’s scope - perfectly on-topic. I thought you’d want to inquire sealing and sterilisation techniques and why there was a negative pressure exactly, which would not be best suited here. As it is, the question is perfectly fine.	2017-11-06 21:24:12Z	Narusan-in-coma
14241	I altered your question to meet site standards. Revert if you disagree but it will likely be closed for personal advice request. For your case, I presume the same doctor prescribed both, right?  They likely know what they're doing. Ask them or your pharmacist. Steroids reduce inflammation and protect your tissues from damage from inflammation. They do suppress your immune system, from a little to a lot, which can allow viruses to grow (or reactivate) - but you're treating the virus with an antiviral also.	2017-11-08 06:33:49Z	DoctorWhom
14237	I doubt that coughing will make your cough worse and if you don't cough you will get a tickling sensation in your throat that will force you to cough.	2017-11-06 20:46:55Z	Caters
14237	Someone told me not to dry cough because it gets worse, so curious how true that might be.	2017-11-13 18:45:45Z	
14237	The only real concern is pleurisy. The most important question is whether or not the cough is productive, but I'm not interested and answering a question like this unless it's substantiated through research. Not enough effort has been shown that an attempt was made answer the question yourself.	2017-11-13 22:19:26Z	Atl LED
14236	You should visit a psychologist. Please read through these two posts: Effects of Masturbation on Health and How many times a week is masturbation good for health	2017-11-06 16:34:02Z	Narusan-in-coma
14236	@Narusan-sedated I'm searching for drug or something,  i edited my question, please take a look.	2017-11-06 17:31:02Z	
14236	As Narusan pointed out, having that desire/habit is a sign of health. Suppressing this desire is very likely not healthy. If this is motivated by religion or some belief like that: Provided you find a therapy for this 'elsewhere', you might have to edit this question into asking for anaphrodisiacs (that are not completely deleterious.) As is, your Q is about a discipline of mind and you want to cheat by cutting out the discipline part by numbing your mind.	2017-11-06 18:10:12Z	LangLangC

14229	So basically, whether or not I take vitamin K while pregnant, the baby will still be more prone to bleeding if I take phenobarbital to prevent seizures and thus the routine neonatal vitamin K shot would be even more important. So I can't prevent the deficiency but it won't be much of a problem anyway.	2017-11-06 07:24:44Z	
14207	The advice is for legs in a dependent position when venous return is impeded. You don't need dvt prophylaxis when recumbent unless you're immobile eg post surgery	2017-11-03 19:53:24Z	Graham Chiu
14207	so if you're in an economy seat, are you recumbent or are your legs in a dependent position? How would you know?	2017-11-03 21:31:21Z	
14207	No coach seat I've been in for the last 25 years allowed anything resembling recumbent.	2017-11-03 22:08:47Z	Carey Gregory

14203	Yes, there are, but a pressure of 60/40 usually indicates a severely ill individual who needs immediate medical attention, quit possibly in an ICU. Could you clarify what you're asking?	2017-11-03 02:14:54Z	Carey Gregory
14203	fludrocortisone comes to mind.	2017-11-03 07:56:37Z	Graham Chiu
14203	The medical industry is unable to help ; See a cardiologist  regularly ( 3 days  ago). Typical BP , 6 AM =  189/ 110 then 7 AM= 73/43  ( today) , and low for the rest of the day. I am sure an ICU would screw me up worse.	2017-11-03 14:18:38Z	
14203	Sounds like an autonomic problem. See neurologist.	2017-11-03 19:56:46Z	Graham Chiu

14197	A web search on homeostatic sleep pressure yields many results.	2017-11-04 15:44:26Z	Carey Gregory
14195	Goals here? Ultra deep inhaling and holding pyrolised or vaporised fumes is 'good' only for economic reasons / when illegal stuff is hard to come by. The deeper you inhale toxins and soot the harder time your body has to clear them out of your lungs again. Please reread your sources: the first says Inhaling fumes from burning stuff is bad in general and then says what I've just written. The second tries to minimise harm by giving advice when smoking. THC and CBD are so similar I doubt they are much different in absorption speed.	2017-11-03 18:33:21Z	LangLangC
14195	Thanks, you are right. But, vaping still has 5% as much toxins as smoking, right? So what is the best technique for vaping, to avoid toxins in lungs and still get high? Is it the short shallow puffs or the quick deep breath?	2017-11-06 23:10:41Z	
14194	Are we speaking of chocolate or marihuana? I don’t understand that type of slang...	2017-11-02 15:16:06Z	Narusan-in-coma
14194	@Narusan-sedated Both. "Edibles" are edible items (typically chocolate candies) infused with marijuana derivatives.	2017-11-03 02:10:20Z	Carey Gregory
14194	Although your question isn't off topic, I think you'll find more expertise on this question in marijuana forums. Western medicine mostly knows next to nothing about marijuana because it's been prohibited from research for decades.	2017-11-03 02:13:04Z	Carey Gregory
14194	When eating the effects just are to some effect more unpredictable. Before reaching the brain it passes through the liver, alcohol interferes with the liver process and the brain effects. Even the exact same dose might give different results each time. Most importantly: aside from set and setting, your dosage stated seems very inaccurate. And if 'no other edibles' excludes normal foods then any timing bets are off anyway. If you edit you Q to include such info there might be even more to add.	2017-11-03 18:05:00Z	LangLangC
14194	I did eat normal food in between, but based on other users' reactions I don't think this should affect it that much. I also drank alcohol throughout, so maybe my liver was too busy processing the alcohol. I do remember a nugget of wisdom from my health class that the liver processes alcohol before everything else, so maybe the constant intake of alcohol prevented it from metabolizing the marijuana until much much later.	2017-11-06 23:18:27Z	
14189	quora.com/…	2017-11-01 18:38:30Z	Carey Gregory
14189	@CareyGregory Just to be clear, does this first (most popular) answer imply that it's strictly a bit of a temporal parlor trick; that it's merely the cone fatigue of me closing my eye and then switching to it? Because that wouldn't explain the consistent alternation, i.e. both eyes should be able to show the same variation, but they don't. The second answer on that page is more in line with what is happening and what I personal theorized.	2017-11-01 19:02:22Z	
14189	I think the second answer by Martin Oguzie is probably correct.	2017-11-01 23:02:43Z	Carey Gregory

14187	Your body doesn't produce them exactly. They're simply partially dried mucus mixed with particles you inhaled.	2017-11-01 18:40:41Z	Carey Gregory
14187	While right in principle, not so sure about Carey's complete reasoning. The body doesn't produce them. They are formed. Dried mucus/bogey might pick up less dirt, dried bogey might restrict airflow/amount of further dirt inhaled, etc… But I fear this is an IgNoble prize in the waiting.	2017-11-01 20:45:50Z	LangLangC
14183	Health risk to whom? If you're a healthy, active, and mentally competent adult, you could survive any temperature indefinitely that normal home A/C systems can produce. But anyone too young, old, or sick to warm and protect themselves could be in danger at prolonged low temperatures. It would help if you narrowed this down.	2017-11-01 04:52:04Z	Carey Gregory

14163	That is broad! Has this to remain at very general level? At the latest when it hits paging this will likely need to be split up into sections (sep Qs). But interesting reasoning. Let's see how it goes.	2017-10-31 12:32:19Z	LangLangC
14163	@Narusan-sedated actually if it is an allergy you would see an allergist/immunologist. And I am not sure that this can be defined. And pathology has many more divisions. When I am not on mobile, I will make this a community wiki. We will see how it proceeds.	2017-11-02 02:35:17Z	JohnP
14163	I think we can keep pathology more general as they aren't someone people will go see.  Unless they're on the autopsy table, which is beyond the scope of this question ;)	2017-11-02 12:17:27Z	DoctorWhom
14163	@Narusan-sedated Ah, that 100% depends on your insurance, a topic which is insanely complicated in the U.S.  But PCPs can manage a lot more than most people realize, and there are often long waits for subspecialists, so those are 2 big reasons why the medical system generally recommends starting with a PCP.	2017-11-03 06:38:50Z	DoctorWhom

14116	@CareyGregory I just double checked everything and yes, I have copied everything correctly. Could "HBcAb" be the same thing as "anti-HBc" that does show up in the table?	2017-10-26 17:57:48Z	
14115	Interesting question, and by the tag it appears to be for the purpose of approaching teaching it in a memorable way.  The same way that many different people have proposed ways to break down personality into categories/factors, similarly there are many perspectives via which to look at health.  I am not sure if this question will yield the answer that you seek, especially since neither a single answer exists, nor is a comprehensive answer possible as there is not exactly a standard per se.  Specifying in your question that you seek an EXAMPLE of it might be best.	2017-10-26 03:20:08Z	DoctorWhom
14115	What about pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation? If anyone is wrong with any of these three values, you’re in trouble.	2017-10-26 09:10:21Z	Narusan-in-coma
14107	Seems unlikely you could do so at all without also knowing gender since gender will influence those ratios more than anything else.	2017-10-25 01:08:35Z	Carey Gregory
14107	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because I see little of none value to any answer of this question. A large database of body measurements is needed. If such a database exists, it will be the job of an author of the algorithm to work out statistical correlation between values, that is not suited for Health.SE. If such a database doesn’t exist, there will never be an answer.	2017-11-08 20:26:56Z	Narusan-in-coma
14107	[cont’d] Furthermore, I don’t think requests to links for databases are questions that should be asked at Health.SE and hence recommend closure.	2017-11-08 20:27:38Z	Narusan-in-coma
14107	If you know an exchange that this question would more fitting then I'm open to moving it. I'm making it this for simulations. The resulting values can help determine healthy BMI ranges.  I doubt the question can be answered without a large database and I have yet to find one either. Requesting one would not fit Stack Exchange either.	2017-11-08 20:52:19Z	
14107	For anyone else who may want to answer this question, I have a rough hip algorithm in Excel.  =(weight/5)+INDEX(buildValue, RANDBETWEEN(1, 3))+RANDBETWEEN(-1,1)  buildType = {0, 1.5, 3}  The buildType is based on ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph body types. The weight is in pounds and measurement result is in inches.	2017-11-08 20:52:31Z	
14106	(+1) Great question. Do you have a link to the research? That would make it easier for others to grasp your question and background.	2017-10-24 20:53:24Z	Narusan-in-coma
14106	Sure! Those with an institution-affiliated access to the journal Inflammatory Bowel Diseases can find it through it's pubmed id: 26313692. For others, I uploaded it to tinyupload: s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=62717937294032214010	2017-10-24 21:06:57Z	
14106	Diseases aren't a static entity.  They fluctuate depending on various factors including response to treatment and immunity.	2017-10-26 06:28:28Z	Graham Chiu
14106	Thanks so much for the response! So the inactive vs active state could vary week to week? If so, then I won't give it a lot of weight in my analysis. But if it's a more steady thing, like a remission in cancer, perhaps that's more important.	2017-10-26 11:25:52Z	
14106	The states shouldn't fluctuate wildly, but they do vary based on a multitude of factors. Often someone will be completely asymptomatic but colonoscopy shows active disease.	2017-10-27 05:19:14Z	Graham Chiu
14104	What would constitute an acceptable level of practice for a technique to be an alternative.  Written into a standard level of care?  You outline everything I've ever seen in your first paragraph, but I'll poke around as I have time today.	2017-11-29 16:38:36Z	Atl LED
14104	@AtlLED Well, are there any other options recommended than needle pain compression? If you can find a guideline saying needle chest compression is the only option, I‘m fine with that as well :) Thanks in advance!	2017-11-29 16:40:00Z	
14104	I mean I found a few  protocols that only list that option in the treatment, but that doesn't mean that it's exclusive.  I haven't been in the field in a while though, and I'm going to keep poking around. If there is an alternative the scope is definitely going to have to be in a hospital, I can't see a way for a field medic to expand their practice.	2017-11-29 17:11:56Z	Atl LED
14104	@AtlLED All resources I checked Hint that NCC is the only option. Feel free to post that as an answer so that someone gets the benefit of my bounty :)	2017-11-30 12:55:43Z

14102	Hey @ammianus. I’ve edited your question to remove (irrelevant) personal detail, we can’t give personal medical advice so we generally want questions to be as broad as possible without being too broad.	2017-10-24 15:21:20Z	Narusan-in-coma
14102	@Narusan-sedated I understand, I'm used to stackoverflow where questions are asked based on specific context. I just want to make clear that the question has to do with the concurrent infection of common-cold with receiving the vaccine, not that I'm sick with the cold and had the flu vaccine some other time.	2017-10-24 15:24:18Z

14093	I edited your question heavily to comply with site rules. Requests for personal medical advice are off topic here, but your question has value so I tried to make it relevant for a general audience. You can revert my edits if you object.	2017-10-24 04:29:44Z	Carey Gregory

14080	Good question but I edited according to your own suggestion because asking which part of the body is most sensitive is mostly a matter of opinion.	2017-10-23 04:11:08Z	Carey Gregory
14080	Unfortunately, your last edit completely changed the nature of the question and invalidated the two answers you had. Going forward, what do you mean by "flat skin?" Are the lips flat skin? How about finger tips?	2017-10-25 01:04:18Z	Carey Gregory
14080	What @CareyGregory said, and doubly so. And what shall those vibes effect? In a grid? Arouse or relax? Genuine massage or erotic? Some other 'fun'?	2017-10-25 17:25:53Z	LangLangC
14080	Again, I do apologise for this. @CareyGregory any flat surface in the skin where a square could be attached.	2017-10-26 01:41:49Z	
14080	@LangLangC , I am after perception of shapes with a vibrator grid. e.g. vibrating a star shaped formation in the grid.	2017-10-26 01:43:46Z	
14078	Those estimates vary by only 16% at the extremes.Your personal deviation from whatever data they're using could easily be more than that. As for which one is most accurate, have you read those web sites to find out where they get their data and how they calculate their numbers?	2017-10-23 04:24:26Z	Carey Gregory
14078	Calorie needs does vary.  Track your weight and calorie intake and see what is your steady state.  I weigh more than you and my body only needs about 1400 calories a day.	2017-10-23 16:14:08Z	Paparazzi
14078	Could you elucidate on how you tracked your weight and calorie intake to arrive at your steady state of 1400 cals/day? What's your gender, height, age, and activity level?	2017-10-25 21:34:37Z

14041	Can you? Yes, obviously. I know quite a few people who do that. I’m quite the opposite of you - I brush regularly and even so I still get stains very easily. I don’t really see what you want though, TBH. Is a case example of someone who died without cavity proof enough? Maybe you can help me out understanding the core of your question...	2017-10-20 12:03:19Z	Narusan-in-coma
14041	As posed this is a yes or no question. Usually we like to give slightly longer answers. For that to happen you need to remove a little weakness of this question: Currently it is a bit unclear what you are asking. Please refine your question with the help of Narusan's comment and the help.	2017-10-20 12:31:11Z	LangLangC
14041	How do you know you've never had a cavity? Do you still go for regular 6 month dental cleanings and therefore have a record from the past ~30 years of never needing fillings?	2017-10-20 13:42:12Z	WakeDemons3
14041	@WakeDemons3, I go the dentist every couple of years.	2017-10-20 18:03:54Z	
14041	@LangLangC, I am just looking for an answer the question??? Is this not a Q & A site to gather information? It is a very simple question, "Is it possible to never get a cavity in someone who lives to the average lifespan of a human?"	2017-10-20 18:06:50Z	
14039	can some one have a courtesy of telling me why this  down vote?	2017-10-20 10:49:48Z	
14039	Welcome to Health.SE. Question and request regarding personalised medical advice are strictly off-topic here. Feel free to take the tour and look at the other help documents. To salvage this question and possibly reverse the downvote you need to edit your question and remove all personal information. Make it much more general, (not  about "some person" etc.). In its current form I will also have to downvote this and it will likely be closed, I'm afraid. If you manage to salvage this, I will remove that vote.	2017-10-20 12:25:51Z	LangLangC
14039	Thx for your edit. +0 now. // (If you want to improve you question further please add a bit of what your research up to now might  have revealed (or not.))	2017-10-22 15:07:16Z	LangLangC

14037	@GrahamChiu Not severely but there is a measurable decrease. Remember that the CO in cigarette smoke fools pulse oximetry.	2017-10-20 00:41:04Z	Carey Gregory
14037	I was objecting to the term plummet	2017-10-20 01:02:27Z	Graham Chiu
14037	@GrahamChiu Figure of speech. I was rather joking too...	2017-10-20 04:53:03Z	Narusan-in-coma
14030	I think the contents are in the patent.	2017-10-18 22:40:21Z	Paparazzi
14030	When you patent, you have to tell the world how to replicate your invention.	2017-10-19 02:08:08Z	Carey Gregory
14030	So why do they patent it? Are they afraid the information will leak?	2017-10-19 06:05:48Z	
14030	So they have patent protection for X years.  If they don't patent someone could come up with it independently.	2017-10-19 15:07:46Z	Paparazzi

14025	It doesn’t really sound like lice. My solution will work for almost any kind of parasite, but depending on local healthcare structures, it might be more convenient to have this checked out by a GP.	2017-10-18 13:26:48Z	Narusan-in-coma
14025	As your question already has a close vote for “too personal”, I’ve edited your question heavily to remove personal details which are not necessary to provide an answer. If you disagree, feel free to rollback	2017-10-18 20:57:23Z	Narusan-in-coma
14025	@Narusan-in-coma your edit makes my question imply that I'm almost sure I have lice. In fact I'm almost determined it's something else. Lice causes itchiness, which is why I pointed out the lack of it. Lice wouldn't be tingling me in a consistent location on my head either.	2017-10-19 01:00:28Z	
14025	Honestly, sometimes skin just tingles, that’s not necessarily a sign of having lice. I’m writing this comment because the two answers seem to assume you are suffering from lice, while the question is more on the lines of “I have a tingling sensation on my head, what could it be”.	2017-10-19 08:52:32Z	Philipp
14025	@Philipp Well, the question was how to test for lice and other parasites. I explained how to test for lice (and some other parasites will be killed and brushed out by the treatment as well) and stated that otherwise, a visit to the doctor is necessary. I’ve edited my answer to make that a bit clearer. Thanks for the feedback!	2017-10-19 09:18:39Z	Narusan-in-coma

14008	You need to boil this down to a single specific question rather than asking for a comprehensive overview with pros and cons. Pros and cons are usually matters of opinion. Also, clarify what you mean by "better." Better in what way? Healthier?	2017-10-17 18:03:21Z	Carey Gregory

14008	@FaheemMitha Asking for a comprehensive overview sounds like a lot more than simply "which is better," and as I said, pros and cons are usually matters of opinion.

13955	No. Avoiding meat and fish without ensuring other sources of protein would be very bad. Meat in general is not considered something to avoid in pregnancy. There are some issues around certain raw foods, but questions asking for lists are not a good fit for this site. It is probably best to ask one question about one food you're specifically concerned about rather than a broad list question.	2017-10-12 15:09:57Z	Kate Gregory
13955	It's recommended to limit fish intake, especially in pregnancy, due to mercury content of fish.  Vegetables contain adequate protein but raw vegetables make it harder to obtain that protein.  Listeria is a problem in some unpasteurised  foods.  See also mpi.govt.nz/food-safety/pregnant-and-at-risk-people/…	2017-10-14 22:52:11Z	Graham Chiu

13936	Regarding your addition: That’s encouraging to hear. You already addressed this in your post with “talk to them reassuringly”, but I’ll edit it into my answer. Touching lightly on the shoulder should not cause any problems (use common sense there, if she’s having a violent fit, maybe not), and talking and taking care of the psychological aspects is an often underrated aspect - hence my encouragement for privacy.	2017-10-11 14:29:54Z	Narusan-in-coma
13936	@Narusan-in-coma I once helped out at the Epilepsy Centre in the UK and some of the severe sufferers had very considerable disability from repeated convulsions. Some of them used to wear a rubber ring around their head to protect them when they fell during seizure. One young man I helped with had no front teeth, having lost them in a fall fit. It can be a very serious condition indeed.	2017-10-11 14:34:33Z	
13936	From what I’ve heard, the first few occurrences are the most shocking. I can imagine - losing control over your muscles must be a horrible feeling. Once one gets accustomed to it, the psychological aspects are less severe, and some form of protection (rubber ring, having good friends near you who know of your condition) can be of assistance. So can having a well-trained security warden.	2017-10-11 14:45:43Z	Narusan-in-coma

13934	I can't think of any mechanism by which this would happen, except the possibility of a correlation with the underlying reason you have so much sputum to expectorate.  Not with the increased pressure from coughing.  That said, you should see a doc about why you have so much sputum ro why it's so hard to get out that you need to put high pressure in your head - there are potential health risks to frequently creating increased intrathoracic and intracranial pressure.	2017-10-15 08:48:54Z	DoctorWhom

13930	@Krushe, your question will likely be closed because it doesn't fit the site guidelines.  It is a good question in general, but not the right kind of question for this site. It could be SAVED if you change it to be more like "what education background is generally required in order to understand and study advanced topics in cancer?"  That is more objective, and my answer would then fit it.  I do not think you would obtain an answer to your original question as it stands now.	2017-10-11 17:39:57Z	DoctorWhom

13928	Clearly you want the 'benefits' of green tea. But one of those is taste. Either you destroy some of the 'benefits'/the taste by really boiling it or you need to update the info in your question with some details: like e.g. temperature, what else you boil in there, how often you clean it etc. This is also to avoid too much similarity to this question: health.stackexchange.com/q/3545/11231	2017-10-10 16:05:58Z	LangLangC
13928	If you're bringing water to a boil then bacteria and fungi won't be a problem because they'll be killed off. How often you should clean it is mostly about taste and aesthetics, not health.	2017-10-10 19:11:29Z	Carey Gregory
13928	Wouldn't that mold/bacteria per definition get into your tea if you boil your water in the boiler, no matter where you put the tea bag?	2017-10-12 20:55:46Z	DonQuiKong
13928	@DonQuiKong I think he means that the tea itself provides a nutrient source for bacteria/mold; not having that in the container makes it much harder for mold/bacteria to survive	2017-10-15 08:41:24Z	DoctorWhom
13928	Boiling doesn't kill all fungal spores. That's why we use autoclaves. Generally heating for 90 minutes at 120 degrees centigrade will sterilize most things. Prions require 132 degrees for an hour.	2017-10-16 10:23:54Z	Graham Chiu
13926	But the body reacts to all these perturbations as it is a self regulating machine. We can pull only a few strings, while the machine itself has enormously more regulating mechanisms. The only relevant effects are going to be determined by how such exercises end up influencing the long term physical fitness. If you are going to be physically stronger and and up exercising harder and as a result eating more and what you eat is healthy food, then that's going to make your cancer risk go down.	2017-10-10 23:58:16Z	Count Iblis
13926	@CountIblis: I was trying to find some evidence how small/big the impact of such short term metabolic perturbations really is, but I couldn't find anything. Angiogenesis inhibitors seem to emerge as a key factor in cancer prevention (see e.g. this TED talk). That is actually how many of these "healthy foods" work (Journal on Oncology). However, from a physiological perspective, the exercise seems to promote angiogenesis. Considering only long term fitness is a bit over-simplified in my opinion.	2017-10-17 19:10:48Z

13920	Found it! The study is really old, published 1939, somewhat lacking proper scientific methods and data, and your Cracked jumped to the wrong conclusion: They had nothing really to kill themselves (it was a fairly foolproof diet), and the results of the study is somewhat limited.

13915	Depends on how long after pregnancy and how high cholesterol. Elevated cholesterol is necessary during pregnancy, the fetus needs it to develop properly. Note: always check the LDL/HDL ratio too, not just the cholesterol. It should be under 3.5, but under 2 is it really good. HDL helps to clean up cholesterol from blood vessels.	2017-10-10 01:22:51Z	inf3rno

13875	Before the patient is been taking to the ED of a hospital, the ambulance checks whether the ED can accept another patient (in Germany, but I assume it to be international standard). This also has the advantage that the hospital is well-prepared and knows what specialists to call before arrival of patient, making treatment a lot more efficient. Otherwise the ambulance will target a different ED that’s further away directly. It really isn’t likely that there is no surgeon on call, it’s a huge hospital and they will find one. The bigger problem is the availability of beds and surgeon rooms.	2017-10-05 12:38:26Z	Narusan-in-coma
13875	Can you add some details? As it stands, this is very broad and regionally dependent. It would also depend on what level of hospital/trauma center the facility is, and what type of internal bleeding.

13867	Farting is excessive gas or, medically, flatulence. Swallowing air can contribute to bloating, but not likely to excessive gas. Common causes of bloating and gas are lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption and celiac disease (they all typically run in families).

13846	To put this VERY short -- I don't have time to reference this but my understanding is as you lose hair cells, you lose the ability to hear higher frequencies.  The damage is caused by simply high dB noise, what pitch of sound is lost is not directly related to the type of sound your exposed to (i.e low freq over exposure does not cause low freq sensitivity to decrease).  It's more of a general damage to the entire organ with the higher freq's being lost first.  There are GREAT youtube videos on this BTW!	2017-10-03 15:12:42Z	Mike-DHSc

13833	I am not aware whether a resource exists for an online counselor or psychologist.  I've seen some ads, but don't know if they are legitimate.  Unfortunately this is not the best place to seek that advice.  I recommend a psychologist. If you have seen one and did not like them, try to see a different one.  Sometimes it takes more than one try to find one that you connect with and feel helps you.	2017-10-02 06:59:58Z	DoctorWhom
13833	You know talking and talking again repeating my story I don't feel good.I neither feel good to talk face face and about some issues , i have gone to psychologists before but it didn't help me out because there weren't solotions and I am not feel free to talk and concetrated .It will be better to share my problem with someone from Internet (I search someone to listen and give me an advice) .Anyway , thanks	2017-10-02 09:38:58Z	
13830	I don't think your question can be answered with any degree of certainty from this description. A photo would help.	2017-10-01 16:40:29Z	Carey Gregory
13830	It's called an abrasion. And I was looking for photos but none are minor enough to fit it. They're all serious damage with yellowing. But regardless of severity, it's called an abrasion.	2017-10-01 17:21:43Z	
13830	From your description it could also have been an avulsion.	2017-10-02 14:12:11Z	Carey Gregory
13827	I recommend you talk with your psychiatrist about the different classes of antidepressants, as there are ones that tend to have more activating effects.  We can't go into detail advice here.  But Benzos are sedating as a class.  If it alleviated a symptom that was affecting your energy, that may explain it, but it isn't a solid plan.  I am not a fan of benzos at all due to addiction, tolerance, and paradoxical anxiety effects.	2017-10-03 04:54:00Z	DoctorWhom
13824	Why are you getting scans? Are they necessary to look for a serious problem ? Weigh the risks. Also consider a different doctor; A local Dr has done as many as 4 prostate biopsies on a patient in several years ( and found nothing). Which I think is excessive .	2017-10-01 21:11:22Z	blacksmith37
13824	What happened is I edited your question to comply with site rules. My only alternative was to vote to close it. If you had read the help center you would have known that requests for medical advice are off topic here. You can click edit and revert my changes, but if you do the question will be off topic again and will probably be closed. That would be a shame because you have an excellent answer.	2017-10-02 03:27:26Z	Carey Gregory
13824	I didn't feel like it was a request for medical advice. It was for reassurance regarding CT scan risk, and it included the backstory of my scans, so one could have all the information in order to help me with the CT scan risk. Thank you, anyway.	2017-10-02 04:01:39Z	
13824	I left all the information necessary for someone to help you with the risks and someone did. The backstory wouldn't change the answer. It's a solid answer so believe it.	2017-10-02 04:54:07Z	Carey Gregory
13824	Even if it doesn't feel like it, Winter, adding "backstory" to a question about a health topic quickly turns it into a personal advice question.  It is best to just ask the root question and leave out details.  By editing your question to follow the rules, @CareyGregory saved your question from being closed.  See this meta for more explanation:  health.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/747/…	2017-10-04 03:01:39Z	DoctorWhom
13819	I'm just going to edit it, for his sake. @InStReSs revert it if you disagree with the edit.	2017-09-30 17:05:10Z	DoctorWhom
13817	Well, a human is involved, so there’s always the potential of a mistake. I’d say it’s quite unlikely though.	2017-09-30 14:47:46Z	Narusan-in-coma
13817	Assuming the doctor did it perfectly can it still be missed i.e. is there any error with the test itself.	2017-10-01 03:31:26Z	
13817	No. There really isn't anything to the test other than the doctor's eyeballs, so if they miss it, the doctor failed. If the endoscope itself failed, that would be obvious to the doctor and they would have to repeat the exam.	2017-10-01 23:20:53Z	Carey Gregory
13817	It uses an endscope which has limits and the symptoms have to visually detectable.	2017-10-02 07:49:45Z	
13817	A typical symptom of a peptic ulcer is epigastric pain and not gas (flatulence). In an ulcer caused by H. pylori bacteria, the additional symptoms could be nausea and excessive belching. The most common cause of gas is probably eating a lot of foods high in soluble fiber (legumes, oats, barley...) or polyols, such as sorbitol (in some sodas, chewing gum...). Other common causes are lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption, celiac disease and intestinal parasites. There are tests available for each of them. Additionally, the irritable bowel syndrome can cause a feeling of bloating.	2017-10-04 14:13:22Z	Jan
13815	I don't think that's so well known, actually. The brain and seizures can't be reduced down to a simple electrical circuit model.	2017-09-30 04:56:25Z	Carey Gregory
13815	@DoctorWhom do you have a source on that? That sounds like an answer!	2017-09-30 15:01:28Z	
13815	@RobertColumbia Sorry that wasn't the best way to phrase it. I wish I had more time to do justice to an answer - - but to summarize, waveforms for EEGs focus on frequency (Hz) and amplitude (uV) to describe "spike" patterns.  It's not necessarily the quantity of electricity (though it is usually higher amplitude) - it's more the pattern of discharge that gives the seizure activity.  This is technical but  ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK390347/#pt7.s4	2017-09-30 15:49:41Z	DoctorWhom
13811	No, not really. They all have similar causes, but both symptoms and treatment varies so much you can hardly call them similar aspects of a disease. Also, I’m not aware of the Heart Disease, there are myocardial infractions, malfunctioning heart valves and many more diseases connected to the heart.	2017-09-29 16:59:59Z	Narusan-in-coma
13811	In what way is Alzheimer's caused by clogged up plumbing?	2017-09-30 05:07:54Z	Carey Gregory

13811	If that were the case, then Avascular Necrosis of the femoral head would also be the "same disease" as it is caused by fatty emboli blocking the tiny veins in the femur.	2017-10-20 13:46:08Z	WakeDemons3
13807	because there's no single effective antibiotic .. you'd need to culture the bug to ascertain sensitivities before treatment.  Simpler to use triple therapy.	2017-09-30 21:57:27Z	Graham Chiu
13807	@GrahamChiu This does not look like a comment but like something that might be put into an answer. With a bit more words and references, you know.	2017-10-01 15:47:20Z	LangLangC
13806	I have exactly same condition. But I have been taking Lamitor OD 200 only since past 5 years. I had this condition from age 15, when I did not take this medicine. To alleviate my condition my doctor has given me Eye Mist eyedrop and I take it from 10 to 15 times a day. Especially when I have to spend long hours in front of computer, my condition worsens.	2017-09-29 08:53:32Z	Sonevol
13806	This is the first time I have met someone who suffers from the same condition.	2017-09-29 08:56:09Z	Sonevol
13806	@aduckinthewinter Yeah, I would accept that if it were expanded into an answer. I am seeing my doctor in about 2.5 weeks. I was planning to ask her.	2017-09-30 05:36:10Z	
13801	Are you asking about commercially produced foods that have ingredients labels? Or home-canned foods? If the latter, if you are using a boiling-water bath you are urged to add lemon juice and salt. Only with a pressure canner can you skip acidification. If the former, can't you just read the ingredients list?	2017-09-29 22:19:15Z	Kate Gregory
13801	I'm asking about commercial foods.  I agree that it seems like the ingredients list should list any added acids, so I'm baffled by these authors' claims and trying to figure out where they come from.	2017-09-30 14:56:17Z	
13800	What kind of fasting is meant here? Totally avoiding both food and water for the entire day for more than one day? Or fasting just for some hours within a day?	2017-09-29 11:39:40Z	Jan
13800	Totally avoiding food and water for a continuous 24 hour period.	2017-09-29 15:30:58Z	
13799	What’s PGD medication? You might want to spell out that abbreviation for non-UK’s who don’t know the abbreviations.	2017-09-28 14:51:12Z	Narusan-in-coma
13795	I‘ve flagged this question for mod attention, there is a site “PhysicalFitness.SE” where this would be a better fit. It’s off-topic here.	2017-09-28 05:34:11Z	Narusan-in-coma
13795	@Narusan-in-coma Hit refresh and look at it now. It's not off topic at all. It's a cardiology question.	2017-09-28 05:36:05Z	Carey Gregory
13795	@CareyGregory I haven’t VTC, but I think that OP would get better answers over at Fitness.SE.	2017-09-28 07:34:32Z	Narusan-in-coma
13795	@Narusan-in-coma - Fitness is not a dumping ground for anything that could possibly be exercise. In this case, it would quickly be closed, as we have no idea what would be a normal heart rate without a clinical MHR test.	2017-09-28 14:35:23Z	JohnP
13795	@JohnP My apologies if I sounded like that. I’ll probably have a few visits at Fitness.SE to better grasp the concept of this site.	2017-09-28 14:41:39Z	Narusan-in-coma
13775	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's not about health.	2017-09-26 05:22:15Z	Graham Chiu
13775	@GrahamChiu - While you are correct, it does not fit into the original scope for health, it does fit with the new direction that many of the users want to take the site in. I will let the community decide on the viability of the question.	2017-09-26 19:47:21Z	JohnP
13775	@JohnP If this is targeted at us, we have reconsidered and are vouching for a sister site. You might call us splitters :P. I’ll stay active on both sides (given the new site makes it to beta)	2017-09-26 21:21:59Z	Narusan-in-coma
13775	@JohnP this is tough either way as it is borderline opinion or experience based - but I do feel it would fit MedicalSciences, it's just not even in Beta yet.	2017-09-27 02:46:47Z	DoctorWhom
13775	I want to see a few hundred other questions closed before this one is.	2017-09-27 04:58:08Z	Carey Gregory
13770	Is this homework?  And what steps have you taken to answer this yourself?	2017-09-26 05:23:21Z	Graham Chiu
13770	We have a similar rule like Biology that homework questions are off topic.  If this is an MCAT question or something that you're looking for clarification on, please specify that.	2017-09-28 07:00:29Z	DoctorWhom
13769	Tick are arachnids, fleas are insects. The former has eight legs, the latter, six. I would think the color of either would depend on the species in question.	2017-09-24 23:02:44Z	BillDOe
13769	Bill is correct.  Also she should do a full self skin exam and look for any attached ticks, and remove them according to cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html  and since it's been more than 2 days, she should see a doctor if she finds anything unusual.	2017-09-25 00:30:00Z	DoctorWhom
13769	Neither ticks nor fleas would remain immobile on her pants, so if those dots have been there for two days the answer is neither. I don't think this question can be answered.	2017-09-25 20:47:17Z	Carey Gregory
13767	If you are trying to avoid future breakouts I'm not sure if sugar water is a good choice. You might want to do a little more research on that. Good luck!	2017-09-24 14:53:07Z	
13767	@EricaGrant even with lemon? It's hard to drink lemon juice without sugar	2017-09-24 15:00:41Z	Murad
13767	I'm not sure that technique is the most efficient way to increase your vitamin C levels. You should be able to increase your vitamin C levels by eating more whole foods that are rich in vitamin C or adding a vitamin C supplement to your diet: draxe.com/vitamin-c-foods	2017-09-24 15:05:42Z

13767	I'm not sure if the picture shows acne scars and marks. At least some of those spots are probably active acne papules. I believe, acne are triggered by stress. Merely reducing stress, even for a bit, such as by having regular sleep, avoiding too much foods you feel they are not good for you and concentrating on work you feel is right for you, can  help a lot.	2017-09-28 15:45:02Z	Jan
13766	If you're consuming salt to obtain trace minerals, your diet is in a whole lot more trouble than a lack of trace minerals. I suspect the only "experts" who recommend expensive salt are the "experts" selling expensive salt.	2017-09-24 19:43:45Z	Carey Gregory
13766	It's a scam.  And of course lacking iodine.	2017-09-26 05:20:45Z	Graham Chiu
13763	That's a terse and yet broad question. If you could expand on your current research and reasoning? e.g. Is it mainly about cholesterol in chicken eggs?	2017-09-23 20:29:18Z	LangLangC
13763	Maybe cardiology testing has been done on UK islands where they live on sea bird eggs for months and then eat preserved eggs the rest of the year.	2017-09-24 01:50:01Z	blacksmith37
13763	Exactly! I'm curious about the impact of chicken egg consumption, assuming (nearly) vacuum sealed experimental conditions. Eggs contain a mix of MUFAs, PUFAs, sat, & trans fats, etc...What's their rough net effect?	2017-09-24 03:11:37Z

13763	I had not. Just getting around to looking into this question; apologies for my laziness.	2017-09-24 19:19:59Z	
13758	No, this is scientific nonsense. What is problematic is the dilution of "unwanted stuff" and that doesn't decrease when donating a part of the whole blood. The "unwanted-to-wanted" ration stays the same.	2017-09-23 17:24:27Z	Narusan-in-coma
13746	I have edited your question to make it more applicable to the site, and not just a "recommend me" type question. If you do not agree with the edits, please respond and I will roll them back (Although it may make your question likely to be closed).	2017-09-22 20:13:35Z	JohnP
13746	@Narusan-in-coma - See my comment above. Rather than always immediately voting to close, see if there is a way to salvage the question and bring it more into alignment with where the site is and where we want it to be.	2017-09-22 20:14:31Z	JohnP
13746	@JohnP Thank you for taking the time to edit the question. I would be very surprised (in a positive way) if such a resource exist, I didn’t even consider that to be an option. But in the end, we’re all here to learn.	2017-09-22 20:36:47Z	Narusan-in-coma

13743	Are you sure it's acetaminophen, not aspirin?  Acetaminophen is generally for pain or fever, and post-MI has a better safety profile than NSAIDs.  I googled Dolo 325; it showed a mix of Tramadol/Acetaminophen, which would make it similar to other opioid pain medications like Norco (Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen).	2017-09-23 06:49:14Z	DoctorWhom
13743	I'm certain, it is acetaminophen	2017-09-23 07:17:24Z

Flying a long distance (intercontinental) at a high altitude (50K+ miles above the earth's surface) increases risk, but only very slightly.	2017-09-21 16:15:20Z	anongoodnurse
13730	@anongoodnurse Just because I like to pick at nits, it's 50k feet... 50k miles would be 1/5 of the way to the moon, and definitely much higher radiation risk!	2017-09-21 17:48:21Z	Joe

It reminds me of that scene in "Catch Me if You Can" where Leo DiCaprio is interviewing young women for stewardess positions, and one of them 'pretend announces', Ladies and gentlemen, We'll be traveling at 6,000 miles per hour at an altitude of 300 feet.” Hahahahaha!	2017-09-21 21:16:15Z	anongoodnurse

13722	As Carey said, it's not the vaccine;  your sneezing could be seasonal allergies or a myriad of other things. Totally unrelated. You can't get the flu from the flu vaccine.  Get whatever vaccine that is available.	2017-09-21 01:43:55Z	DoctorWhom
13722	Also, flu vaccines are highly different from year to year. Basically (as I understand it) they are versions of whichever flu variant the health professionals think are going to be the most prevalent each season.	2017-09-22 20:06:20Z	JohnP
13722	@JohnP Furthermore, the flu virus itself is mutating a lot, meaning there is need for multiple vaccinations and new vaccines. In Germany, vaccination against the flu is not recommended for the majority of patients because it would have to be renewed every year to be effective. It is encouraged very much for the elderly though because a flu could be lethal for an already strained immune system.	2017-09-22 20:13:32Z	Narusan-in-coma
13722	@Narusan-in-coma Vaccinating every year is exactly what is recommended in the US for everyone. Considering how inexpensive the flu vaccine is and how dreadfully ill it can make even a young, healthy person, skipping it seems "penny wise, pound foolish."	2017-09-22 22:01:57Z	Carey Gregory

13706	Are you getting the e-versions? Are you a medical student? Or just a very interested self-taught layperson? Because textbooks are very expensive and become outdated quickly. A disease is a disease is a disease until genetics, microbiology and technology took a giant leap into the picture. Now things change almost daily. Also, people have their favorites.

13697	This can't be answered, just commented that in the USA, a drug company can charge whatever it wants to whenever it wants to.  There are some contract rates but it varies widely.  I agree with scope issues and voted close.	2017-09-21 07:37:52Z	DoctorWhom
13694	Hey Yette, I'm sorry to hear that. We can't gibe you a personal medical diagnosis (I.e. tell you what your health problem is), so I have edited out your personal clinical information. The question can stand on itself the way it is now. // If you have already visited 10 doctors, I'd suggest rushing to one of them (or another one) when the symptoms are very strong. That's the last thing that comestibles my mind. If you actually have difficulty breathing and an inability to stand up, you might want to visit an EHR (depending on the setup of your local health system). Hope that you get well soon!	2017-09-19 19:52:39Z	Narusan-in-coma
13694	The answer to your question is yes, in some health conditions and/or medications.  It's impossible to answer this question generally, as there are too many variations to discuss in an answer.  It would have to be individualized, which we can't do here.  Gather all your results and take them to a primary care doctor (or GP or whatever they're called where you're from) along with a list of your symptoms (in chronological order) and questions.  Good luck!	2017-09-20 06:16:13Z	DoctorWhom

13690	This is a question that requires an individualized diagnosis.  The fact you've had a workup is reassuring but we can't say one way or another without knowing the tests that were/weren't done and the results and your medical history and meds and family history and other symptoms and vitals and orthostatics and... none of that can happen here.  So it's got to be your doctor who advises you, or it's not safe. Did the doctors give you advice how to treat the symptoms?  If not, go back and ask them specifically how to manage it.  Make sure they know you still have these symptoms.	2017-09-20 08:18:14Z	DoctorWhom

13678	Excellent question!	2017-09-18 02:21:57Z	DoctorWhom
13678	I don't have time to look for research at the moment (hopefully someone can jump in sooner or later!) - but the issue is it hasn't been around long enough to know its safety long term.  NOT a valid reference, but worthwhile mentioning: I asked this question to one of the leading researchers on vaping in the USA 2 years ago.  She said that in the process to create vapor, hydrocarbons in the solution (flavors etc) undergo combustion.  Products of hydrocarbon combustion are toxic (e.g. it's part of air pollution) but it's not clear yet in what amounts we will see clinical reactions.	2017-09-18 02:32:04Z	DoctorWhom
13678	Good question but I wonder if it has good answers given how new vaping is. I think one can safely assume that vaping is not a healthy thing to do so the only real question is how unhealthy is it?	2017-09-18 03:54:57Z	Carey Gregory
13678	AFAIK,  vaping doesn't contain as many tobacco as cigarettes (if any), so it definitely is healthier than smoking. That's not difficult to achieve though...	2017-09-18 05:11:38Z	Narusan-in-coma
13678	@Narusan I think you mean nicotine.  The interesting thing is that often people tend to vape MORE because of it and end up with much higher nicotine intake in the end!  Studies are really interesting on the subject. But yeah, I like "how unhealthy is it" Carey.	2017-09-18 14:14:52Z	DoctorWhom
13669	It's unclear what you mean by blood circulation.  Can you provide the information you've found so far when trying to answer your own question, then we can get a better idea of what you want to know.	2017-09-17 08:16:32Z	DoctorWhom
13669	Ive read that after eating a heavy meal or food with lot of sugar, the rate of blood circulation reduces, like wise will foods that are hard to digest reduce the blood circulation in the body?	2017-09-17 08:23:55Z	
13669	What do you mean by the rate of blood circulation? I'm not aware of a term like this. The amount of blood that circulates is a combination between blood pressure and pulse.	2017-09-17 09:20:34Z	Narusan-in-coma
13669	This is unclear what you are asking, and very broad as well. If you can clarify and give more detail, you can nominate to be reopened.	2017-09-20 16:18:21Z	JohnP
13668	The problem is "ALL diseases" encompasses thousands of things, from the common cold to genetic diseases, mental diseases, etc. No single source will cover all that, so if that's what you mean, your question is far too broad. Or did you mean only infectious diseases? If so, that can be answered.	2017-09-17 02:43:42Z	Carey Gregory
13668	@CareyGregory I meant all of them. But if there is no single source of all diseases, even categorized ones are also welcomed. e.g. All genetic diseases, mental diseases etc.	2017-09-17 06:19:12Z	
13668	" I want always be sure that doctors not making mistake when diagnosing." - You could go get enough education to be Gregory House and still not be sure of that. And consulting "Dr. Google" about symptoms can convince you that you should have been dead 3 weeks ago. I applaud the interest, but I would trust in the people that have obtained the degrees and certifications.	2017-09-20 16:14:27Z	JohnP

13666	Any way I can boost this question?  It seems like people think it's a good question, but it's not getting much attention.	2017-09-28 00:22:24Z	
13663	Talk to a medical professor. There are reasons why something has been the case and it's easy to overlook aspects as an outsider (just think of how many people think they know better than Einstein without having studied physics). In case you overlooked something, the professor will help you clarify with that. In case you haven't, she can provide information on how to publish.	2017-09-16 20:15:21Z	Narusan-in-coma
13663	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because patents and legal aspects of medicine are off-topic here. I suspect Academics.SE to be a better fit, or maybe there is a designated site for patents etc.	2017-09-16 20:16:38Z	Narusan-in-coma
13663	Definitely considered talking to somebody... who would not laugh me off...  however there is the risk that they may claim they were the first to think about it.	2017-09-16 20:53:00Z	
13663	I think it has no legal value though. Notary public signature with a date costs less than 5 bucks in my area, that's much less than a lawyer. I am not saying this is such a case, but many multi-million legal fights would have been prevented by such measures.	2017-09-16 23:21:19Z	
13663	Unfortunately, I agree that these questions do not fall under the scope of this site. However there is a Law SE site for the patent question and Academia SE for the question on publishing your results. My 2 cents: get the advice on protecting your idea first and than co-publish a paper with someone from the field (who will review it and maybe give some useful suggestions as well). Best of luck!	2017-09-17 02:45:54Z	Lucky

13660	Hey Pratyush, welcome to Health.SE. We can not - and will not - tell you whether your home remedy will work. Your doctor has only ruled out that the foot is broken, but there are multiple different causes for your symptoms that we can't verify without access to these X-rays and your foot! If the pain is immanent, please visit the doctor again (or call the ambulance if the pain is so bad that you are not able to walk or stand up anymore). This is the only way one can help you. Once the doctor has confirmed what is wrong with you (if you would suffer from hypothetical XYZ), you can come back	2017-09-16 17:18:36Z	Narusan-in-coma

13671	I would imagine it's for two reasons: (1) the patient generally won't experience pain during this procedure, so what's the need for general anesthetic?, and (2) if there's a complication during the procedure, and the patient is awake, they can communicate to the physician what they're experiencing, which will then allow the physician to resolve the situation more quickly (assuming the description provided by the patient is detailed and accurate enough). This is mostly speculation though.	2017-09-16 12:05:51Z	Charles
13671	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this topic isn't about biology, it's about protocols during a clinical procedure. I'd recommend trying at Health.SE.

13657	I can't post this as an answer, since I don't know this diet and can't explain its plan. But for any weight loss, you generally do not want to go below 1200 kcal/day as a female (1500 as a male) without a doctor's close guidance.  And it's important to focus on balancing your diet with nutrient-dense foods.  But I have to state that I question the sustainability of weight loss from a diet requiring you to do something dramatically different from  when you reach your target weight.  I am a proponent of paradigm-shift diets like the Full Plate Diet or the principles in How Not to Die.	2017-09-17 06:32:03Z	DoctorWhom

13644	Voted to reopen, it's a good question.  But unfortunately I am not aware of there being significant evidence to support either of those claims. There are doctors who ascribe to different theories on nutrition, but the strength of their evidence varies.  One of my go-to's for nutrition/exercise evidence is the American College of Lifestyle Medicine. I've done some of their professional curriculum and find their evidence evaluation to be very strong.

13637	I'm not aware of it, and I think it's because the degree of head trauma varies dramatically based on the specific sport, organization, and individuals (e.g. Kung Fu sparring in forms vs MMA brawls).  Perhaps look at the data for boxing, since much of MMA today isn't much different than boxing in body damage, sometimes worse.  I sparred all the time in Kung Fu and never hit my head.  That versus my neighbor who was knocked out regularly in MMA... lots of confounding variables.	2017-09-15 07:27:34Z	DoctorWhom

The sequelae answer was "knee and hip pain possibly" and weren't impressed by my suggestion of arthritis and other joint degeneration.  My reading, however, is mixed and I did not find much.	2017-09-08 22:23:28Z	
13552	I would guess that it may be because they are flying where the ozone layer is thinner so exposed to more ultraviolet radiation. They are also sometimes exposed to chemicals from aerotoxic events.

13550	Actually this is a very pertinent Environmental Health topic on which I wrote a term paper in my MPH. I vote to keep it - largely because I am going to answer it in a health-focused way.  If you still feel it belongs in chemistry or would be good copied over there as well, pls migrate my answer too.	2017-09-08 04:05:50Z	DoctorWhom
13550	Belongs there, yes.  Belongs here, also yes, IMHO. If environmental and occupational health is off topic, what about other public health realms?  This is a textbook Env Health topic... What about pollution particulates and preventing asthma?  Ozone depletion and preventing skin cancer?  I still vote keep.	2017-09-08 08:15:42Z	DoctorWhom

13536	Welcome Parish! This is a really broad question and is likely to be closed for being too broad to answer reasonably. I would recommend adjusting it to ask for a specific nutrient like protein or another more narrow (and thus answerable) question.  It almost sounds like you're asking how to eat vegetarian in general, but I'm assuming you did prior to moving and are coming from a country with more vegetarian food variety into a more meat-and-potatoes environment.  Try adjusting it and you're more likely to get a good answer. :)	2017-09-07 06:12:09Z	DoctorWhom
13536	Adding on @DoctorWhom 's points, this question seems more related to Cooking.SE as it isn't about Health per se, but rather cooking in a foreign country.	2017-09-07 07:57:51Z	Narusan-in-coma

13509	Question - If the purpose of the Eustachian tube is to drain mucus out of the middle ear into the throat, how does it do that if the end of the tube is sealed tight by the ear drum?	2017-09-07 07:05:03Z	user11296
13509	More likely the same underlying cause resulted in the nasal congestion and the clogged Eustachian tubes.  For congestion some people find nasal irrigation helpful. // Separate from all that, if ear wax build-up is bothering you, there are gentle kits over-the-counter in the drug store, and also a doctor can help.	2017-09-10 06:43:57Z	aparente001

13500	Hi @z8080, welcome to Health.SE.  Thanks for reading about it, that's great that you looked into it!  We are in the process of narrowing down what medical advice is.  That meta is 2 yrs old, we should update it. Check this one here:  health.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/747/…	2017-09-03 21:52:49Z	DoctorWhom
13500	So let me help you.  Adding your experience makes it more like individualized advice. I proposed an edit that makes it more answerable for site guidelines.  You can revert it or edit it if you disagree!  See edit history for that.	2017-09-03 21:54:41Z	DoctorWhom
13500	@Narusan do you think this is an okay edit? Assuming the OP approves and doesn't revert it, I think this is answerable.	2017-09-04 08:16:55Z	DoctorWhom

13487	What the market will bear.	2017-09-02 03:10:40Z	Carey Gregory
13487	What @CareyGregory said, basically the answer to the question "Why does X medication cost so much?!" is related to how much the company thinks people will pay for it.  Want to make a fortune? Develop a medication, patent the formula so no one else can sell it, then charge any exorbitant amount you want until the patent runs out and other companies can make a generic version.  Even if it's a life-saving medication/formulation, there's no one regulating prices - at least not in the USA.  Plenty of examples in the last couple of years...	2017-09-04 08:21:38Z	DoctorWhom
13486	Also, while taking the specific antibiotic (Azithromycin) is it ok to use natural treatments like putting real aloe externally on the eyelid to help the cicatrization process? That or other methods are to avoid permanent scars that won't allow the patient to use contact lens.	2017-09-02 18:37:59Z	
13486	You need to ask an ophthalmologist for the latter questions.  "Natural" treatment means nothing, as everything that exists is a chemical of some sort, so other than aloe (which topically wouldn't interact with azithromycin but I have NO idea if it's okay to put it in your eyes!) it depends on the chemical whether it's safe for the eyes and whether azithro would interact.	2017-09-03 08:20:05Z	DoctorWhom
13484	Pls, it would help if you could show the website(s) where your research is based.	2017-08-31 23:09:19Z	Prince

13484	In my opinion, Tramadol is overprescribed and elderly patients should be weaned off it whenever possible.  Note, it has a relatively long half-life.	2017-09-10 06:21:15Z	aparente001
13480	I can imagine that it only works if it can target just adipose tissue cells, since there is fat in all cell membranes - most notably skin, for example.  I can't see how they can avoid the skin unless they insert a probe or something into the abdominal fat pad and cause the freezing around the probe.  Otherwise bringing tissues down to near freezing can cause general tissue damage to the skin around it...	2017-09-04 09:43:10Z	DoctorWhom
13480	@DoctorWhom First I would like to appreciate your attention to grammar. Most Whovians seem to struggle with it when referring to the topic of their affection. More on topic, from what I've gleaned about the procedure, it causes crystallization in the fat itself causing sufficient damage to cellular integrity as to trigger apoptosis. Because most cell membranes don't have anywhere near enough fat to cause this type of reaction, non-adipose tissues are apparently quite safe. In the CoolSculpting procedure, a pad is applied to the skin which transfers the cold, no probe needed. Make a difference?	2017-09-06 14:42:22Z	
13475	So you asked him and he wasn't able to explain why?  What did he actually say?  I know that there are some slightly different benefits depending on time of day, but regardless of the time walking is good for your health.  The ONLY minor thing I can think of is that people react differently to late evening/night exercise. For some people increases their energy levels and makes falling asleep harder. Others get tired after exercise and sleep better.  The elderly are more likely to suffer from sleep disturbances, so that's the only (rather thin) tie I can think of.	2017-08-31 07:57:30Z	DoctorWhom
13475	Can you develop a list of the potential benefits of walking, and then keep a log of your time of walk and observed results?	2017-09-01 05:40:48Z	aparente001
13475	I rarely walk, that is,  I rarely get any time to walk. So, I'll never be able to get those benefits till retirement :-)	2017-09-01 06:41:03Z	
13475	@DoctorWhom He said that his professor and books said so, and why they said so? That he didn't ask the professor or the books' authors. But I can assure you the books are not very good ones.	2017-09-02 15:38:31Z	
13475	Well it's an odd thing for him to say, but there are a lot of misinformation sources out there, and a lot of theories that aren't proven one way or another.  But yes, walking is good, period.  As for the "benefits of walking" and having to wait until retirement, one of the key parts of exercise is PREVENTING chronic disease development or progression. Actually you can even reverse or lessen the diseases and/or their consequences on your body by exercise and what you eat.  The earlier you start, the better.  It's better to prevent a heart attack than recover from one.	2017-09-04 08:15:52Z	DoctorWhom
13473	As you say that you are sometimes having difficulties in getting a lung full  of air even with unclogged nose, it seems a medical condition has arisen. You should consult an ENT specialist. Many a times, these can be cured by simple nasal sprays or regular nebulisation, which can be done at home. But as I'm not a doctor, I'll not recommend anything.	2017-08-31 03:36:50Z	Wrichik Basu
13473	See a primary care doctor or ENT specialist for this.  Nasal congestion is super common; there are multiple possible etiologies, and multiple successful treatments.  We can't give medical advice here; see Meta for reasons why.	2017-08-31 08:02:34Z	DoctorWhom
13473	Use a saline spray several times a day.  Don't pick, as picking will favor the formation of crusts.  You'll need to find some alternate things to fidget with for the duration, and on a temporary basis you may need to put some bandaids across the nostrils to deter the habit.	2017-09-01 05:42:32Z	aparente001
13473	@aparente001 My grandmother suggested using salt water to clean things out. I asked if I could skip the whole water thing and go straight to snorting lines of salt. Apparently that is not so good for your health :/ but frequent nasal spray would be a better choice	2017-09-01 13:14:02Z

13469	In general, having a normal CBC is a good thing, and repeated normal tests is reassuring. To know whether that says anything about your aches and pains or not, you need a doctor to review your results and interpret them for you in the setting of your medical history	2017-08-30 15:51:20Z	DoctorWhom
13469	What do you think about the stability of repeated test in  9 months ?	2017-08-30 20:25:29Z	
13469	Stability generally is a good thing but no one can interpret results out of context, only a doctor who has your full picture can interpret those.  Read this: health.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/747/…	2017-08-30 20:37:59Z	DoctorWhom
13469	The CBC might not be a useful test to figure out the specific symptoms being experienced.  The similarity in the results over time suggests that the factors being measured do not have much variability in this individual at this time.	2017-09-01 05:45:47Z	aparente001

13462	Hi @Kasif, welcome.    Your question is way too broad.  There are MANY fungal diseases, from athlete's foot and thrush to mucormycosis that invades the brain.  They are caused by different kinds of fungus under different conditions and are treated by different types of anti-fungal medications.  Please narrow your question, as it is it's too broad to answer!	2017-08-30 07:48:06Z	DoctorWhom
13462	I agree with DoctorWhom, if you could be a little bit more specific as to the type of fungal disease you have in mind, it could really help a lot...but if such changes are not made, I'm afraid the question will have to be closed as it is just way too broad.	2017-08-31 23:17:15Z	Prince
13461	Yes and you need to see a doctor. There are conditions (e.g. DI, DM) that can cause your body to not be able to hold onto water and become dangerously dehydrated.  Having neurological symptoms like dizziness and tunnel vision is nothing to mess with!  There are other conditions (also potentially quite serious) that cause extra thirst and your dizziness etc might be related to having TOO MUCH extra water in your body (e.g. hyponatremia).  Also quite bad.  It's impossible for anyone here to tell you which.  See a doctor!	2017-08-30 08:26:09Z	DoctorWhom
13461	Your symptom might be caused by something other than dehydration.  There are other situations in which sipping water can be helpful. // Do see a doctor.  There can be fairly simple explanations of things, and practical advice to help you feel better.	2017-09-01 05:48:32Z	aparente001
13459	Welcome to Health.SE. We can't do personal medical advice and I have thus removed personal medical information that is irrelevant and would only make the question off-topic. Furthermore, your title and the last section of the question differed. I suspected that you want to know whether your current medication is responsible for your low libido. We usually don't discuss treatments here and questions regarding the clinic you included in the original posts should be primarily taken to the clinic itself or a doctor of your choice. Otherwise, you can opt to ask another question.	2017-08-29 10:54:28Z	Narusan-in-coma
13459	[cont'd] Feel free to edit the question yourself or revert my edit if you do not agree with it. // It would also be helpful if you could provide information about the size of the tablet and whether this is daily intake or else.	2017-08-29 10:55:37Z	Narusan-in-coma

13448	This is a good question, though I would refine the last sentence to define what you mean by cognitive development - if you want specifically disorders similar to dyslexia, then it's an easier to answer question, whereas general cognitive development is vast.  But I actually think you have a higher likelihood of receiving replies at CogSci SE.  Might check them out!	2017-08-27 00:52:45Z	DoctorWhom
13448	That description on GTA is not really accurate though. You don't "gain scores" by performing those actions, especially not by having sex with a prostitute. It's not even clear what you mean by "scores". I'm not sure if you have played the game yourself. Also, GTA as a whole is really intended as a (brilliant) satire of the American society, but of course the kids with their knowledge might be unable to perceive that and take in some of the elements of the game at their face value, which might be bad.	2017-08-30 22:16:03Z	JI Xiang
13448	But yeah, this might be a complicated subject. Some studies suggested that some games would actually help cognitive development as well as serve as some kind of treatment for cognitive disorders. But some other studies are negative. Anyways, I don't think dyslexia would be a particular concern in terms of games. Gaming is so widespread but kids nowadays don't suddenly become more dyslexic than kids before. People I know who gamed a lot growing up still studied very well, got top grades and got admitted to top universities. Dyslexia probably has causes other than gaming.	2017-08-30 22:16:05Z	JI Xiang
13448	If games are so bad and demonic as some conservatives like to make them out to be then they'd have long evoked much greater backlash from the parents and be banned, etc. This has not happened. I don't think they're fundamentally different from forms of entertainment of previous eras such as outdoor games, chess or TV either. It's just entertainment in a new form. The older generation also panicked a lot when TV first came out. I think the generation growing up watching TV turned out just fine.	2017-08-30 22:21:48Z	JI Xiang
13448	Another factor why it might not have much to do with dyslexia is that actually if you have played some AAA games you'd know well that there's actually much more reading involved in those games than in say TVs and movies, where there's literally zero reading or active participation required on the viewer's part. Games are not like that. They require the player to actively solve challenges most of the time, albeit admittedly relatively shallow/casual ones.	2017-08-30 22:35:29Z	JI Xiang
13441	I edited the question to move it out of the gray zone of individual diagnosis.  You ask a very interesting question about strength of correlation and whether you can exclude other conditions based on that association.  If you dislike my edit and feel it changed your question, please revert it. Check out this Meta for reasons why we can't give individual advice, if that was your intent for asking.

13438	I cannot fully answer this as I don't know of studies that directly link them.

13438	@threetimes even well-intended as it is, your advice is toward the top of the slippery slope of recommending treatment.  If the question were completely devoid of personal advice (clinical information) then a variation on your question would be appropriate, especially with the paper cited.	2017-08-26 07:09:32Z	DoctorWhom
13438	@Sunny welcome to SE! This question is presenting lab values and symptoms, thoughts on what diagnoses you might have, and is asking for information and treatment recommendations.

13438	If you rephrase your entire question to ask the underlying question whether there is evidence for ways that autoimmune-related hypothyroidism conditions can be reversed in any way, rather than relying on lifelong thyroid supplementation, then your question could be answered.

13434	Welcome droidnation!  This is a personal advice question, specifically a second opinion type.  Check out this meta about why we can't answer medical advice questions on HealthSE.  If you want an answer, you will need to restructure the question to be JUST THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY QUESTION with background information about the topic, nothing about personal experience.	2017-08-26 07:16:39Z	DoctorWhom
13434	There is no way for anyone here to know what her doctors' clinical rationale was for the approach they took to her medical diagnosis.  This question is unanswerable as it is. And yes, you are blaming them, your statement indicates you feel they did the wrong thing. If you restructure it to ask why blood and MRI testing for cancers aren't automatically done when someone has severe anemia, and you present information (with a resource you cite) about how severe anemia is a sign of cancer, then that could be answered. Then I will retract the close vote and downvote.  Cheers!	2017-08-26 07:24:02Z	DoctorWhom
13427	Has she seen a doctor that has evaluated her for anxiety?  You say they are saying her heart is fine, but it's possible to have very scary heart related symptoms from anxiety and for some people this become pronounced only at night, or even waking them from sleep feeling terrible.	2017-08-25 20:10:31Z	threetimes

13427	If you're not sure if she's reporting accurately what the doctor said, you could ask if you could go with her to an appointment. // I wonder if she's eating too much too late in the day and experiencing heartburn (indigestion).	2017-09-01 06:03:38Z	aparente001
13425	Welcome @user11199!  It is a good question but there are a few issues.  One, it's a request for medical advice; this explains why we cannot give that here..  This can be fixed by removing ALL clinical history and asking the fundamental pathophysiology question.  (2) It is very broad with multiple questions, making it dificult to answer.  I can offer to edit it for you, and you can revert it if you dislike it.	2017-08-26 06:40:25Z	DoctorWhom

13418	You answered your own question. Depending on the type of fasting you're commuting to is the determining factor. If you're juice fasting, your body can still absorb and adapt to the diet. If you're simply not eating, you will not have proper proteins and amino acids to aid in healing. Factors such as lifestyle and health problems will contribute. Simple fact of the matter is that without nutrients or enough of them, your body will be hindered in many ways. You don't need research to understand that. To figure out EXACTLY what happens would require clinical research on multiple cases.	2017-08-23 13:42:46Z	cloudnyn3
13418	I have to edit your post in order to reverse my downvote. (It’s locked).

13407	The answer is correct, there is no special soap for penis. It's nearly impossible to tell about the "white dots" without more details: when did they appear? Did you do something before the appeared? Where exactly are they located? Does it hurt when touching them? And more.	2017-08-22 12:48:00Z	Shadow Wizard
13407	@ShadowWizard Totally agree. I answered on the assumption that the white dots were on the outside skin of the penis. Otherwise, soap will most likely not do any harm, but it will sting and burn a bit. In any case, see a dermatologist if the white dots keep recurring	2017-08-22 14:07:29Z	Narusan-in-coma
13407	About the white dots, have a look at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsuties_coronae_glandis (caution, possible NSFW image)	2017-08-22 17:53:42Z	Marc Ranolfi
13407	The OP has "white dots" on his penis and everyone's talking about soap? WTF....	2017-08-23 03:59:35Z	Carey Gregory
13407	If the soap stings, it's the wrong soap.  If the soap doesn't sting, you chose well.  Are you talking about the smegma that accumulates under the foreskin?  Gentle retraction while washing will help in that case.  However, a visit to your regular doctor would allow you to rule out a condition that would require medical treatment.  Don't worry about making this visit.  Doctors are used to examining genitals and diagnosing various conditions.	2017-09-01 06:13:16Z	aparente001
13403	It is not a well known "Fact" that 2500. Is "considered" to suffice for an average man per day. However, how exactly your body receives these calories is a determining factor. A man could live on 1000 per day. However if it's only from McDonalds cheese burgers, the proper nutrients will not be delivered. There are also few studies on this due to the fact that we didn't have modern medicine and studies centuries ago. This is something that needs to be studied. Unfortunately the amount of variables that come into play hinder that greatly.	2017-08-21 23:01:38Z	cloudnyn3

13402	Alcohol can obviously be detected in your blood. It depends on local legislation whether your health provider is allowed to give out any information to officials (in Germany, they are not unless the police requests such a test). Depending on the amount of drugs/partying, that might render your blood test results pretty unusuable.	2017-08-21 16:26:01Z	Narusan-in-coma
13402	Thanks for the answer! And if i only consume weed? Can it be detected?	2017-08-21 16:42:36Z

13397	Love the question.  I have participated a little in the Human Dx Project that is doing the latter (fine tuning), and there's Watson.  AI-assisted diagnosing is, I think, on the not too distant frontier.  Inputting symptoms does exist as well.  I wish there was ONE central location though.	2017-08-21 04:42:33Z	DoctorWhom

13386	Like any other medicine, the effectiveness of any treatment will need to be studied per illness.  You list two here.  Even in those two, studies on cancer treatment will look a specific type of cancer (breast, lung, colon, etc).  I do not think many things have been studied at all if there isn't a drug they are looking to use.  There are studies where Ayurveda is lumped in with all alternative therapies, but that isn't very helpful.	2017-08-20 19:42:09Z	threetimes
13384	Please take a moment to google your question.  The definition of venous leak is right there.  If you are asking how it works/how it happens, that needs to be clarified in your question.

So in your Q (1) define venous leak and (2) explain what you specifically want to understand about it.	2017-08-20 07:01:08Z	DoctorWhom

13376	I don't flag comments often but giving someone advice to stop a blood thinner CAN BE FATAL ADVICE @Charlie .  What are your qualifications for giving that information?  Warfarin is safely used ALL THE TIME for DVTs, PEs, and other blood clotting issues.  There is strong evidence for efficacy.  And yes there are other anticoagulants than warfarin as well.  To the OP, if you want additional options, tell your doctor you want to know more options, but DO NOT change it yourself.	2017-08-20 08:14:30Z	DoctorWhom
13376	Warfarin needs to be monitored regularly by your doctor's office.  As it's a Vitamin K antagonist, eating foods high in Vitamin K reduce its effect.  mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thrombophlebitis/… BUT I am not aware of citrus being an issue.  Also, +1 to @CareyGregory's comments.	2017-08-20 08:19:17Z	DoctorWhom

13365	People with asthma are advised to vacuum their houses at least once a day, while living in a sterile environment has been linked to the development of allergies. So there are known health aspects to cleaning.	2017-08-19 00:41:03Z	Count Iblis
13365	Cleanliness is related to hygiene and disease prevention. (As the tag “hygiene” on this very web site indicates, and as the comment by @Count Iblis illustrates.) Can you explain how you reach the conclusion that my question has nothing to do with health? Maybe I should rephrase something, if it is unclear?	2017-08-19 07:34:37Z	
13365	I agree with @CountIblis. You might state something like: "For some conditions, frequently cleaning is advised, such as vacuuming for asthma or washing sheets on hot water for allergic rhintiis.  Other conditions are thought to be associated with environments that are too sterile.  Is there an evidence-based recommendation for "how clean" one's home environment should be?"  I realize this is a broad question but at least the root of it could be answered reasonably concisely.	2017-08-19 09:14:32Z	DoctorWhom
13365	One could talk about not cleaning showers or damp areas that can lead to mold, and there are some molds that can cause allergies or even (rarely) lung inflammation.  Usually that's when in larger quantities like water damaged furniture.  And that scrubbing with bleach kills even the spores but if you clean more regularly it won't build up in the first place...	2017-08-19 09:17:40Z	DoctorWhom
13364	Welcome to Health. We cannot give you personal medical advise for many reasons, but we can help you rephrase your question to make it more general and thus adhere to the scope if that is in your interest.	2017-08-18 14:37:17Z	Narusan-in-coma
13364	@Narusan Thanks. Please do.	2017-08-18 14:53:12Z	
13364	The trouble is that to rephrase it one would have to change so much, that the system won't let me do it, only the OP (the owner of the post). If you ask what causes vertigo and how it can be dealt with without invoking personal information.	2017-08-18 14:58:51Z	Narusan-in-coma
13364	It's a request for a diagnosis that we couldn't provide even if we wanted to. She needs to see a physician. I don't see any way to salvage it so voting to close.	2017-08-18 19:58:36Z	Carey Gregory
13364	The doctor has to investigate, but it's good to keep in mind that the most likely cause is this, which is not serious. This is not a substitute to go to the doctor, just to not be a priori stressed out about this. The doctor has to be consulted because there is always the possibility that a complaint like this does turn out to be a more serious problem, but what you don't want to do is make that assumption right from the start.	2017-08-18 22:45:14Z	Count Iblis
13409	I suspect a big part of this effect is just placebo. Many people who do not drink coffee and do not smoke have bowel movements in the morning, basically after some time of being awake and up. If for some this time is around the time they need for coffee and a smoke, then they connect this (not necessarily correctly). And then they can use this to their advantage in case they need a bowel movement. Or maybe also, in case they want to delay it.	2017-08-18 11:58:55Z	skymningen
13409	@skymningen Yeah, I also considered the option that it's failure in my observation. This is why I came here for scientific answer.	2017-08-18 12:11:48Z	
13409	I'd prefer it if people used either technical terms, "bowel movements", or standard Anglo-Saxon, "shitting". Childish euphemisms for normal bodily functions send me up the wall.	2017-08-18 20:38:37Z	
13409	What's wrong with saying poop? That's not a childish euphemism. It's a real word.	2017-08-21 13:27:59Z	
13409	@Remi.b This is not a bad question, and does not depend simply on human health. There is a very simple biological answer here and I'm not sure why this has received so much negativity. We shouldn't close things just because they could also be on topic at health.SE, per meta.	2017-08-21 14:49:30Z	Bryan Krause
13363	You mean if they inhale it?  And you mean completely cut off airway?  I'd go ahead and edit the question to be clearer and instead use "What size must an object be to cause complete airway obstruction?"  Commonly things like peanuts get stuck in a bronchus so only 1 lung gets blocked, and then often partially. But if you're talking about 100% blockage, that's your trachea or larynx.  Unless you're talking about choking someone's neck from the outside.  That's a different question, one I'm hoping you're not asking.	2017-08-19 09:20:16Z	DoctorWhom

But realize that you already have some symptoms including depression, anhedonia, thin despite eating a lot, maybe fatigue.  Sedentary behavior and depression can make a vicious cycle. There's a lot of research on sedentary lifestyle and inflammation including cardiovascular disease, blood pressure, diabetes, and other conditions in the long run.  See a doctor about the depression at the very least, but make a list of your symptoms, medical history, what you eat, and take it with you with a list of questions.	2017-08-16 10:54:53Z	DoctorWhom

13290	You need a dermatologist for this inflammation.  They may recommend an allergist if you're having cutaneous manifestations when you eat certain foods.  But if this is inflammatory acne, a dermatologist should see it.  Also, you need to balance your diet - there are skin manifestations of vitamin/mineral deficiencies too!  You're eating almost no fruits or vegetables which, sorry, your body needs.  There are all sorts of ways to make fruits and vegetables palatable such as blenders, sauces...	2017-08-15 07:32:32Z	DoctorWhom

13286	Welcome to HealthSE.  We can't give medical advice here - please take a look at the site guidelines.  Irregular periods can be normal or abnormal.  There are several factors to take into consideration.  A doctor can walk you through the options. I don't know what you mean by "proper treatment."	2017-08-12 09:41:57Z	DoctorWhom
13281	This is probably something you should be discussing with your doctor. Regarding your question, it is very personal in my eyes and likely to get closed. Is it possible to make it more general (i.e. remove the personal background and changing from will I to will one. I have proposed an edit.	2017-08-11 20:13:44Z	Narusan-in-coma

13280	Welcome @Luis!  I like the question, could you include a link to resource showing that it is the case so people looking to answer can look at the data?	2017-08-12 04:53:24Z	DoctorWhom
13279	Interesting question.  Clinically, yes it happens.  But I actually don't know how that works neurologically and am curious to see if there is an answer.	2017-08-12 09:47:36Z	DoctorWhom
13279	Thanks for the comment. I was thinking about asking this on Biology, but the boyz on biology are sensitive, they don't like questions like this.	2017-08-12 09:53:20Z	
13279	There is a fine line for sure in terms of scope, often blurry.  But BioSE is a good goal for a well-functioning site, I'd love to see us get there!	2017-08-12 09:55:26Z	DoctorWhom

13271	I had both the flu, cold and fever and never had a blood test conducted on me. This might depend on country regulations, culture and training of the doctor.

13268	Welcome Vitalis.  This opinion-based question could perhaps be better addressed in PhilosophySE.  Your question is full of assumptions with differing degrees of accuracy.  There are all sorts of issues you're not taking into consideration, and your question title doesn't seem to be what you're asking in teh question.	2017-08-10 11:34:38Z	DoctorWhom
13268	@DoctorWhom Great reply. But I have to disagree. Feel free to address the issues I am not taking into consideration and I am willing to rephrase the question.	2017-08-10 11:39:05Z	
13268	First, your title is a potential question for HealthSE, but the body of text is not on topic for HealthSE.  This isn't a place to rant, either. And as someone who has done research and seen a ton of the pros/cons of it, there are more issues than can be discussed in this comments section.  Stack Exchange is not like other Q&A sites, check out some of the guides for more info	2017-08-10 11:48:49Z	DoctorWhom
13268	If your actual question is how can a person contribute without getting into the field themselves, or giving money, that might be on topic here.  But the rest of it isn't.	2017-08-10 11:49:50Z	DoctorWhom
13268	One thing I want to correct based on your post before the (good) edits. The scientists who do the actual work of discovering drugs and treatments rarely drive Porsches because they are rarely wealthy. They can no more afford a pay cut than you can. Modern drugs are rarely, if ever, created by an individual or two. They are the product of hundreds of scientists and technicians, virtually none of whom are wealthy. Don't confuse scientists with pharmaceutical corporations and their executives.	2017-08-10 17:49:12Z	Carey Gregory
13262	Welcome user!  There are several different issues going on here in your question.  First, we can't give medical advice, so I'm editing it. Second, your protein intake is pretty extreme, you should probably have a dietician advising you if you're going that route.  There is actual evidence for what you do and do not need for muscle building, which you might benefit from learning.	2017-08-10 11:38:32Z	DoctorWhom
13259	Without having any expertise or conducting research in this area, I'd say no. My parents do have glasses, and so do I, but my vision is a lot better. This is more likely to be the case because myopia et al. is diagnosed earlier and treated earlier, and therefore eyesight doesn't decrease as quickly. I suppose that something similar might be the case with your Szenario as well. Correlation, not causation.	2017-08-09 21:38:27Z	Narusan-in-coma
13259	+! for correlation not causation statement.  Actually I meant +1 but the ! does appropriately relay my sentiments in seeing you say that, so I'll keep it.	2017-08-10 07:08:04Z	DoctorWhom
13252	Welcome to HealthSE.  Part of the rules of Stack Exchange include demonstrating what you've learned trying to answer your own question and formulate a question based on where you're stumped.  This rule is no different from basically all SE sites, including StackOverflow, so I'm not sure why you would choose not to put any effort into it on Health SE. ESPECIALLY because it's in Beta we try to be vigilant about quality control. Downvoted for effort; please at least Google it before editing your question, then I can remove the downvote.	2017-08-09 05:00:50Z	DoctorWhom
13252	Also, what prompted you to think there was an association?	2017-08-09 09:47:05Z	DoctorWhom
13252	@DoctorWhom Short questions tend to get short answers....	2017-08-09 10:56:24Z	Narusan-in-coma
13252	@DoctorWhom Yes I see how that would be useful for SO community to prevent people asking questions like "how do I make Facebook?".  In my opinion, other SE sites should loosen up the rules a little. It can be very intimidating asking the question that would satisfy all the guidelines. This is a QnA site after all, I come here to exercise my curiosity and ask questions. Instead get flagged and down voted. It is quite off-putting, because the whole community seems to be very snobby instead of welcoming. (In my personal experience)	2017-08-09 11:33:22Z	
13252	I get how you feel, and felt the same way at the beginning. I started on other SE sites.  But Health isn't a typical Q&A site. If you scroll through the questions history you'll see numerous questions that are unanswerable for a variety of reasons, or repeatedly-duplicated (didn't look for previous SE answers first), unfounded (didn't try to read first), and "diagnose this."  Trying to establish standards means asking participants to put in effort.  Otherwise we have lots of questions without answers, diluting the pool, discouraging those who might answer questions.	2017-08-09 11:51:10Z	DoctorWhom
13251	TBH I have no idea what foods could do that, so I can't answer this.  But I do need to mention that erections that either (1) last longer than 4 hours or (2) are painful should be evaluated by a physician, ASAP. Priapism can be a medical emergency.	2017-08-09 05:35:54Z	DoctorWhom
13251	The fact that you say "much of the day after" makes me concerned for the duration of these erections.  That might actually warrant seeing a doctor, IMHO.  Just because you've noticed it correlating with Indian food doesn't mean it is related to the food at all, it might be a coincidence - and be another issue entirely.  Correlation does not imply causation!	2017-08-09 05:36:34Z	DoctorWhom
13251	If you suspect a certain food to cause it, stop eating it for a while and see what happens. You also didn't mention if you are taking certain drugs. See this source and this source for a partial list of drugs that can cause priapism.	2017-08-22 05:02:39Z	Don_S

13239	Go multiple times during the day in short bursts. You need that mental rest to digest information and exercise will boost your blood flow to help with it. (been in the same situation)	2017-08-09 11:43:25Z	Ruslan
13239	Thanks for contributing, I can definitely see you want to help people with their health concerns.  But this is another example of health advice without showing its evidence base (if there is any).  You're giving anecdotal experiences and advice without a source for someone to be able to evaluate whether it's legit or not.  That's not how HealthSE works.	2017-08-10 11:54:08Z	DoctorWhom
13239	thank you for contributing Ruslan, its clear DoctorWhom doesn't want me the get any response	2017-12-17 21:45:34Z	
13238	Wow, very broad, probably too broad. You can't just ask things like what happens when someone arrives in an ambulance because the answer depends on what's wrong with them. Obviously, a stabbing victim and a heart attack will follow vastly different paths. There are about 5000 other "common scenarios" you haven't thought about. They can be categorized to make it simpler (trauma, cardiology, respiratory, OB/gyn, etc), but there are still a lot of categories. I think you need to rethink this question, and perhaps your whole approach.	2017-08-09 00:07:50Z	Carey Gregory
13238	Also, what kind of software, and to what clinical staff?  The charting of different roles (e.g. RN vs MD) is quite different.  Carey is right that there are many different paths of patient flow (also called clinical flow) through A&E (called ED or ER in the US).	2017-08-09 05:09:16Z	DoctorWhom
13234	Vegetables! I'd also look into whether or not you're insensitive to certain foods (I think a blood test can determine this)	2017-08-07 21:27:27Z	Mark C.
13233	This has all the signs of indirectly asking for medical advice, but I'd like to imagine this is a healthcare provider asking colleagues to discuss the difference between protrusion or extrusion in this case, so because the answer is good, I'm voting to keep it.  But please do not take answers as medical advice.  If this is you or someone you know, have a doctor look at it.	2017-08-10 11:23:46Z	DoctorWhom

13229	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because the OP made an assumption ("we always get headaches") without linking to studies, numbers or other sources for the claim and it is unclear for us whether an explanation for headaches after crying is expected (i.e. if crying can cause headaches) or why headaches are an imminent response to crying (which I can negate from personal experience).	2017-08-07 18:42:47Z	Narusan-in-coma
13227	As written, your question was off topic here. We don't provide recommendations or advice. So I edited it to make it an actual health question. If you dislike my edit you can revert it, but that will likely result in your question being closed as off topic.	2017-08-04 23:28:20Z	Carey Gregory
13227	Definitely better, but perhaps could be edited further since ergonomic chairs can help improve posture if properly used; I think the fundamental question is whether improving posture could affect sleep apnea.  @Chris is that what you mean?	2017-08-06 09:54:56Z	DoctorWhom

13217	It is important to note that people tend to have different responses to thyroid hormone supplementation, requiring different quantities depending on multiple factors, so I'm not sure there's a reliable correlation between dosage and serum T4 measurements.	2017-08-04 06:57:12Z	DoctorWhom
13200	Your question is rather borderline off topic, but it's not clearly off topic so I'm going to answer it even though I'll probably get downvoted because I can't think of any sources to cite to support my answer.	2017-08-03 01:11:09Z	Carey Gregory
13200	you don't mention where you live, I'm guessing the USA. In Ontario walk-in clinics will order tests and ask you to come back the next time that doctor is working a shift so you can discuss results and next steps. It's awkward but does sort of work.	2017-08-03 13:52:06Z	Kate Gregory

13190	Appendectomies have virtually no impact on the cost of health care in the US. I really can't imagine where you got that idea. And appendicitis is virtually never treated solely with antibiotics. An inflamed appendix will eventually burst and cause peritonitis, which can be fatal. You need a new source of stuff you know.	2017-08-01 17:17:30Z	Carey Gregory
13190	Ditto the above comments.  However, I do appreciate your improvement thought process and curiosity about whether it is feasible.

13153	I'm sure there are but this is a question for his doctor. You can't just call up a prosthetics company and order new feet. Fitting prosthetics is a complex procedure requiring a physician with experience in that area.	2017-07-29 23:10:42Z	Carey Gregory

13153	The technology exists. No question about that, and a doctor qualified to do such fittings will know who they are. If his doctor doesn't know the answer to this question then you need to find a specialist in this area who does. As I said, you can't just call up a company and order new feet.	2017-07-29 23:19:13Z	Carey Gregory

13151	No, I am not. We expect a certain degree of effort before a question is asked here. Cancer as a disease doesn't exist. Cancer is the excessive replication of mutated DNA. The body has mechanisms to detect mutated DNA which fail when it comes to cancer. As every cancer is different, it is currently not a treatment option to identify mutated DNA. Even if identified, the cancerous molecules would still need to be taken out of the body. Future cancer treatments will limit the replication of damaged DNA and future some sort of molecules (or nanobot) to extract damages DNA or even damaged cells from	2017-07-29 19:20:10Z	Narusan-in-coma
13151	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because OP has only little understanding of cancer and asks question based on false assumptions. An answer to this question would have to explain what cancer is and talk about treatments. This is too extensive for a single question.	2017-07-29 21:44:34Z	Narusan-in-coma

13129	I think you misunderstood them. Your wife wasn't infected by the test. The sample was contaminated, which sometimes happens. Most likely the tech or nurse who drew the sample wasn't as careful with their sterile technique as they should have been. However, you're asking us for medical advice and that's strictly off topic here, so I'm voting to close. I think you can rest assured your wife does not have sepsis.	2017-07-27 19:40:37Z	Carey Gregory
13129	@CareyGregory I'm not asking for medical advice at all, in the "What should I do" sense. I'm asking if it's normal for bacteria to survive the sanitizing wipe and enter the blood. Does this indicate a serious breach of procedures by the nurse, or is it something that just happens sometimes? I appreciate the comment though, it answers some questions. My wife said the nurse herself mentioned sepsis, but the details are unclear.	2017-07-28 16:23:01Z	
13129	Asking us to judge how serious the situation is, is asking for medical advice. If you edit your question to remove all the personal anecdote and boil it down to the question you just outlined, it should be fine and I'll retract my close vote.	2017-07-28 18:43:23Z	Carey Gregory
13129	@CareyGregory I think there's some misunderstanding here. I'm not asking whether there's a serious risk to my wife's health. I'm asking if the contaminated blood indicates a serious breach of protocol by the hospital staff. This could be blood drawn from a blood bag for all it matters. The anecdote is there merely to establish context. I'll edit my question to make it clear.	2017-07-28 22:05:24Z

13103	No heroin in Brazil? That's funny because it has a street price havocscope.com/tag/brazil	2017-07-26 23:10:10Z	Carey Gregory
13103	"accessible without medical prescription" - so are you excluding buying opiate meds on the street?	2017-07-27 00:21:22Z	Mark D Worthen PsyD
13103	@MarkDWorthenPsyD, I'm lawyer in Brazil, so I know a little bit about the "illegal drugs underworld" here, and, there's no opiate meds on the street here... but, you make a point, it's possible to find a pharmacy that deals it illegaly - however, it's hard to find.	2017-07-27 22:45:18Z	
13103	@CareyGregory, I never saw heroin here. In 2015 two Africans were arrested here with it, but it was something extraordinary (they bring it from Africa) - Even though Colombian cartels try to cultivate it, mainly it comes from the Asia, and go to Europe and to North America... but, sure enough, in Brazil you will find, normally, only cocaine, crack-cocaine and marijuana... heroin is just like a unicorn here... and in the 90's it was even more rare.	2017-07-27 22:57:44Z	
13103	It's not cultivated in the US or Europe either but they're inundated with it. I find it very surprising that it's rare or nonexistent in Brazil, or any country really other than totalitarian regimes.	2017-07-28 00:25:41Z	Carey Gregory

For example, if I asked who are some of the world's greatest experts in elliptic curves, one would not be wrong to mention names like Manjul Bhargava and Serge Lang, as these are people who have published extensively on this topic and received recognition for their work. Your comment seems to be attempting to shut down what I view as a very valid and legitimate question.

13086	I understand that you didn't revert the whole edit, and you left out the most problematic parts, but still there is too much personal detail and the question gets close to personal medical advice question.

13078	Wow! Thanks for this question because I have often wondered the same thing!! Did they figure out better solutions to treating ailments associated with tonsillitis? Realize the benefits of tonsils? I'm not sure why it is supposedly less common, but I had my tonsils removed like 3 years ago when I was 24..... (because I kept getting sore throats). I remember thinking, "they still do this?" It's a lot more painful to get a tonsillectomy as an adult. See my question here: health.stackexchange.com/questions/9639/…	2017-07-24 17:28:30Z	Pills N Pillows

13078	Interesting question. I had a number of bouts of tonsillitis as a child in the early 1960s, and I came close to having them taken out, but it never happened because I stopped having tonsillitis. My two older sisters, however, both had them out and they had fewer episodes than I did. So it seems the change in thinking was at least beginning to occur by the early 60s.	2017-07-24 23:30:34Z	Carey Gregory
13078	The simplified version is that alternative short-term treatments got better, and long-term studies showed that the long-term benefits mostly didn't exist.  Still looking for sources.	2017-07-25 20:49:10Z	Mark
13077	The medical term for this condition is, Panniculus. You can read about it here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panniculus. But to save your time it means, "a dense layer of fatty tissue growth, consisting of subcutaneous fat in the lower abdominal area. It can be a result of obesity and can be mistaken for a tumor or hernia. Abdominal panniculus can be removed during abdominal panniculectomy, a type of abdominoplasty. A panniculus can also be the result of loose tissues after pregnancy or massive weight loss."

That could be googled to give you starting information to use when asking this question.  Or is the question whether just tomatoes and vegetables for breakfast is sufficient nutrition?  That depends on how much and what you're eating - and there are many schools of thought on breakfast nutrition.	2017-07-26 06:56:24Z	DoctorWhom

13046	These nutritional questions usually get no answer because it is difficult to answer them. No study with a significant number of participants has been done to test the healthiness of eating cherry tomatoes daily. The only thing we can do is check whether substances none to cause health issues are present in a cherry tomato and whether they are present in a multitude that would actually impose a risk.

13029	I can understand why you would give clinical background, thinking it helps people answer it better, but that is a common mistake - once you provide a clinical story/background, it becomes medical advice. That's basically the beginning of a clinical visit, and we go down the rabbit hole of potential misdiagnosis and mismanagement. It can be downright dangerous.

12979	It's theorized that the brain releases large amounts of Dimethyltryptamine which slows downs time and gives the person in question vivid hallucinations and great feelings of spirituality while dying.

That means [condoms: used correctly][1], stored correctly, before expiration, no breakage.  But that only protects your penis, of course.  There's a lot more skin contact down there that occurs. Whether someone has told you she's had 0 partners or 1000, you have no way of knowing what she has contracted (tests aren't even 100% accurate). Gonorrhea? Syphilis? Herpes? HIV?

12965	The question is getting close-votes because the answer to "what do you expect the doctor will do" may be used to do the same thing without the doctor - which is dangerous. You already have some questions. You may also want to know about the risks and benefits - not just in a general case, but in your father's case as well, since every person is different and your doctor has insight into his case. If you are not satisfied with the answer, the only thing we can recommend is getting a second medical opinion.	2017-07-26 18:02:59Z	Lucky

Define undermethylation using a strong resource.  2. it's better to ask what data supports it rather than asking if something is legit.  3. show examples of the information you found on it to give a starting point.  Welcome :)	2017-07-15 04:15:01Z	DoctorWhom
12962	Health SE in general does not often discuss alternative medicine topics.  Some have large amounts of strong evidence supporting them, others do not, and there are a lot of strong opinions on all sides.  Look at this meta: health.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/95/…	2017-07-15 04:19:31Z	DoctorWhom
12962	Well, are we sure that it IS alternative medicine (as opposed to mainstream)? That's part of my question.	2017-07-15 04:45:22Z	
12960	Can you link to the source stating that it can lead to rapid deterioration? That would give us a hint what to look for. Everything can lead to deterioration if not applied properly...	2017-07-14 17:22:59Z	Narusan-in-coma

12960	If you're going to ask a question like this, give the context and what you've learned so far in your attempt to answer the question yourself.  Give citations that can be accessed by readers.  It is a good question, but not properly asked according to Health SE rules.  Edit it a bit.	2017-07-15 04:21:31Z	DoctorWhom
12958	Did he have a sex drive previously and has lost it? Also, does he want to have a sex drive?	2017-07-14 16:25:19Z	Narusan-in-coma
12958	Go to a doctor.  There are many possible causes for a lack of sex drive, some of which can be treated by medicines and some of which can't, and sometimes a medicine that can cure one cause will make a different cause worse.	2017-07-14 22:51:42Z	Mark

12925	Although anxiety is a possible cause (as the person who answered stated), and heart problems and strokes are rare in younger people - they still do happen and can be triggered by anxiety. Yyour symptoms should be evaluated by a medical professional.  Rules of HealthSE do not permit personal health advice questions and should not be answered as such.  It is dangerous to diagnose you online.  I recommend being seen by a primary care physician for a same-day visit, or go to an urgent care or ER.  If you are weak, don't drive yourself, and consider calling 911.	2017-07-13 06:00:49Z	DoctorWhom

12913	Ahem. Every death is eventually a stop of the heart and oxygen deprivation. Blood loss leads to that, brain death tends to, heart strokes do. Interesting is why the heart stops.	2017-07-11 13:59:07Z	Narusan-in-coma
12913	@Narusan Well, fair, aside from some poisonings or major brain trauma, etc.  I feel like most other initial causes of death are not as easily reversible as "they are cold", though; my understanding is that they'll try to keep blood in you and your heart pumping while they try to fix a knife wound.  So after a fashion, part of the question is, "are there any irreversible changes that being cold causes, that do not stem from the heart stopping"?	2017-07-11 19:37:48Z

12912	@KateGregory It doesn't matter in this case because OPs requesting examples (as I understand it). A case study would suffice, or just nothing at all.	2017-07-26 20:48:33Z	Narusan-in-coma
12911	I don't get what you want from us... Usually they know what they do and wouldn't let you with an untreated tumor. Apart from that, where did you get the idea that a tumor in your lungs will make you cough? To me it seems you just visit as many doctors as possible until someone tells you that you do have a tumor. From what I have read here, these are not classic symptoms for tumors .	2017-07-11 13:54:29Z	Narusan-in-coma
12911	Actually, it is a request for medical advice. You're asking us to either confirm or overrule two doctors who have examined you, and that makes the question off topic.	2017-07-11 14:51:30Z	Carey Gregory
12911	I know my doctors are right. But how do I stop being nervous. That's my question.	2017-07-11 14:58:04Z

12904	Whenever someone says something is 100% efficient (or effective) it is untrue (well most of the time :P)  It is a sign someone is over selling something. And if they are having to over sell to get you to buy (in), well that just smells fishy to me.	2017-11-13 00:01:24Z	DarcyThomas

12892	@threetimes Hi. Yes it's quite normal on the rest of the body. However I don't have much body hair ( average ). The last time I visited a doctor was a couple of years ago, can't quite recall, but I don't remember any specific test being ran.	2017-07-16 04:17:20Z	
12892	Well what they may have looked at would be thyroid, vitamin levels, etc.	2017-07-16 04:26:33Z	threetimes
12892	Do you have any bald spots on the head, even tiny ones?  I know with alopecia you can loose hair, have it regrow as white & then later have it grow in as dark, but generally you will have some bald patches as far as I know of it.  I am not aware of it happening without an actual bald spot (even a very small bald spot).	2017-07-17 09:00:52Z	threetimes
12888	If someone is asking you, simply give them a more detailed answer than yes/no. "It's been 14 months since my last full period, but I had a few days of spotting about three months ago." That's a more useful answer than either "14 months" or "3 months" when asked how long since your last period.	2017-12-06 16:20:53Z	Kate Gregory
12886	I can tell you that the risk is so low that the benefits of vaccines by far outweigh the risk of such disease. Otherwise, no one would do vaccines. Whether risks actually exist and how low the probability is exactly I don't know.	2017-07-09 10:59:10Z	Narusan-in-coma
12886	Marco, diseases and medicines aren't so dissimilar. They're all poisons of a sort. You can actually die by ingesting too much water, it happens to marathon runners fairly often. The trick in medicine is in weighing pros and cons of all the options and finding the ones that create the greatest benefit with the least harm. Vaccines, like all other drugs, have risks, and like all other drugs, probably even kill people here and there, as does aspirin. But on average, the risk of dying in pain from any number of infectious diseases is significantly more likely, and significantly worse, so vaccines.	2017-07-09 12:54:41Z	TheEnvironmentalist

12880	Good question, I'm interested in seeing if someone finds data on this.  But I have to say that from a health perspective, I'm not sure why you've dieted, as your BMI is underweight.  Women who are underweight put themselves at higher risk for poor bone mineral density and pathological fractures, endocrine dysfunction, infertility, anemia, hair loss, weakened immunity...

12878	These are very good questions that you should ask your doctor. On Health.SE, they are considered off-topic because we can't see you and we can't examine you. This does not mean that this effort is wasteful: Bring a printed version of your questions to the appointment, this way, you will not forget any important aspects you wanted to know about.

12852	Welcome to health SE :-). We'd love to help, but the way it is written the question both asks for personal medical advice and has several questions in one, which makes it very difficult to answer.

Or, are there any general hygiene advice for people with braces. May I suggest editing your question to make it more on-topic. You can have a look at our help center for guidance.

12793	providing immediate and permanent relief from pain -- It doesn't sound very permanent if it keeps recurring.	2017-06-30 14:42:47Z	Carey Gregory
12793	@CareyGregory - The only truly permanent relief from pain is death.  If I've had the same back pain for weeks, and then after "relief" I go months or years without that pain, I consider that a "permanent" fix.  The fact that my back (and, indeed, my whole body) is still susceptible to injury does not mean that a particular injury was not healed.	2017-06-30 16:35:22Z	
12793	I'd suggest calling it "long-term" since permanent doesn't mean months or years; it means forever. Not a criticism, just a suggestion.	2017-06-30 18:22:32Z	Carey Gregory
12793	@CareyGregory - OK, made that change.  But it might be important for me to clarify: "Back pain" is a very broad symptom, and "the back" is a very large and complex system.  I've seen chiropractors for "back pain" three times in my life.  I don't have evidence that in each case it was the same pathology causing the pain.  If each time they said something like, "Oh, your L4 vertebrae is out of line," then I might suggest it was a recurring injury.  But I don't remember any such details.	2017-07-02 16:48:26Z	
12791	Hmm... this seems like a personal health question, which health.se doesn't address. We handle general cases of questions (but not so general that a whole book or volume of books can be written about it).	2018-02-18 05:03:07Z	Dave Liu

12769	Painkillers can certainly make you addicted. However, I doubt that a simple dose of sedatives administered once will instantly trigger an addiction. In your case, there seems no need to worry.	2017-06-27 18:34:55Z	Narusan-in-coma
12768	I would strongly recommend not to take medication over a long time, everything has side effects. A GP is your best choice in this case. I'd also recommend you to ask a question on Workplace.SE how you could improve your working situation. Burn-outs are often not-recognised and can do great psychological and physical damage if untreated.	2017-06-27 19:49:11Z	Narusan-in-coma
12768	I would add that you can't substitute Modafinil for sleep over the long term. It works well for occasional use, but it is not a sleep replacement.	2017-06-28 01:50:32Z	Carey Gregory
12768	Stimulants (or near stimulants) may likely mean even less ability to sleep and contribute to burnout, more than likely severe burnout if you are barely sleeping as well. In the long run taking them would likely impact your ability to work. Is there a way you could find day time hours instead? If not, asking others who work nights how they manage to get sleep may help as well as prioritizing sleep over errands. And as with any drug good to check side effects first. rxlist.com/provigil-side-effects-drug-center.htm	2017-06-29 03:41:21Z	padma

12749	BTW, this chronicleflask.com/2015/08/29/… reminded me of the Horizon programme, where identical amounts of urine were produced (i.e. identical levels of dehydration) from heavy drinking vs. light drinking (of alcohol). The discussion in the comments was interesting, too.	2017-06-25 21:39:15Z	
12748	this at least two questions, maybe more. You'll find some already here about carbs in general and simple/complex. On the second one, they mean that ab exercises use up all your fat, not just belly fat, and arm exercises use up all your fat, not just arm fat, etc. How to lose weight is a very broad and complicated topic that can't be covered in a single question on this site.	2017-06-25 13:26:18Z	Kate Gregory
12748	My answer on simple/complex carbs may help with your first question.	2017-06-25 15:03:04Z	Chris
12748	The human body is a machine that has evolved to be fine tuned to survive with whatever Nature can provide, and it has evolved to be very robust, it's not a fragile machine prone to go off the rails unless micromanaged by calorie counting etc. (you have to ask how we could even exist today if that were the case). This means that we have the right enzymes to extract the glucose in exactly the right way (not too fast, not too slow)  for us provided the carbs come in the natural form. Refined carbs will then be absorbed way too fast.	2017-06-25 20:34:32Z	Count Iblis

12745	I grew up in south Florida. When I lived there, I could be outside during high summer without a shirt from dawn to dusk without burning. I have now lived in New England for the last 30 years. If I went to south Florida today and spent more than about 20 minutes in full sun, I would be badly burned. The point is, there may be no such thing as a healthy tan, but there is such a thing as a protective tan. You might need to factor that into your question.	2017-06-24 22:00:46Z	Carey Gregory
12745	define body - naked? bathing suit? shorts and a tshirt? hat? Define "safe" - won't get a sunburn that puts you in the hospital? won't burn at all? won't contribute to long term damage that may cause melanoma? won't contribute to wrinkies or "cosmetic" damage?  And finally, even in California, what time of year and is it sunny or cloudy?	2017-06-25 13:29:43Z	Kate Gregory
12745	@KateGregory: I've tried to further clarify my question, though I suspect your point is to show it's unanswerable even with the clarifications.	2017-06-26 08:03:43Z	
12745	Do you define sunburns as permanent damage?	2017-06-26 22:13:36Z	Carey Gregory
12745	@CareyGregory: no, but sunburns are detrimental, so I've further clarified the question.	2017-06-26 22:29:39Z	
12742	Could you remove the personal information? It is unnecessary to answer the question itself. Please note that personal diagnosis or recommendations are off-topic on the site. By removing the irrelevant information, your question will be on-topic.	2017-06-24 22:23:55Z	Narusan-in-coma
12741	Obviously that's only a benefit in a hot climate. It's quite the opposite in a cold climate.	2017-06-24 15:21:20Z	Carey Gregory
12741	Can you please define a cold climate, and what about indoors where there is heating?  Plus some people's bodies will start to thermoregulate against heat at a lower temperature than others	2017-06-24 15:26:49Z	
12741	What does the body need to do to remain at its normal temperature? If it needs to radiate heat, that's a hot climate. If it needs to retain heat, that's a cold climate. Being naked inside a heated building in a cold climate isn't a benefit since the building's temperature would have to be raised to remain comfortable. If being naked in a cold climate has benefits, those benefits have nothing to do with temperature regulation.	2017-06-24 15:38:33Z	Carey Gregory
12728	According to cancer.org, 2 in 4 people die due to cancer. As almost all accidents and diseases are not lethal anymore, you are more and more likely to die because of cancer. Therefore, you shouldn't worry about it. If you are still nervous, the WHO has a list of substances that are known for increasing cancer risks.	2017-06-22 16:18:52Z	Narusan-in-coma
12728	@Narusan Thanks for the info - I looked at your link and it says 22.62% (the highest which is for men, women are sub 20%) of people in the United States have a risk of dying from cancer, so closer to 1 in 5 I would say. So statistically speaking that seems to back up that it is odd that of the previous 4 owners (2 married couples), 50% of them died of cancer and specifically at this one house.	2017-06-22 16:29:51Z	
12728	As Mark's answer points out, there's absolutely nothing unusual about that. People die of cancer all the time, so having two die in one home over the course of 25-30 years isn't surprising at all. Did you have the home professionally inspected before purchase? If so, that's one of the things you paid for. Home inspectors look for things such as lead paint, asbestos, etc. Did you have it tested for radon? If not, go buy a radon test kit and do it yourself.	2017-06-23 00:46:30Z	Carey Gregory
12728	What passes through your mouth is more important.	2017-06-23 02:05:15Z	Count Iblis
12728	While it could be a coincidence you might want to get your home tested for radon as Carey says. If either of their cancers were due to chemicals in the house possibly it was something that off gassed way back when and may not be a problem now. Or they could have been really into spraying pesticides or herbicides, didn't eat healthy foods or just bad luck. You could also ask an inspector if there is anything else to look out for.	2017-06-29 03:35:56Z	padma

12725	I think general fatique is just too broad and has too many causes. If you are talking about mental fatique, you could ask for improving long time concentration. For physical tiredness, ask a question in this way.	2017-06-22 14:17:38Z	Narusan-in-coma

12702	Two suggestions to improve this question: 1. Personal questions are considered off-topic, and although you are not explicitly requesting any, the paragraph about your baldness is unnecessary information and could be removed. 2. It would be great to ask another question about coffee and the effects of onion and coffee "therapy" together.	2017-06-20 20:08:02Z	Narusan-in-coma

12690	Most carbonated mineral water is a little salty. It's possible you were low on electrolytes. This has nothing to do with being addicted, but just that you needed something, Next time you feel that way try eating a salty snack and see if you experience the same relief.	2017-06-23 00:48:35Z	Kate Gregory
12690	@Kate Gregory no, salty food (such as fish) does not help. Also, there is salty milk product "Tan" which has carbonated and non-carbonated versions, and only carbonated one reduces thristyness. I suspect, this is because CO2 affects drink receptors stronger, so that normal drink no longer felt by those receptors.	2017-06-23 02:12:33Z

Many of those shampoos just help puff up each strand so it looks thicker.

12633	did your doctors investigate your heart at all (listen to it beat, take blood to check for chemicals?" If so, what they told you was "this is not about your heart" -- they probably don't know what it is about, only that it's nothing to worry about. If not, then go back and ask for reassurance that your heart is ok, not an explanation of an intermittent pain you are not currently feeling.	2017-06-13 14:23:24Z	Kate Gregory

12611	@L.B. Is it worth making that into a proper answer?  I'm afraid I asked a question that is probably hard to provide good references for.  @ Narusan Should I modify the question slightly?  I meant to make clear that the pressing should not be done on a human, but perhaps I was not.	2017-06-14 08:58:51Z

12590	@L.B. already done but that doesn't help me very much. I already have a therapist. If I'm searching for a new one now my health insurance won't pay anymore, then I have to wait a few months again and my parents don't have that much money.	2017-06-12 17:01:03Z	
12590	I believe it is difficult to deal with a doctor who can't help you while having limited options because of your insurance. I don't know the options in Austria, but maybe you could join some form of group therapy if it exists for your type of problem. It might be cheaper and help you  until insurance covers a different therapist. In the meanwhile I hope your therapist will step up and try to help you as much as possible - although the ideal case would be that they have experience with your problem, they can also read about it, consult a colleague and change their approach to fit your needs.	2017-06-12 17:26:30Z	Lucky

12589	How do you know that you have 2,000 calories left to eat?	2017-06-13 15:31:04Z	Narusan-in-coma
12589	Because I make a food diary using fitness pal scanning all food eaten. Yesterday I hate 2500 calories minus 4702 as shown on Fitbit leaves about 2000	2017-06-13 15:38:31Z	
12589	Watch out! You usually eat 2500 kilocalories, not calories. Usually [this is experience] sport does not lead to loosing weight, only eating less does. You are consuming 2500 kilocalories and burning 4 kilocalories, if all units are correct.	2017-06-13 15:40:12Z	Narusan-in-coma

12574	This is asking for personal diagnosis and considered off-topic on Health.SE. One option is to ask what each number (creatinine, hemoglobin etc.) does to the body. Health.SE is a site that will help you understand health related body processes, not an internet doctor!	2017-06-09 14:09:17Z	Narusan-in-coma

12549	Questions requesting medical advice are off topic here, so I'm voting to close this question, but I will say this: Never mind getting up -- the falls need to stop. Sooner or later one of those falls is going to cause significant injury such as a fractured hip or head injury, which could end his life or end his life as he knows it. So quit trying to figure out how to get him off the ground and figure out how to keep him off the ground in the first place.	2017-06-08 00:39:09Z	Carey Gregory
12549	@narusan "fixed language" is a terrible edit comment. Especially in this case where you removed any mention of falling, which is what the question is all about. You did a good job of removing fluff but remember to leave the question in a useful and answerable state.	2017-06-08 13:34:48Z	Kate Gregory
12549	@Narusan I like to be specific: are you fixing spelling, grammar, punctuation? Did you rearrange sentences? Did you remove meta talk or fluff?

12533	I think the "imaginary" man needs to quit trying to rationalize his drinking and look at the results. He drinks and his liver function declines. He stops drinking and his liver function recovers. Eventually it will stop recovering.	2017-06-05 23:48:42Z	Carey Gregory
12533	And, BTW, those are some very realistic looking "imaginary" lab reports.	2017-06-05 23:50:00Z	Carey Gregory
12533	@CareyGregory what about the values being normal? I mean for something bob basically asked 3 doctors and one laboratory girl. He got 2 different opinions. Maybe everyones values go up after drinking like this? some a bit more, some a bit less maybe?	2017-06-06 00:14:06Z	
12533	Everyone doesn't binge drink so there's no group to compare him to. What we know is binge drinkers have a habit of dying younger and quit often of liver disease. The liver is remarkably good at repairing itself, but that ability isn't inexhaustible. Keep injuring it weekly and sooner or later those lab numbers aren't going to bounce back.	2017-06-06 01:34:51Z	Carey Gregory
12533	That is your personal guess? I mean it all makes sense to me. But I guess the reason bob went to the liver expert, was to know a) if there is treatment and b) how exactly he should behave. Now he basically got c) all is fine. Which I am sure, made bob confused	2017-06-07 00:56:35Z	
12529	Welcome to Health! You should write down all these good questions and ask them to a doctor in one of the talks prior to the surgery. Right now, your question has too many aspects and is too individual to be suitable for a Stackexchange format. However, the doctors are supposed to answer them prior to surgery. If you want answers now, I'd highly encourage you to split each question into a separate post.	2017-06-06 07:30:36Z	Narusan-in-coma
12529	@Narusan thank you for responding my post. I will for sure split each question and ask them in separate posts, but, I was wondering which part is individual since I made sure that all of my questions could have general answers.	2017-06-06 16:25:08Z	
12529	On my last visit to the doctor, we talked briefly about how my surgery procedure will be, he told me that I have to make a decision on what kind of ligament do I want to get the ACL replacement from, the side part of my knee or the ligament under small bone of the knee, I'm sorry I just don't know the names of them.  I would like to ask what would be the best decision and why, I just don't know what would be the differences one over the other. This part is very individual as it depends on your personal medical background etc. A way to fix this is to ask what the pro and cons are. I'd	2017-06-06 17:35:02Z	Narusan-in-coma

12390	Do you really think science has teased out all the intricacies of nutrition and that it's really as simple as the dozen or two compounds they know we need now? I hope not because I think that's a naive viewpoint. Check again in 50 years and I think they'll have a whole new list with all new RDAs. That doesn't matter much to most people because most people get most of their nutrients from food, but it's going to matter to you because you'll be depending on science being perfect, which it is not.	2017-05-23 17:39:39Z	Carey Gregory
12390	@CareyGregory see my edit.	2017-05-23 21:11:32Z	
12390	Your edits don't change my comment. My point is that food has hundreds of compounds in thousands of combinations and science is far from fully understanding what effect all those combinations have. Simply making sure you get enough of a dozen of them is unlikely to be adequate, and the definition of "enough" is likely to change over time. You recognized this yourself when you said Pretty much all the information I can find suggests this is a bad idea.	2017-05-23 21:21:41Z	Carey Gregory
12390	@CareyGregory I can construct an extremely varied and nutritious diet that everyone would agree is very healthy except for the fact that it contains no calcium. Everyone would also agree that a similar diet with enough calcium is better. The point is that I need calcium. I can get it from supplements, or from kale and such. It doesn't seem sensible to assume that I should eat lots of kale as opposed to lots of other veggies just in case the kale also contains some other mysterious nutrients - the same could be said for the other veggies that I'd eat instead but don't contain calcium.	2017-05-23 21:32:44Z	
12390	You can construct an extremely nutritious diet that contains no calcium. My point is what else might it be missing? You're paying attention to calcium because it's one of those couple dozen compounds identified (so far) as being important, but my contention is there are others you just don't know about yet.	2017-05-23 23:18:21Z	Carey Gregory

12374	there are a lot of numbers you might be asking for when you say "cost" - do you mean what the practice needs to spend to give you that service (in salaries, rent etc), what the practice can charge you or your insurance for that service, what other revenue the practice is likely to bring in if there are followup tests and such required as a result of you getting a physical, or what you are likely to gain by catching something early while it can still be treated or reversed more cheaply compared to waiting until the symptoms drive you to seek treatment. Which are you trying to understand?	2017-05-21 14:46:52Z	Kate Gregory
12374	@KateGregory you're right indeed, I tried to improve the question.  Basically consider it as the market value costs of healthcare decisions for an average customer (as what constitutes life threatening I think is a blurry line?) in terms of what they would be driven to treat.  So it'd just about boil down to (the risen cost of things they could've treated sooner and cheaper had they known better) - ((cost of checkups) + (cost of things they would've treated that would not have ever caused issue had they not known from checkups)).	2017-05-23 07:22:29Z	
12374	However, though it would seem such data would be of significant focus given it's widespread applicability and the money involved... given the challenge of finding such data in peer reviewed work or other publications, I'll certainly take any answer that has any even rough connection to the options you suggested, as any would really offer a bit of insight into the true monetary value of a checkup.	2017-05-23 07:24:15Z	
12374	I have no idea of US costs, but here is a Canadian document: health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/phys_services/docs/… for the actual checkup itself, not any tests arising from it.	2017-05-23 10:26:25Z	Kate Gregory

12317	Sorry I can’t answer your question, but I am wondering the exact same thing. I have extensive arthritis and have found hot (Bikram) Yoga to be extremely beneficial. Sometimes, though, I’ll overdo it and aspirin helps with the resulting pain. I’d like to take a couple of full strength aspirin every night, but maybe I should take something else that won’t cause bleeding. I hope someone does have a real answer to your question.	2018-01-15 12:17:39Z	Lawrence W. Nelson

12305	Somewhere between minutes and days. Honestly, there are so many variables that almost any numbers you pluck out of thin air will be credible. Suffice it to say that a weapon of large caliber, high muzzle velocity, and/or use of ammunition designed to maximize injury will produce greater injury and more rapid death in most cases. For example, surviving a hunting rifle shot to the lungs is unlikely, but even a .22 pistol can be equally lethal if it happens to hit a major vessel.	2017-05-15 23:08:45Z	Carey Gregory
12305	It's true that it is very hard to estimate. Thank you for your input, I will make a reasonable guess and see how it goes.	2017-05-16 08:48:34Z	
12304	What is your question?	2017-05-14 15:16:30Z	Carey Gregory
12304	What could explain the textures and weird sensations that I felt inside her vagina? Is something wrong with her, is it normal?	2017-05-15 12:35:27Z	
12304	This very much resembles personal medical advice solicitation and even though you are asking for someone else, not yourself we can't give a precise answer over the internet.	2017-05-15 20:27:48Z	Lucky
12304	Ditto to Lucky's comment. It's probably perfectly normal but you're asking us to provide a gynecological diagnosis based on your description of a sexual encounter. Obviously that's not possible.	2017-05-15 23:12:28Z	Carey Gregory
12304	I do pelvic exams fairly often; EVERY person's anatomy is a little different. And you can google "vaginal rugae" to educate yourself. But @Carey is right - no one could answer the question "is it normal" or "is something wrong with her" without an exam. Consider openly discussing things with her. After all, you're engaging in intimate sexual activity, so why don't you feel comfortable talking about sexuality with her?	2017-05-17 06:14:43Z	DoctorWhom
12294	I would suggest seeing your doc as we can't diagnose you as there are a myriad of reasons. But things that came to my mind were iron deficiency because I've been having shortness of breath as of late, but then I read on to see that you are physically active & have energy. Maybe exercise induced asthma?? But really... no one on here will be able to tell you so  ask your GP. There's so many possible reasons. Good luck.	2017-05-13 17:57:31Z	Butterfly and Bones
12294	All mammals get out of breath as far as I am aware, the question is not about my personal health, but rather, what factors exist - probably something to do with oxygen right?	2017-05-13 17:59:32Z	
12294	Right. I gave a very cursory glance. Sorry about that! (I'm having issues concentrating as of late). Yeah, what I've discovered recently is how/why iron levels impact shortness of breath & just general malaise & concentration. It deals with the amount of hemoglobin (oxygen levels in your blood) being sent to organs. Again, I'm not an expert at all. But yeah... I didn't realize all the vast symptoms a deficiency in one thing can cause. So I can't even imagine all the other factors involved.	2017-05-13 18:05:28Z	Butterfly and Bones
12294	Thats kind of the stuff I was looking for in an answer (I know that haemoglobin transports oxygen but I don't get why 2 people with the same amount of blood, breathing in the same amount of oxygen, use up that oxygen at different speeds.)	2017-05-13 18:06:42Z	
12294	Also, another odd thing that I was told years ago by my orthopedic surgeon who operated on my spine was... that even though I have fully developed lungs... that I didn't use my lungs to their full capacity because of my high degree of spinal curvature -- lordosis & scoliosis combo. (I haven't researched this to confirm this, which is why I'm not including it in an official answer, but to just throw it out there as another random potential factor). But I'm interested in this. So thanks.	2017-05-13 18:18:05Z	Butterfly and Bones

12292	Are you asking about the number of people in the country who are filing prescriptions, or the number of prescriptions a given pharmacist fills in a shift? If the former, would be a pointless thing to study, it's just math.  If the average pharmacists has a probability of (say) 0.1% of making a mistake on a single prescription, then the expected number of mistakes made in the country will be directly proportional to the number of prescriptions in the country.	2017-05-13 03:05:56Z	Keshav Srinivasan

12223	This is going to depend tremendously on the location and on what the prescription is for. I doubt the age or living circumstances of the patient are relevant. I have picked up prescriptions for other people and they have picked them up for me, but all that demonstrates is that a handful of pharmacists are willing to hand over pretty mild things under some circumstances.	2017-05-07 15:27:26Z	Kate Gregory

12214	@CareyGregory Checked with my source for more details. It appears that it's just that blood loss lowers your body temperature, and if you get too cold you might start shivering (which makes the bleeding worse). This, of course, won't occur in a warm environment. A friend of mine actually did suggest that seizures may be triggered by going into shock, so interesting you bring that up. That sounds like a very complicated case to treat. Thanks.	2017-05-07 04:40:30Z

12199	I read that tinnitus is caused by overactive neurons in the region related to hearing (when it's not a physical injury or related to hearing loss). So if you take caffeine or chocolate, it will stimulate the brain and increase tinnitus. Sorry I don't have a solution. You can follow up with that research. My guess is some type of electro-magnetic cranial stimulation might have an effect on it. Maybe depressants will also have an effect? I prefer mild stimulants.	2017-05-08 14:41:22Z	Chloe

12164	This is an excellent question - I am eager to see if a psychologist/psychiatrist can offer insight into how it is diagnosed in practice.  The root question of how to define what constitutes a delusion is an issue that stands in the overlap between psychology and philosophy.   I imagine that your specific question's answer will involve the extent/degree of the belief, and the degree to which it creates disruption in the individual's life.	2017-05-02 19:23:37Z	DoctorWhom

12164	I asked my proff today. He says Guilt can be both as an ideation or a delusion. Although it is sometimes obvious when a delusion, we need to establish the fixity and firmness that a delusion has.

12156	@Narusan No I'm hiv negative. What I'm asking is that would it be possible for the condom to have invisible holes where liquids can leak through them? Or is it the case that if the condom has holes, no matter the size, it will break apart completely?	2017-05-01 23:20:53Z

12098	It may or may not be serious, the weakness etc are possible neurological symptoms, which have many possible causes - but there's no way to know without a clinical evaluation.  Diagnosing medical conditions is complicated and that's why it takes many years of study and training to get a license to do it. Not something that even a doctor could do without a clinical evaluation - let alone here on Health SE.

12098	hi doc. i'd like to make an update to this post by saying that I did visit the ER on May 17 and they diagnosed me with "Allergic Rhinitis with Sinus headache" and the problem is that I'm still having symptoms such as: Headache, one side of nose congested, pressure behind my nose, and sometimes pressure feeling on top of my head. He prescribed me acetaminophen, nasal spray, and zyrtec allergy medication.	2017-06-01 13:18:42Z	
12098	Some days the headache feels around my forehead are and other days it feels like it's on top of the skull..anyway the pressure feeling is still there and I'm wondering if the doctor misdiagnosed me. They did a blood and a urine test and everything came normal. When the doc did a physical examination on me, he said my nose was inflamed. Now I'm just wondering if he did a correct diagnosis because I still have those fearful thoughts of it being a tumor...I've had these symptoms since April 22 and it's worrying me.	2017-06-01 13:19:01Z	
12098	I'd also like to mention that the first 3 weeks the pressure was more severe and I had dizziness, but now I don't. Still, been suffering from this headache though ever since... :/	2017-06-01 13:19:06Z

12094	Coke Zero is terrible for you. That aside, you need to be doing exercises which target the specific part of your body you wish to improve. At present, merely hiking will only improve your overall stamina, your leg strength, and your lats from swinging your arms. That's it. In order to target your belly you need to do stomach exercises. Try doing situp punches. Lay flat on your back, scoot your feet towards your butt as close as you feel comfortable, hold both your arms up like you are about to punch, sit all the way up, lightly punch with left then right (1-2), then lay back down. Repeat.	2017-05-04 22:43:08Z	Travis J
12094	@TravisJ Fat cannot be targeted. Your body will lose fat wherever fat exists and all the targeted exercises in the world won't make a bit of difference. All it will do is tone the underlying muscles, which may help the appearance of a fat abdomen but won't cause any actual fat loss in that area.	2017-05-27 01:21:53Z	Carey Gregory

12070	OK, so maybe do this: Just ignore what people in your country do. Instead, wash and scrub your turmeric well, then throw it into your juicer (with the peel still on). Does this sound like a good plan?	2017-05-10 23:03:53Z	tealhill

12043	Did they genuinely forget the tooth?  Probably the best treatment would be to educate them on first aid and the importance of procedures for medical emergencies.  Chalk it up as a life lesson, as to knowing when a few seconds assessing a situation can be spared.  As for the tooth, the 30 minute limit is probably for optimal recovery.  How the tooth was stored in the interim, and at what temperature, is also a factor.  I seem to remember that the pulp becomes unsafe for use if it is away from the body for more than an hour.	2017-04-26 03:05:08Z	can-ned_food

12031	Welcome to Health SE. I understand that you are trying to learn about what could be causing this, but policy prohibits seeking medical advice on this site.  Part of why is that it could cause harm to give you advice in any setting other than an exam by a clinician.  Skin is especially tricky.

12006	Comments are for improving/clarifying the question, not extended discussion. I agree, it isn't looking for a diagnosis, the basic question is "Is it normal in very distal fractures to take longer than 8 weeks to show signs of callus". However, the question directly following that, and the extended history both make it seem like it is asking for a diagnosis. And I would caution about asking about pain levels, as those are very subjective from individual to individual depending on their pain tolerance.	2017-04-20 21:49:54Z	JohnP

11979	More likely this isn't a nutritional thing. Thinking you can solve these types of problems by simply eating something else is often looking for an easy way out that's doomed to be ineffective. Not that nutrition isn't important, but other things to add: Hobbies, physical activity, mental activity (puzzles, etc), reading, social interaction, therapy, rest, structure, and avoid things that have sort of been bringing brain functions down as a society over the past decade; avoid getting sucked in to the mindless quick-reward mobile games, for example, look for more challenging games.

11974	@JimBalter Suppose I would have gotten extremely obese by overeating. I currently eat 3500 Kcal/day but I exercise a lot and I weight about 54 kg, so I would probably have to stop exercising (saves about 1000 Kcal/day) and eat more to start to gain weight. Eventually I'll become extremely obese, get a gastric bypass and then I'm restricted to, say, 1500 Kcal.I lose weight, but then I'll hit my current 54 kg at a BMI of 19 kg/m^2 and then what? Because without exercise I would currently need about 2500 Kcal/day...	2017-04-18 04:20:56Z	
11974	"I would currently need about 2500 Kcal/day" -- obviously not.	2017-04-18 04:29:26Z	Jim Balter
11974	@JimBalter According to this website I burn slightly less than 800 Kcal per day. If I subtract 800 Kcal from my calorie intake of between 3500 and 4000 kcal a day then yields a calorie intake without exercise of between 2700 and 3200 Kcal/day. Now, it could be that I could eat less and the metabolic rate would adjust itself to that, but I don't see how I could eat just 1500 Kcal a day and not get severely  ill. 1500 Kcal is less than what I just had for dinner.	2017-04-18 05:30:56Z	
11961	It's safe because all such tests have been designed while taking into account rigorous safety standards. The assumptions made about the dangers of radiation in these safety standards is that exposure to small amounts of radiation can be harmful to the point that it's actually not all that credible. So, it's so safe that even if the C-14 would have been replaced by an isotope that's a thousand times more radioactive, it would still be harmless.	2017-04-16 22:03:44Z	Count Iblis

11956	Interesting idea.  But if the virus remained on the surface of the lips, or within the mouth, but hadn't been absorbed by mouth tissues, then I'm figuring it would prevent infection, and it wouldn't infect lower down the GI track.  Are you thinking that infection usually occurs inside several minutes?  Or that herpes isn't vulnerably to those antiseptics?	2017-04-16 16:24:41Z	
11956	Those antiseptics most likely kill herpes virus, but whether they could reach every virus in the mouth and esophagus in sufficient concentration before it was able to infect isn't as likely.

I have never heard of this effect and it is a very strong claim. Can you edit your question to include a study for that as well? What's more, the source you cite refers to more that one study, in fact the same author (McNally) found that a different mode of administration of H2O2 (via soaking contact lenses) has a much lower threshold of irritation.	2017-04-16 21:26:06Z	Lucky

Acne care is individualized.  Didn't they tell you whether to continue your previous regimen or not when the antibiotics were prescribed?  Perhaps you forgot to ask about moisturizers, and they should be the ones to clarify it for you.	2017-07-05 09:31:57Z	DoctorWhom

11908	Welcome to Health SE :-). I edited the last part of your question, because we can't comment whether a result is good or bad (or not too bad) - this would constitute personal medical advice, which is off-topic. We can, however, provide terminology clarification as well as give some "normal" ranges provided in scientific literature. I hope that you don't mind the change and I also hope that all goes well at your next doctor's appointment.	2017-04-12 18:13:32Z	Lucky

11907	He should go to the ER very soon. A hemoglobin of 6 can be fatally low, especially since he's still bleeding.  The stomach fullness is possibly ascites, the excess sleeping is possibly encephalopathy, the bleeding could be kidney failure or rectal bleeding - - there is no way to tell without an evaluation.  But these are bad signs. He may sooner or later want to see a hepatologist (liver doctor), assuming his drinking was long-term, as he might have cirrhosis.  But at the moment getting emergent care may be an issue of life or death. Ask the ER doctor what specialist to see.	2017-04-13 05:47:50Z	DoctorWhom

11894	I don't understand your question. What do you mean by painting models?	2017-04-11 17:17:28Z	Carey Gregory
11894	@CareyGregory Thanks. I have answered your question in a "clarification edit". I have now also included "drawing models" into the terminology, so as to further clarify.	2017-04-11 20:54:35Z	
11894	I'm still unclear. Are you asking how long a model can sit under a bright spotlight, or are you envisioning some sort of light that's focused tightly on their eye or is extraordinarily bright?	2017-04-12 17:58:46Z	Carey Gregory
11894	@CareyGregory The second option. I am interested in permanent eye damage due to a continuously focused artificial light source.	2017-04-12 17:59:50Z	
11895	What are you trying to monitor? Some implantable glucose monitors can do this, though I can't say whether it's "arterial" blood. Is capillary blood good enough?	2017-04-11 15:16:35Z	anongoodnurse
11895	Testosterone //comment length	2017-04-11 15:19:22Z	
11895	Then no. There is no reason to monitor testosterone continuously; it's not life threatening (as is hypoglycemia.) No sane businessman would devote the funds to develop and test such a device, and the risk of side effects (mainly infection) and cost of placement/upkeep/etc much too high for basically no additional return over drawn blood.	2017-04-11 15:25:18Z	anongoodnurse
11895	@anongoodnurse I can think of one example that would potentially be useful and worth the risks: monitoring potassium levels in people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Wouldn't need to be arterial blood, though.	2017-04-11 17:15:53Z	Carey Gregory
11895	@CareyGregory - I was specifically addressing the OP's concern. Even with HPP, I doubt a manufacturer would be willing to invest at this point; the number of people with the disorder  are orders of magnitude fewer than diabetics. In all my years of practice, I've seen one case of HPP. Diabetics? Many hundreds at least.	2017-04-11 18:35:00Z	anongoodnurse

11863	There are many things besides thyroid hormone level that can cause hair loss, increased heart rate and irritability. I would say consult your doctor again and have other blood work done where they check your white blood cell count, etc...It could even be a neurological disorder like anxiety	2017-04-08 12:52:44Z	Noah
11863	I know many people (older women for the most part) who are bothered by thyroid symptoms and want a dosage change while their doctors insist the levels are within the desired range. So anecdotally, yes, you can be experiencing symptoms while results claim you're fine. But this is something to discuss with the doctor, whether pushing for a dosage change or for testing to see what non-thyroid explanation there is for what you are experiencing.	2017-04-08 16:19:02Z	Kate Gregory

11856	@CareyGregory: Why did you remove the entire question text?	2017-04-09 07:04:46Z	
11856	Because it made the question a request for personal medical advice, which is prohibited here. Besides, it's irrelevant to the question. You can put it back, but if you do I'll vote to close the question as off topic.	2017-04-09 15:01:39Z	Carey Gregory

Finally, are you pregnant or otherwise in a category that should NOT risk chickenpox even a tiny bit?	2017-04-07 14:56:24Z	Kate Gregory

11851	@Polisetty The fact that only a small amount of blood was visible doesn't speak to the source or clinical significance. I recommend that you wait until you're a licensed physician and have examined the patient before telling them "no need to worry."	2017-04-30 23:12:16Z	Carey Gregory

11842	I have an almost identical (if not actually identical) problem and had it looked at by a sports physiotherapist. She said that the damage can be to the small bones in the hand and/or the tissue which wraps the wrist (can't recall the name.) Avoid weight bearing activity which bends the hand back. I've had the problem for a long time and never completely gotten rid of recurrences, but I'm not in regular pain. Press ups on fists are a good replacement, for example. Basically, anything which keeps the hand/wrist straight, whether lifting or not.	2017-08-21 09:40:30Z	Matt W
11840	While not specifically addressing the average time, depolarization starts in the SA node and travels through the heart causing contraction. If there is a delay in one spot, that could indicate damage as the electric signal reroutes.

11816	Yes, if the hit was really strong something might have "moved" inside. I'm no doctor and not 100% sure about the PTH thing hence only comment, but you should really go to the doctor again, and this time telling about the hit.	2017-04-04 12:47:43Z	Shadow Wizard

11754	Welcome to health SE :-). We can't offer personal medical advice here, your questions are best answered by a doctor in person, they know much more about your condition than we could over the internet. What I can't see from your question is where do you see that the pathologist said explicitly that there is no malignancy? It was the pathologist who referred you to the surgeon in the first place, wasn't it? To resolve any conflicting information from 2 MDs you can either go back to them and ask for clarification, or see a third one.	2017-03-30 11:05:34Z	Lucky
11754	Thank you for updating your question- I actually wrote an answer (for the general case) along those lines, which hopefully sheds some more light on the situation for others as well as you.

11754	Before my own diagnosis I thought a biopsy was to see if something needed to be removed, with the default being to leave it. I've learned that a biopsy is mostly to see if something can be left, with the default being remove it. If your pathologist isn't sure, it's coming out.	2017-03-31 00:22:16Z	Kate Gregory
11754	I don't see anything in the pathologist report that says it ISN'T malignant.  I do see some concerning features like atypical proliferation, and that they want more sample.  Depending on size and location, some dermatologists and onc surgeons will do a biopsy by excising the whole thing with an estimated margin - then go back to excise wider depending on pathology report. But others punch to ensure depth is measured. Also, melanoma is practically malignant by definition. They spread readily and rapidly so people don't mess around with them.	2017-04-01 02:24:49Z	DoctorWhom
11752	Donald Trump sleeps less than you,  Modi, the Indian Prime minister sleeps even less. And we can read here: "McChrystal is reported to run 7 to 8 miles (11 to 13 km) daily, eat one meal per day, and sleep four hours a night."	2017-03-31 07:20:06Z	Count Iblis
11752	Those are anecdotes of individuals, and say nothing about their actual health.  Instead, look at trustworthy resources on the topic.	2017-04-01 02:54:13Z	DoctorWhom
11752	@DoctorWhom That's right, but this also depends on what you want to get out of your life. If Trump were to collapse and die tomorrow, he'll still have lived for quite some time in reasonable health. Also you have to take into account that 8 hours sleep (which I personally do stick to) is going to cut a third out of your effective lifespan, while 4 hours sleep as Thatcher managed to do, amounts to only a sixth of your lifetime spent in bed. By the time I'm as old as Thatcher when she died, it would be misleading to say that I've outlived her.	2017-04-01 20:31:55Z	Count Iblis
11752	@CountIblis Yes some people do that, at whatever cost to their health.  But his question isn't whether it can be done, he asked if it was harmful to health. And there is plenty of research on it.  There are reasons why medical residents have limitations on work hours. There are varying degrees of sleep deprivation and individual differences.  But some of those mentioned may be exceptions to the rule.  I may be able to  manage a few nights of 4 hours like that, but my mind isn't as sharp and my time awake isn't as productive or energized as when I get 7-8 hours.	2017-04-01 23:31:36Z	DoctorWhom
11752	It's one thing to mention individuals who successfully deviate from the norm. It's another to say anyone can do it.  Being tired isn't always a symptom of sleep deprivation.  That is why I recommended reading about it, not saying "some people do it and are seemingly okay."  Also, for Thatcher or Trump for that matter, what defines whether one "outlives" another person?  Hours awake?  Total years left as a living human? Quality, physical health and personal satisfaction during fewer hours?  That's a great philosophical question we can take to Philosophy SE :)	2017-04-01 23:35:38Z	DoctorWhom

11740	Answer completely depends on the quality, location, severity and aggravating/ alleviating factors of the pain. For what it's worth I'm a rheumatologist. If taking ibuprofen for true anti-inflammatory effect, it may be worth speaking with your doctor to address underlying cause of inflammation.	2017-03-30 06:23:25Z	user426

11736	@Narusan You ask how it could - theeeeeoretically if masturbation were to result in decreased testosterone or increased estrogen (which it doesn't to my knowledge) that would be a way it would influence height, as testosterone and estrogen influence the maturation of growth plates of bones.  I agree with Carey.	2017-04-01 02:37:41Z	DoctorWhom

11731	It doesn't have a use by date, only the date it was prescribed.	2017-03-29 17:12:30Z

11731	Furthermore, any pain that prevents you from functioning normally, deserves a visit to the doctor's. We can't provide personal medical advice over the internet, because we simply can't have proper insight into the situation without seeing (and examining) you in person.

11725	Go to the doctor. But you should know that unless something is totally wrong with your shoulder your doctor will probably recommend physiotherapy to make it heal faster. If mild pain is making you restrict certain movements then that may have caused the healing process to have stagnated. Excruciating pain is your body's stop signal, mild pain is the signal to take it easy. Movement is necessary for self-repair mechanisms to work well.	2017-03-29 18:03:40Z	Count Iblis

11711	What kind of doctor and what kind of test?	2017-03-28 20:07:40Z	
11711	As for the doctor, a GP or gastroenterologist should do. I'd do the Ubiome test again (no idea if that's backed up by your health care, if price is an issue definitely talk to the doctor first). Your result is off by so much that there might be something wrong with the test.	2017-03-28 20:14:47Z	Narusan-in-coma
11711	You are basically taking a test of unknown provenance with an unknown quality of sample and diagnosing your own diseases. Please go see a medical professional with the results and see what they say, and if the test is actually worth anything.	2017-03-28 20:40:05Z	JohnP
11711	The thing is, I have seen many doctors already, and then just tell me they "don't know". And then I go home no better off than I was before. Doctors only want to see people with "easy" illnesses.	2017-03-28 20:43:45Z

11701	I think the way you plan your routine is highly dependent on your skin type as well as your hair type. For me, I have mixed skin type, between  oily skin and dry skin ( even it depends on the weather) , I used to  have  a mask of almond oil + castor oil , I do it once every two weeks, and  the results appears nice to me. you can also use coconut oil for moisturizing your hair. This is just a suggestion, it is not an answer.  I think the perfect way is to do your own routine according to you skin needs, type, and availability.

11696	This wouldn't be a valid comparison so I doubt anyone has done so. They're completely unrelated compounds, and it's not even established that either one is harmful to health.

11693	@Narusan, it's about the future of Stack Exchange. This won't be the last question about hookworms. There are separate tags for tapeworm, ringworm, etc. -- just being consistent with the website. Parasites is a great tag, which is why I included it (it wasn't included in this question before), but it can be too broad if people in the future are researching hookworms specifically.	2017-03-28 21:06:42Z	Pills N Pillows
11693	@PillsNPillows: Sorry, didn't know so many different worm-tags existed. Obviously if they do and we want to keep them, this one should be created for consistency. Maybe this should be addressed in Health Meta.	2017-03-28 21:10:44Z	Narusan-in-coma
11693	@Narusan, I hear ya! Maybe there needs to be categories within "parasite" section, and one of the categories can just be worms, etc. haha. I don't know! :) There's so many different types of parasites -- hard to say. But I get your point!	2017-03-28 21:15:50Z	Pills N Pillows

11672	Although cheese, chocolate etc. can exaserbate sleep walking problems, there are many different root causes of sleepwalking. Nobody here can properly address your health issues. Questions requesting personal medical advice are off-topic here. Such questions should be taken to your personal physician who can examine you and access your full medical records.	2017-03-24 13:39:09Z	Chris
11665	Welcome to health SE :-). Please, do go to your dentist they go through a lot of school and practice to help you with this sort of thing. The sooner you deal with the cavities, the better. I don't know of a reversing mechanism, you need your dentist's help on this. As for the question "whether air floss can damage the tooth with cavities due to the pressure" I think it might be answerable on SE, but needs a bit of editing so as not to look like a request for personal medical advice. I would suggest taking the unnecessary details out.	2017-03-26 07:52:17Z	Lucky
11665	Adding on to what Lucky said, Id strongly recommend you to make the question more impersonal. That way, personal diagnosis does not apply - and other people with similar problems but with not exactly the same circumstances can also benefit from the answer.	2017-03-27 14:49:27Z	Narusan-in-coma
11664	Welcome to health SE :-). I sympathyse with what you and your mom went through. We can't really offer personal medical advice here, it is strictly against the rules. I guess that the doctor who ordered the test has scheduled an appointment to discuss the results. I understand that the wait can be nerve-wracking, but you can get the best possible answer from the doctor who has full insight into your mom's case. Hang in there and best of luck!	2017-03-26 08:04:22Z	Lucky

11646	No, you're making a terrible decision. Filling cavities is not painful but having rotten teeth pulled is. Brushing and eating a bunch of calcium won't save the tooth. Now go see a dentist because we can't provide you with medical advice.	2017-03-23 00:45:48Z	Carey Gregory
11646	I second what @Carey said, go to the dentist ASAP. Do brush and floss to preserve your other teeth, but this one needs a doctor.The sooner, the better. We can't say whether you are making a right decision because it calls for personal advice, but we could on the other hand answer a more general question and look up for references on whether filling cavities is painful and how the doctors handle this, as well as what strategies are or are not effective in dealing with cavities (with references too, if there are any). You can always edit your question to make it more on-topic.	2017-03-23 02:50:49Z	Lucky
11646	A rotten teeth will hurt like hell. (1). Believe me. Whereas, just as Carey pointed out, filling a cavity won't. Please see your dentist as soon as possible to prevent serious damage to other teeth as well! If you are afraid of your dentist as a person, consider changing your dentist. If you are afraid of the dentist as a doctor and because of what he does, you have a very common fear.

11597	We can't help you on Health.SE. Only a doctor can. Go to a cardiologist and talk to them about your issues. This question is asking for personal diagnosis and is therefore off topic	2017-03-17 17:26:59Z	Narusan-in-coma
11597	In addition to what Narusan said, we usually say that if you are not satisfied with your doctor's opinion, you should visit a second doctor. Here, aside from a second GP, a cardiologist and a gastroenterologist (you did say the pain was similar to heartburn) would be a good idea.	2017-03-17 19:09:33Z	Lucky
11597	The most important issue is ruled out ... you have no signs for a heart attack or coronary heart desease ... and this is very good. The suggestion of Lucky is very good. Continuous "heartburn" is a common sign for digestive problems like increase gastric acid production. It can be associated with the new job and increased stress. I would go to a gastroenterologist for a check up.	2017-03-17 19:16:01Z	Schleifer Grigorij
11597	I had this sort of pain a few times, I noticed that doing "arm circles", helps me instantly, so I just stand up straight and rotate both my arms pretty fast, kind drawing 2 big circles with the tips of my hands; for inflammation I would recommend some fresh squeezed juice with ginger	2017-03-29 17:36:52Z	Omu
11597	"... i can run just over 2k without stopping..."  Assuming the doctors have given you the all clear on strenuous exercise, you should build on this e.g. via interval training to get to half an hour of running at a decent pace (say 12 km/h) 3 times per week as part of your exercise routine. This is then at, say, 70% of your maximum effort, so you would then be running faster and much longer than now without that feeling like a big effort. As long as there is nothing wrong with your heart, nothing will stop you from reaching this goal.	2017-03-29 18:18:09Z	Count Iblis
11595	saying "speed up the digestion" is vague. Drinking water can fix constipation (esp if it was caused by dehydration) but won't cause diarrhea. Which are you asking about?	2017-03-18 16:16:55Z	Kate Gregory
11595	@ Kate Gregory , Am asking about the role of water in digestion and not linking with diarrhea.	2017-03-20 07:04:35Z	
11595	And I am asking you to clarify what "speed up digestion" means.	2017-03-20 11:36:30Z	Kate Gregory
11595	@ Kate Gregory. "Speed up digestion" I mean, during consuming water often, whatever I eat its digested within 1 hr and again feeling hungry. This is what I mean as " Speed up digestion ".	2017-03-23 07:08:43Z	
11595	More importantly, this isn't just a habit.  Drinking too much water (exact amount varies but some say 2L is normal, over 4L is excessive as a guideline) can be dangerous for your kidneys, blood pressure, heart etc.  It also may indicate things like diabetes insipidus, psychogenic polydipsia, diabetes mellitus, renal or adrenal dysfunction, or other potentially serious conditions.  People have died from drinking too much water.  See a doctor as has been previously recommended.  This isn't something to keep putting off.	2017-04-26 08:56:38Z	DoctorWhom

11543	Ultrasounds are normally used for dating the beginning of the last period, not the conception date, unless requested is my understanding. If I am wrong someone correct me please. The ultrasound would be fine for a period starting December 23.  You also have to consider ovulation occurs typically 7 to 20 days after the period starts. It is possible that the other guy's sperm stayed long enough for an ovulation. But you had sexual relations in the middle of her most likely ovulation dates.   This favors you being the father, but the other guy is plausible in my opinion. I'm not an expert.	2017-03-14 18:08:44Z	KCasper

11505	@Paparazzi Well, it is possible, but I think it's unlikely. The younger brother has 8.34 kg of body fat. If we assume 9 % body fat for the older brother, he has about 6.03 kg. So, if the younger brother loses about 2.5kg of body fat to reach the same ratio of body fat to height, he would weigh the same as the older brother while still being smaller and less bulky.	2017-03-12 22:39:54Z

11487	That sounds very odd to me. I might be wrong of course since my relationship with DICOM is a passing-one at best (I'm a GP), but it is my understanding DICOM images are actually vector-based and thus do not have a limit on resolution by themselves. It might be that your CD has rasterized versions of the images, or might be that the software that is bundled on the CD along with the images is a crappy shareware viewer, as is more-commonly-than-I'd-like the case.	2017-03-14 23:33:14Z	Gregorio Litenstein
11487	Thanks, the biggest files I could find on the CD was not very large (325KB) which was rendered to a 384x384 bitmap image. So it does seem like there might be some extra information in that file. I'll try some other applications. Maybe it's like you said, the software probably does a poor job of displaying the images.	2017-03-16 13:37:17Z	
11486	This question could be phrased a lot better. A person can simultaneously have a genius level IQ and debilitating language disorder.

11469	@Narusan It's well known that a sugar high is often followed by a crash.	2017-03-08 22:59:27Z	Mike Waters
11469	I'm not sure the premise of "keeping the brain excited" is a very sound and sensible approach. It eventually tires out and brings about the opposite of happiness, if it keeps being stimulated for too long. Also, you have to see what it gets excited for. Some people with previous experiences of depression etc. play a lot of computer games or have some substance dependnency. Surely their brain gets stimulated, but that doesn't necessarily made them live better at all. I'd say striving for balance and resting when necessary possibly makes quite more sense than  purely searching for "excitedness".	2017-03-15 22:40:29Z	JI Xiang
11469	The eventual goal out of depression should be the restoring of chemical balance etc., not exactly some potentially harmful "source of excitement" imo. Of course you might have already known that. Just a comment here.	2017-03-15 22:43:01Z	JI Xiang

11465	This is the wrong forum to ask these type of questions. My piece of advice to you is to find a better doctor. So many local doctors have no idea what to do when they encounter a not so common issue. health.clevelandclinic.org/2015/07/…	2017-03-10 22:57:42Z	KCasper
11464	In what Country do you live? Usually all doctors have to abide to confidentially, and as an example, in Germany, if anyone gossips about your health, they loose their approbation and go to jail most of the time. Is detailed conversation about medical issues conversation in medical terms or really just gossip? If this is the later, change your doctor.	2017-03-08 06:09:35Z	Narusan-in-coma
11464	But, you have to trust your dentist and need to tell him/her all medication you take! Serious medication interaction effects can happen with almost any medication if you mix the wrong ones. Ever tried alcohol and sleeping pills?	2017-03-08 06:11:19Z	Narusan-in-coma
11464	@Narusan however, dentists do not normally administer or prescribe alcohol or sleeping pills. I believe the OP is specifically asking about cases where there are no meaningful or significant interactions. In theory, anything could affect anything else, but doctors don't need a comprehensive list of every time you have ever had a cold before diagnosing a rash, since the likelihood of that affecting the outcome is virtually nil. Similarly, astronauts in Florida don't refuse to take off unless given a copy of the weather report for Istanbul.	2017-03-08 18:56:18Z	Robert Columbia
11464	@RobertColumbia: The point I'm trying to make is that there is a good reason why doctors want to know what medication you are taking. We don't know all interactions of all medication, so we can not give an exclusive list of which are "harmless". Sleeping pills are not, as I have just shown with this example. Neither are pain killers nor headache pills.	2017-03-08 19:12:47Z	Narusan-in-coma
11464	The point I'm trying to make: Your dentist does not need to know your full health background. Unless they are narcotising you, they don't need to know which surgeries you underwent. However, always give them a complete list of the pills you are taking. If you do not trust your doctor enough to do this, go to another one, as the patient-doctor relationship is clearly broken there.	2017-03-08 19:15:18Z	Narusan-in-coma

11458	Asking about "marriage life" is what makes your question off topic. If you rephrase your question to be about fertility specifically, then we can answer from biology and the answer is: nothing long term. For males, in the very short term semen volume can be reduced, but this is a very temporary problem. For females, there is no problem.	2017-03-07 19:34:37Z	
11458	You'll note that there are already plenty of ressources on the subject online. In short, masturbation (for both males and females) is completely harmless to the extent that it becomes too obsessive (such as 20 times a day).	2017-03-07 19:34:42Z	Remi.b
11458	@Remi.b I think your last comment is very misleading. "Harmless" is way too subjective, and your claim [although it's just a comment] lacks evidence. Masturbation can cause physical damage to tissues and it can influence psychology and sexual behavior. I would think that the various ways that people find to masturbate as well as the variation in demeanor or overall psychological well-being of each individual would make it fairly difficult to simply say that it is "harmless" w/out more info.  20x/day is also an arbitrary threshold :p. Overall, though, I agree this would be better on Health.SE.	2017-03-07 20:32:48Z	theforestecologist

After going to the hospital and getting other things taken care of, a dental student sealed it. The sealant did crack and fall out later.  Since then my dentist asks if I want it fixed, but since it isn't a cutting hazard and I'm keeping it clean they said its only a cosmetic issue.

11390	For quaker oatmeal, the serving sizes are the same.  For cheerios, the honey nut serving size is 25% smaller than the plain serving size, so that the total calories are the same.    That only accounts for half of the difference in iron content.   Also if you look at iron content per gram of complex carbohydrate that's 30% higher in cheerios than in in honey nut cheerios.

This i assumed was a muscle-in-recovery thing and will go away with time, but i have doubts about this now since being informed of the shorter bone. This limp was definitely never ever there before the accident. thnx	2017-03-01 10:57:19Z	
11360	I'd definitely go for a second and even a third opinion if need be - it can't hurt and it is really difficult to say over the internet what is the best course of action. The limp sounds a bit odd for such a "small" difference in length, but it doesn't have to mean that the difference is larger, your gait patter may not have recovered fully yet. I would suggest slightly editing your question so it doesn't get closed as personal medical advice - e.g. instead of asking if your case was malpractice you can ask for the statistics on how common this complication occurs with your type of surgery.	2017-03-01 11:10:45Z	Lucky

You could rephrase this question to ask about Hepatolithiasis treatments in general, but not for the purpose of getting advice. Also, part of how SE works is that you need to explain what you understand from trying to read about it yourself, and then ask what you want to know to complete your knowledge.  Your question shows no evidence of trying to find answers on your own, which I imagine you did do.	2017-02-25 02:30:08Z	DoctorWhom

11295	Welcome to health SE :-). We can't really answer whether you injured yourself, a doctor can answer that after a physical examination and possibly some form of imaging. This is why your question has been marked as off topic. We can however  answer what type of doctor is most likely to help you (and you have already got a great answer on that). If you would like your question to remain open, please edit out the parts asking for personal medical advice. P.S. It is absolutely possible to sustain an injury due to repetitive movements, do see a doctor ASAP.	2017-02-25 06:58:41Z	Lucky
11292	Neurological changes like numbness are generally things a physician should evaluate.  There is no way to tell whether it is concerning without an exam.  Then he/she would be able to direct your proper treatment regimen and prevention of your pain and stiffness, such as physical therapy, appropriate stretches/exercises, heat or ice, massage, etc.  It depends on what specifically is wrong.	2017-02-25 02:35:23Z	DoctorWhom

11290	@CareyGregory I posted it on the Biology feed too.	2017-02-24 05:50:01Z	
11290	Not a formal answer, but there is a process (I have seen the awesome end product from it) where they inject a resin into the vasculature that then solidifies, and then they remove all the organic tissue from around it, and you are left with the branching "tree" of blood vessels.  I saw one from the ventricles of the brain too, in our gross anatomy course.  If you wanted the vessels themselves still intact, I can't think of any chemical or physiologic way to differentiate the vessels enough from the myocardium and cardiac connective tissue to selectively dissolve everything but the vessels...	2017-02-24 06:14:13Z	DoctorWhom

It represents a lack of complete understanding about how pathogens invade the body and how the immune system works. A strictly biological answer could fill in the gaps of understanding while answering the [admittedly health-oriented main] question.

11249	No, it's an upper airway sound. It is often caused by a 'fluid' in the trachea or large airways, like mucus. Ronchi clear with coughing (in fact, physicians often ask the patient to cough, so they can then listen to the lungs without the loud, sonorous ronhci). Small airway sounds do not clear with coughing.	2017-02-22 21:45:17Z	anongoodnurse

We can't challenge or override your doctor's decision over the internet - having seen and examined you in person, your doctor has a much better insight in your condition that we do.

11203	I'm going to follow up to what @Lucky said, and say that if you have any problem with advice given to you by your doctor, the internet isn't the place to go for answers, ask another doctor! Doctors often consult with other doctors when they need advice, and second opinions are an option that you should always feel is available when you need it! That being said, if a few doctors say the same thing, you can generally be quite sure they know what they're talking about. Medications often do many different things in many different people, which is why it takes years of training to become a doctor.	2017-02-24 18:40:49Z	TheEnvironmentalist

Although the question, as it is written is a general one, you are in fact asking because you need personal medical advice and we shouldn't provide that over the internet. What made you think that thickening of your toenail was diet-related in the first place? If you have some research to support your assumption, we can comment on that. Otherwise this question is sending us on a wild goose chase. The best way for you to get an answer would be to see a doctor.	2017-06-04 12:55:45Z	Lucky

11190	It is a lovely and a very noble idea. However, this is my opinion and the question whether the idea is good is a primarily opinion based one. You could rephrase your question to ask for scientific evidence on what are the most important questions or the most common issues that dementia patients are struggling with, that could be helped by constant repetition through your game. We can't know if something is too advanced for your programming skills, however there are serious ethical implications with collecting data from the patients. That would make an excellent separate question. Best of luck!	2017-02-18 23:41:51Z	Lucky
11188	It is possible for you to have an ECG with no rhythm issues but have rate issues.

Medically it is not that interesting (some women don't have hymen, in others it "breaks" when they use a tampon. besides, most doctors don't medically care about the cultural aspect of virginity), but culturally it can be.

11104	I am not going to answer as I don't have source.  Yes fresh is better.  A freezer is not going to produce vitamins.  That said a frozen vegetable is still very healthy in the overall range of food products.   It is probably only behind fresh vegetable.	2017-02-13 22:16:28Z	Paparazzi
11104	Probably for the same reason that frozen seafood is often better than fresh: time. Frozen produce is often picked, cleaned and frozen all in one day, just as seafood is often cleaned and frozen right on board the fishing vessel that caught it. Fresh produce, on the other hand, will likely have been picked more than 24 hours before you buy it.

11102	@Jan I searched this site and was not able to find a question about daily water intake for a 30 year old male. Could you point me to any that are on this site? I don't see it being repeated.

11098	Terminating a pregnancy is an abortion. There is nothing less than "outright." It's also a potentially dangerous procedure no matter how it's done, so don't even think about some home baked method you hear about on the internet if you value your wife's life. You can find out if your wife is pregnant by visiting a doctor or clinic that provides such services. There is no other way to confirm it other than waiting for the proof of her swelling belly.	2017-02-09 16:55:29Z	Carey Gregory
11098	There are ECPs (emergency contraception pills) but the longest of these are only effective for up to 120 hours after the deed. You're way past that. You will need to confirm the pregnancy and then seek professional medical advice. There is a chance your wife's symptoms are psychosomatic in nature, but a testing kit is the first stage to working out what happens next.	2017-02-09 21:58:51Z	Snow
11097	What did your (or high street) optician say?	2017-02-09 11:21:20Z	Snow
11097	i didnt speak to them yet to be honest. but i did ask a few years ago if my vision was okay to drive (this was a hospital optician, not a high street one) and he said "yeah should be".	2017-02-09 23:55:00Z	
11097	The only real way of finding out your options is to see an optician.  They will be able to test your prescription to see if an adjustment is needed.  They will also be able to advise on contact lenses.	2017-02-10 00:10:13Z	Chris
11082	In addition to Carey Gregory's answer, even if you have a medicine that works for you, you probably need to have periodical checkups with your doctor. You can tell them about your progress and about the medication you have taken (the type, amount and frequency) and they can tell you if you are taking too much.	2017-02-16 06:43:45Z	Lucky
11082	@Lucky thanks, but doctor's here are not as good as London's. I was disappointed about doctors so i started to take this myself. Tried many medications before.	2017-02-16 08:07:41Z	
11071	Also, for a very practical answer to your question --- just use a Q-tip or cotton swab with water and soap on it and wiggle it around to loosen up the dirt and pull out the yuck. It's actually really effective --- I never thought about it or tried until yesterday when I saw this post. haha.	2017-02-23 21:08:45Z	Butterfly and Bones

11034	Yes, really. Those words have no medical definitions but that's what you're asking for. They're slang terms that vary in usage from person to person and region to region. If you say them to a medical professional, they'll have to question you further to find out what you actually mean. So I don't know how you expect us to provide definitions for them when they don't have definitions beyond whatever you can find in a dictionary.	2017-02-04 20:32:18Z	Carey Gregory

10993	This article gives a list of vegetables and their nicotine content	2017-01-30 22:59:42Z	Chris
10993	Thanks. So what is a "passive smoker", as mentioned in the article? I must be reading the data wrong because that would mean that one eggplant weighing 100 grams would be equivalent to 10 cigarettes worth of nicotine. That can't be true. Am I understanding the data correctly?	2017-01-31 06:32:38Z	
10993	I understood it the same as you.  The article compares the amount of nicotine in food to being in a room with 1 or 2 smokers (moderate smoke in the room) breathing in their smoke but not smoking yourself	2017-01-31 09:06:21Z	Chris
10993	So, in a day, if I eat a potato, tomato, some eggplant, tea, and chocolate, that must be equivalent to 2 packs of cigarettes. So why don't people just eat a lot of tomatoes instead of smoking?	2017-01-31 09:42:45Z	
10993	I have a hard time believing the info in the article because then we would all be overdosing on nicotine just from eating salads and potatoes.	2017-01-31 13:36:06Z

10989	I don't understand what you're asking. Since you've got enough rep on stackexchange to cast close votes, I'm sure you understand what I mean when I say the question is unclear, too broad, and primarily opinion based. That's the trifecta of close reasons.	2017-02-01 05:17:07Z	Carey Gregory
10989	There are really too many variables for us to say what might be helping you with this diet. Apart from that, the energy intake is not the only aspect of food you should consider; fiber and nutrients are important. So is your intake of water and exercise. But I can help with units of energy - it refers to kcal/g i.e. kilocalories (also known as food calories) per gram.	2017-02-01 15:12:53Z	Lucky
10989	I've lost 8 kilos so far, and not losing more at the moment. But I'm still feeling my body is transforming. If this diet works for you, please upvote the question just to situate myself. I'm going to start combining some exercise to my diet now.	2017-03-29 23:24:44Z	
10986	Many years ago, we called this "Wellness Medicine." I think today it's settled down into "Preventive Medicine". You're a lot less likely to come across quacks in preventive medicine than in wellness medicine. Maybe better answered on Health.SE?	2017-01-29 15:57:04Z	anongoodnurse
10986	It is a mix.  I would go with personal trainer / dietitian.	2017-01-30 00:31:53Z	Paparazzi
10986	The problem here is that the scientific results obtained so far are not good enough. It's one thing to say that half an hour per day of moderate exercise is recommended and to back that up with scientific studies, but to say that X minutes per day at intensity Y is optimal requires a lot more knowledge (and X and Y will obviously vary from person to person and change as the person gets fitter) that simply doesn't exist at the moment.	2017-01-30 01:38:30Z	Count Iblis

10899	Not necessary heart attack, but "heart-related chest pain" or "angina pectoris" due to "ischemic heart disease" is one of the possible causes. Such pain is triggered by exercise and stress and tends to radiate down the left arm. If this what she experienced is different or worse from what she usually feels, she should maybe go to a cardiologist and do some tests. A primary doctor can be a good start. It sounds nothing like stroke. It could be just heartburn due to acid reflux. People here do not like to take responsibility for something what might be potentially a serious condition.	2017-01-21 12:21:37Z	Jan

10892	After the edit the question is much clearer, but I would suggest being as specific as possible and ask directly your question from this comment, i.e. are there other therapeutic options or is the same type of medication being made by another manufacturer at a lower price.

10851	Unfortunately we can't really say over the internet what it is with certainty nor can we offer a solution. The only thing we can recommend is that you be persistent in asking for a solution from medical professionals in person - if one can't help, try looking for a second (or third) opinion.	2017-01-20 16:26:57Z	Lucky
10851	Thanks for the help lucky, unfortunately all the professional advice I've seeked out have come back as uncertain also. Each have provided a solution very different from the last. Since this is the case, I would prefer to take the routes with as little side effects as possible first before going to the more extreme options. So far I have tried creams, cleansers, vitamins and minerals. Is there any of these you would recommend?	2017-01-22 11:17:24Z

10842	I agree with your comment, and sorry: I guess my question was too specific.  I didn't want a diagnoses; I'm just wondering if drop attacks tend to reoccur or generally are a one-time thing.  For example: tourette syndrome tends to get milder or go away with age. But no where on the internet can I find documentation as to whether ANY drop attack reoccurs ever, regardless of the diagnoses, and if so, how often (twice in a lifetime, once per week, etc.).  Perhaps some are sporadic, some are a one time event and some are frequent?  I can't find any info on the internet.	2017-01-18 04:07:13Z	
10842	I have completely redone the question, I hope that makes it more answerable.	2017-01-18 04:34:08Z

10805	Your body temperature doesn't rise. Sweat doesn't necessarily indicate higher body temp. It also occurs as a response to cardiac problems and vagal responses. The vagal response probably explains what you're asking about.	2017-01-13 16:26:22Z	Carey Gregory
10796	The only reason I can think of for a follow-up colonoscopy is to ensure the excised polyp has healed properly and that the clip (or staple) dislodged completely. I just had a stomach ulcer clipped and have to go back for a follow-up endoscopy for that reason.	2017-01-12 19:56:12Z	BillDOe

10761	Hey there Arturino, welcome to Health SE! I noticed your question and wanted to offer you a suggestion, if I may. You reference RGP as a possible treatment for cervical myelopathy. After a quick search I can tell you that I can't seem to find any references to a treatment called RGP in the scientific literature, beyond the rgp series of viral env proteins which have fairly little to do with myelopathy. If you could provide a bit more context, you'd be far more likely to receive a helpful answer. You would also be asking a question much more likely to help future generations of Health SE users.	2017-01-10 09:44:01Z	TheEnvironmentalist

10760	Since their brain has never learned what the colors look like (i.e. it has no references), I doubt very much that a color blind individual could dream in color. I'd also expect that a totally blind person could only dream within the world their brain has become familiar with, and therefore, not actually dream in images.	2017-01-09 21:03:57Z	BillDOe
10760	Complete color blindness is very rare. Most color blind individuals are either red-green color blind or blue-yellow, meaning they can see colors but they have difficulty distinguishing between colors in those spectrums.	2017-01-09 23:46:41Z	Carey Gregory

10706	I think this question belongs more to the SeasonedAdvice part of this website. I think, from the health perspective, there should not be any important difference between the bag with or without air around the meat. There will be more bacteria on the meat surface than in the air in the bag, anyway. The problem could be that the air left in the bag contains some  moisture, which would freeze on the surface of the meat and eventually change the taste or texture of the meat. Again, cooks should know better...	2017-01-03 21:40:38Z	Jan
10706	Yeah, definitely not a health question. You can freeze food in no wrappers at all and it will be perfectly safe. Dried out and ruined within days, but safe for years.Seasoned Advice is definitely where you want to ask this.	2017-01-04 04:51:53Z	Carey Gregory

10685	The only reason to withhold water from an injured person is because they may not be fully conscious, or may lose consciousness, and the water presents a choking and/or vomiting risk. But if they are fully conscious then they need water even more than an uninjured person does. They have, after all, suffered a significant loss of blood, which is mostly water and that needs to be replaced. The person who said it will dilute their blood is utterly clueless.	2017-01-09 23:51:30Z	Carey Gregory

10682	@CareyGregory As i mentioned in the post, it was the doctor who insisted on a hearing test each time. Yes, i can get a second opinion, but what is the point if another doctor is just going to do the same thing?

10677	I know he needs to see a doctor. The problem is that I can't get him to go see one. He thinks that a doctor, or medication will immpead his ability to perform his important work (saving the universe, physics, etc). He is too delusional, too detached from reality to know that he is sick and needs help. He has no family. The police won't do anything because he is not an IMMEDIATE threat to himself or others. The guy that was taking care of him just bailed out last night, packed up his stuff and moved, so now my friend is alone with no one to help him support himself. I know he can't live ther	2017-01-02 15:24:20Z

I'm asking what can I do to help him get the help that he needs? I don't know what I should/can do? What is a good jumping off point? Can someone with experience give me any advice on a first step I can take to improve my friends health and life? Living with me is not an option. I have two kids and a very small apartment, and from a financial standpoint I cannot make any changes in my living conditions, or provide him with any.	2017-01-02 15:25:37Z	
10677	Get a social worker involved. But people like this end up on the street because they refuse help.	2017-01-02 17:25:02Z	Graham Chiu
10677	I'm sorry to hear you are going through this.  If you feel he is an immediate/impending threat to himself or others (like you said you think it's changed since the court ruling), you can call the police/ambulance as @L.B. states. If they feel he is, they can put a mandatory psych hold and he will be evaluated by psychiatrists.  In OHIO, 211 is a great option - they have crisis counseling and could also advise you.  In case you're hesitant to call the police. Tell them the situation. If your friend denies suicidality when asked, however, it's possible he might not be held.	2017-01-21 15:48:47Z	DoctorWhom

10676	Yes, that's exactly right. Portability is a implicit and fundamental requirement for the question. Maybe there are brushing options that are relevant here. I hadn't thought to look them up.	2017-07-04 23:43:48Z	
10676	This is an excellent question! Yes mint can relax the lower esophageal sphincter whether gum or candy form, contributing to reflux. I have looked some into this and have not found good written/internet resources yet, but have spoken with faculty physicians.   Recommendations included drinking sufficient water, following GERD recommendations (as your reflux can contribute to bad breath) including sufficient fruits/vegetables, brushing your tongue, and general oral hygiene. I'm not writing this as an answer because I don't have written resources for it, but will look.	2017-08-29 08:03:23Z	DoctorWhom

However for me I feel that is not okay for fine-works in nearby-distance,   like thin-sectioning and dissecting tiniest objects. Putting off the glass improve vision for them. Also sometimes putting off the glasses to read nearby-things, gives me more comfort (less-stress). So I could feel what you're exactly trying to tell.	2017-01-02 19:05:35Z	Always Confused

10495	I know it's not what you are asking about, but are all other factors completely excluded? The thing I would suspect first would be a concomitant use of another medicine coincidentally introduced around the same time as the generic drug. Variations in metabolism and plasma protein binding may be an explanation if that is the case. Take a look at this: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23116430	2016-12-16 12:26:08Z	Lucky
10495	@Lucky, thanks for your comment. Of course your suggestion could explain the situation. However, I do not have all the details about the entire treatment plan of the patient. At any rate, since the discussion focuses on the difference of clinical result between different formulations of Clopidogrel, let's assume this is the only medication she receives (or that no significant drug interactions were identified).	2016-12-16 13:51:10Z

10426	I think that Kate covered the most relevant issue - privacy in the answer below, but I can't help but wonder: even if the doctor is asking you to save time, why do you automatically assume that they are being lazy? The doctor's time costs a lot of money and regardless of the healthcare system financing method it is ultimately your money. (E.g. if you have a state budged financed health system you are paying for it each time you pay taxes - if you want the amount of time the doctor has to spend on you to increase, the taxes have to increase as well.)	2016-12-15 01:28:11Z	Lucky
10426	As Kate explained there is nothing simple about looking it up in a database. My point wasn't to try and answer the question, but rather say that healthcare professionals are not malicious slaking devils who are out to get you; they are genuinely trying to help. If they can't the first thing that comes to mind is not that they won't, but rather that there is a reasonable explanation why they can't. If you work with your doctor instead of against them you will be better off in the long run. Your health is your and the doctor's common goal.	2016-12-16 23:42:46Z	Lucky

10380	@CareyGregory - While I understand (And agree as a programmer), many open source (i.e. free) software packages make very good money selling support packages for free software. Install, maintenance, etc. Also, many free EMR or similar type management software packages are free for basic items (Which might be suitable for a one doc practice), and then charge for extra packages (Metrics, things like that). Or the package is free for up to 50 patients, beyond that you have to pay.	2016-12-10 14:57:02Z	JohnP

10353	After death all the muscles of the body relax, including the sphincter muscles that keep your bowels and bladder from leaking. It wouldn't be in the least bit surprising to find that someone lost a few grams at the moment of death when their bowels and/or bladder emptied themselves. The doctor named in the Wikipedia article should have known that.	2016-12-05 21:38:05Z	Carey Gregory

10328	That would depend on the terms of your insurance policy, but dermatologists are specialists so I would imagine the answer is yes. I don't think we can answer it any better than that since it's more of a legal/insurance question rather than medical.	2016-12-02 23:09:56Z	Carey Gregory
10328	Yep. Your insurance contract decides what is and isn't a specialist visit. This is one way they limit people's use of services that are by nature ongoing--mental health counseling, physical therapy, etc. They don't say "we don't cover this;" they simply charge a large co-pay. They refer to "office visit" rather than using the words "physician" or "doctor." Insurance is a separate issue, though, from the oversight that the physician has over the treatments. Be informed and confident that the person administering your treatments knows what they are doing.	2016-12-07 02:39:31Z	Katherine Lockwood
10328	@KatherineLockwood the doctor overseeing the treatment is considered a leading expert in the field, and the use instructions for the assistant administering the treatment are as simple as typing in the dosage in the doctor's prewritten treatment plan, and hitting the start button. I'm assuming the assistant is paid around $25 an hour, and the electricity for the machine can't cost more than 50¢, so my five minutes there costs them under $1, and I pay over $70 for it AFTER insurance. That's what bothers me.	2017-01-08 08:15:00Z

10312	Until I can collect some studies of the subject, my advice would be this:  states of mind are tools, and should be used as such.  There are several techniques to improve concentration and conceptualization of mathematical and similarly discrete problems.  From my observations, cannabis doesn't make people into stoners:  it increases the appeal of certain activities and lifestyles, and it is the habituation with those activities which produces the malaise linked with cannabis use or misuse.	2017-04-26 01:16:20Z	can-ned_food
10311	Welcome to health SE :-). It is always a problem when one sees many doctors and still doesn't have the answer, for a question that can only be answered by a physician, in person. Both of your symptoms should be taken seriously by your medical team, especially given their persistence and worsening over the years. In my personal experience, doctors do tend to take pain more seriously than other symptoms, so during your next visit you might lead with that. A journal in which you would record your symptoms every day for a period of time might also be helpful.	2016-12-01 14:08:10Z	Lucky

10276	This may depend on the type of the product - sustained release products don't release the whole dose at once (but they don't release the substances over a week either). It also depends on the substance that crosses the RDA threshold and whether it is a hydrosoluble or a liposoluble one. We do need more detail to answer. You can always edit your question to add some.

10226	No, more effective was the first thing that came to my mind, I just wanted to check. There are some cases in which fuzzy drinks should be avoided (e.g. in people at risk of osteoporosis), but that is a completely different thing, so leaving the meaning completely open would make a question to broad. But the question of effectiveness is a great one, because one has to balance the stability of vit C in a solution against the improved absorption rate.

You should include the actual question (what are the possible side effects of too much pain killers) and also add details about what sort of medicine it is and what you consider to be "too much", so that we could answer your question. Personal medical advice is strictly off-topic for this site so you should edit out personal medical history. Otherwise your question looks like you are asking for diagnosis and it will probably be closed as off-topic. Thanks!	2016-11-28 16:05:58Z	Lucky

10206	Thanks for the link. My understanding is that pulsatile tinnitus and the other kinds of tinnitus have [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3719451/](quite different causes), and for that reason I think I'd need a paper that referenced the prevalence of pulsatile tinnitus specifically.	2016-11-23 23:42:10Z

10201	Building muscle cannot be compared to ingesting small doses of toxins. They don't compare at all in any way. Would you also care to share some of this evidence that taking small doses of toxins does anything other than poison you just a little bit at a time? Because if your premise is false, your question has no merit.	2016-11-22 05:16:16Z	Carey Gregory
10201	@CareyGregory - if your premise about my premise is false, your comment has no merit. Microdosing poison, which is more toxic than alcohol, has been proven to build poison resistance, this is also how antivenom is produced commercially. I don't know about alcohol, so I am asking. And with that, I will stop stating the obvious.	2016-11-22 13:44:35Z	
10201	Now the not so obvious - every organ has its function. For the liver it is to metabolize stuff, for the muscles it is to contract, for the bone it is to give structural integrity. If you systematically contract the muscle in a controlled manner, the muscle gets stronger, if you systematically micro-fracture a bone in a controlled manner, the bone gets stronger. It appears that when it comes to certain types of poison and venom, the same is true for the liver. Training works the muscle, ingesting toxins works the liver, so I'd say that you can compare working to working.	2016-11-22 14:06:27Z

Their reaction appears to be an issue of colloquial usage of terminology vs true definition, as >70% of dwarfism is due to achondroplasia - which has a more common presentation and therefore is easily generalized.  As for why there's societal stigmatization of physical/psychological differences, that's its own discussion, a tragic flaw of humanity.

10149	I hope you have sought help, and am sorry you are experiencing such tough times. I agree with seeing psychology and working regularly with them. But in addition to counseling, for some conditions, medication may add additional help and support - for example depression or anxiety, of which you describe several symptoms.  Your psychologist can help diagnose you, but to prescribe it, you would need to see a healthcare provider such as your Primary Care Provider or a Psychiatrist.	2017-01-21 14:36:23Z	DoctorWhom

10159	If air quality monitoring stations measure these concentrations at street level, the concentrations at your air inlet are not necessarily equal. You can expect (depending on the street canyon!) dillution of the NOx concentrations with increasing height and distance to the street. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate, how you will be impacted in your flat. Having said that: you might travel through this and similar streets at rush hour. It might be that your NOx intake during these journeys is higher than during the time staying in your flat. (But it might be also the other way around).	2016-11-16 13:24:58Z

Recent studies suggest that ultrafine particles may be the real problem living near highways.    bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/04/…   As to specifics on how dangerous something is, the risk assessment is very difficult to put numbers to.

10120	Is there any scientific evidence that there is a health benefit from (1) performing 30 minutes of exercise a day; (2) moving around / burning a certain number of calories a day; (3) standing for one minute every hour; or (4) taking deep breaths for a minute every four hours?  Citations to scientific papers would be helpful.	2016-11-16 14:42:13Z	
10113	The question you need to be asking is how long it takes to leave your stomach, not how long it takes to be absorbed. Once it leaves the stomach and enters the duodenum, it's no longer subject to being vomited up. In general most pills will dissolve and leave the stomach in less than 2 hours, but that's just a general guideline. I would suggest calling the local pharmacy, speak to the pharmacist and ask them if it's okay to crush the pill and dissolve it in water. That would significantly speed passage out of the stomach. Taking it on an empty stomach speeds it up too.	2016-11-15 02:19:51Z	Carey Gregory
10113	@CareyGregory  Good comment.  You should turn it into an answer.  I would also say gastric emptying time can be very long for some people.  If you settle a "leaving the stomach" limit to two hours, you'll be quite safe, though.  Some drugs are absorbed in the jejunum, the ileum or even the colon, but that doesn't matter in this case as the drug will way down in the digestive system.	2016-11-15 11:36:01Z	Centaurus

What I can say, though, is that the recommendation is that if traditional speech therapy methods have been unsuccessful, there is some research that less traditional methods (ultrasound is a good example) can sometimes help. Also, I have never heard the term "rhotacism." In teens and adults who don't have a typical r sound, most US SLPs would call this a "residual r error," in the absence of any structural or functional problem.	2016-11-14 01:42:53Z	Katherine Lockwood

10030	I don't have any definite reference, but based on my own experience, I would name two main reasons: the first, publishing in "traditional" journals is usually free of charge, while publishing in open-access journals can cost the author hundreds to thousands of US dollars (example). The second, the presumption or perception that open-access is less prestigious and "doesn't count" for one's academic progress. I would also add a third one, which may simply be ignorance of the concept.	2017-08-22 04:53:25Z	Don_S

You can classify them together or individually.	2016-11-10 18:03:44Z	Prince
10026	Thanks. Sorry for lack of information. Short term effects I'd mean immediate neurological or cardiovascular benefits  (example). Long term effects I mean would it slowly boost your body's immune system in some way or another? Perhaps decrease likelihood of a stroke (again these are examples, I doubt a cold shower everyday would decrease your chance of having a stroke)	2016-11-10 18:24:48Z

10020	PAs work under a physician, and receive intensive practical instruction on top of their academic course work.  After the 2-years, they often further enter into fellowships, and work within one field of medicine (including general practice/internal medicine which seems to be the direction you are hinting). I don't think a several medical texts will get you to 70-80% ready (at best 30-40%).

We also don't directly absorb precisely what we eat, things get preprocessed, so the equation is not as simple as eat A, absorb A.	2016-11-06 19:29:25Z	mismas
9959	@mismas: Since food is part of this buffer mechanism, "no, no, and hell no" could be a but misleading, but I assume you just wanted to emphasize that it is a bit more complex ;).	2017-10-07 14:20:38Z	bluenote10
9959	Actually, the buffer mechanisms are the carbonic acid/bicarb system (by far the most influential), the phospate buffer, and the protein buffer (the protein being mainly haemoglobin). Alkaline veggies are not directly involved.	2017-10-07 18:53:59Z	mismas
9957	Welcome to health SE :-). That's an interesting question. I've edited out the thanks, it's sort of a rule on SE and created a pulse tag, I hope that you don't mind. For more information on the site you can take our tour or visit the help center and Health Meta. I hope we'll see more questions (and perhaps answers) from you.	2016-11-06 14:07:53Z	Lucky
9956	The question is interesting, but the example is off - medicines are intended to help and sometimes unfortunately have undesired effects (called side or adverse effects) when they are used. Heroin, on the other hand, is always abused; all effects that it has can be considered to be side-effects from a medical point of view. Note that mental health is also an important aspect of health - the addiction itself is a mental illness caused by heroin. In the article you linked: "I somehow manage to function. [...] I despise being an addict."	2016-11-06 13:55:58Z	Lucky

9919	Yes. You will usually be lucky but better to rinse it in tap water at least. There is a big difference between falling on the kitchen counter and falling on the dive bar bathroom floor.	2017-04-14 23:12:34Z	Chloe

9910	This obviously isn't all of it (since the dentist said it would melt) but part of this is also because if you have some form of wound that requires sutures in your mouth; eating hot food can also cause swelling and added pain.	2016-11-03 15:59:41Z	L.B.
9910	The main reason for my question is that I don't know whether my "warm" definition is cool enough. I am eating completely cold meals as a result. Main problem is the cooling time.	2016-11-03 16:27:25Z

9898	What do you mean by "pheromones"? It is a very generic catch-all term and everybody defines it differently. Also, even in normal-smelling people, not everybody can smell the same compounds, so the question seems rather unanswerable.	2016-11-04 22:32:33Z	rumtscho
9893	Are you asking about the portion of our genome which has been created by viruses? There's certainly plenty of sections of the human genome that is from viruses. Or are you talking about transplacental infection, as in a baby fetus is infected by a virus but the mother house (Ziika being the hot topic at the moment).	2016-12-03 02:40:12Z	Atl LED
9893	@AtlLED A viral infection is just the physiological manifestation of a virus injecting genetic material into a cell's genome. If this cell happens to exist in the offspring, then the offspring will "inherit" the virus, as in an ovum is infected and then the viral genetics are part of the offspring from conception	2016-12-03 17:47:03Z

9838	Welcome to health SE :-). This is a very interesting question, but it appears rather broad to me. It might be better if you could specify the methods that you would like to get the answers about. Or are you asking for any method substantiated by scientific research? Also, I don't see how the link you provided relates to your question. If you could link the specific page about memory and concentration exercises, that would help. Thanks!	2016-10-30 22:53:11Z	Lucky
9838	@Lucky I've edited the title to make it more precise. By scientific ways I mean natural ways that are scientifically approved.

9812	Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine developed during antiquity and the medieval period, and as such is comparable to pre-modern Chinese and European systems of medicine. Although laboratory experiments suggest it is possible that some substances in Ayurveda might be developed into effective treatments, there is no evidence that any are effective as currently proffered. Ayurveda medicine is considered pseudoscientific	2016-10-31 16:05:59Z	JJosaur

9800	ECT is a very effective treatment for chronic major depression that has not responded adequately to other treatment approaches. Psychologists are not medical doctors and do not provide ECT.

9783	Still can't crack my skull open for that. Have you read Oliver Sacks: "An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales"? The start of ch "A Surgeon’s Life" (about someone with TS) might help to refine the Q here. – Are they missing the whole picture, dismiss the diagnosis, maltreat the child or you? There seems to be a problem, but I do not grasp it, yet.	2017-12-15 15:27:06Z	LangLangC
9783	@LangLangC - Sure, they've made my life miserable, but that's not the point.  They make the child's life miserable.  They send him to the back of the room, to the hall, to the principal's office, they scold him, they humiliate him.  They do not understand his condition.  Yes, Sacks' writing and videos about Tourette have been very helpful for me.  School personnel have not been willing to spend much time learning about Tourette -- they're not going to give Sacks' work the time of day.  Does that help you understand my request for an analogy?

9762	Hey, Jack, I'm hearing impaired, and wear hearing aids. Feel free to edit your post and tag it as "deaf," "hearing-aids," "hearing-impaired," "audiology," etc. This will draw more individuals to your post that can answer your question.

9749	@CareyGregory -- I'd like to refer you to health.stackexchange.com/questions/9514/… so you know what treatments I've tried.... and that, they actually are not effective for everyone. Just because they are effective for you, doesn't mean it works for everyone. I have seen a dermatologist for over 20 years, but thanks for your advice? Why wouldn't hydrogen-peroxide work if it kills bacteria?	2016-10-25 23:21:28Z	
9749	Hydrogen peroxide kills living cells. It doesn't distinguish between bacteria and your own skin cells, which is why it's not recommended as a wound cleanser. It will likely do more harm than good. Second, the bacteria causing the acne aren't superficial, so the peroxide won't even reach them. Sorry dermatology hasn't been able to help you. I do hope you've seen more than one if the treatments have been ineffective. I assume you've tried them all because there are several.	2016-10-26 00:42:16Z	Carey Gregory

9689	Write things down.	2016-11-21 11:58:27Z	JJosaur
9689	This isn't a full answer, so I'm not going to treat it as one, but have you considered that you might not be paying attention in the first place? Often times, you'll have a conversation you really don't care about, and so you won't remember anything because you were really just a bystander in your own conversation. This is the same reason students have so much trouble remembering what they are taught in school. If you have no interest in chemistry, differentiating octets from orbitals is going to take conscious effort. I'm not saying it's definitely the answer, but there's my fifty cents.	2016-11-21 17:00:59Z	TheEnvironmentalist

9650	Do the math. 100 kg is 8.3 kg per month, which might be possible the first few months for someone starting out at 200 kg, but continuing that rate of weight loss for 12 months would be an astonishing feat. There is no diet that will achieve that without being very unhealthy and probably dangerous.	2016-10-19 14:09:58Z	Carey Gregory
9646	Welcome to health SE :-). Could you find a source for the link between fear of pain and skin disorders? Your research could give a good starting point to the users who would try to answer your question. Also, if you could make the first part a bit more general and not about yourself, it would make the question more on-topic, since as it is currently written it might be interpreted as asking for personal medical advice (which is off-topic here).

9634	@CountIblis Thank you. This is an interesting point but I am far from believing the result of only one study just because it respects the scientific methodology (but I suppose there are many studies on this). Of course, if done by respected people in the field, we may believe the result is right, but I think it is preferable to have different studies made by different people on the same subject before considering the results as "definitive".	2016-10-16 08:58:36Z	
9633	You mean with lower calorie intake. By definition food contains calories.	2016-10-17 04:59:21Z	Carey Gregory
9633	Low calory intake. What I meant was - given the energy expendited in chewing and digesting it can be even negative... Something I can eat habitually without gaining weight / body fat.	2016-10-17 10:22:03Z	
9633	Most vegetables are about as low in calories as you can get and still be eating real food. I seriously doubt it's possible to go negative.	2016-10-17 21:53:54Z	Carey Gregory

9609	The job: Teaching a class of 30 5-year olds. The crucial point: giving your all, 100% every second of the day, doing it all properly (if it were me, I'd take it easy at some point!). There is not one minute to have a calm thought all day, there's just a relentless barrage of incoming information or questions. The issue is constant mental processing, with no rest periods, even if seated. Once kids disappear there's a rush of paperwork and no let up in pace if all appropriate tasks are to be crammed into the day. Not everyone will work in this way, caring nothing for themself, but some do.	2017-01-28 18:35:47Z

9573	I'm no pathologist so I can't say for sure, but I suspect the answer would be that it could mean many things. From personal experience, I would treat any pathology report with vague language like that as highly suspicious and request a second opinion. I got a similar report on a biopsy from a dog once. It declared the cells normal but noted they had a "high mitotic rate." Yeah, they had a high mitotic rate alright because they were a very aggressive form of cancer the pathologist failed to identify.	2016-10-12 01:53:04Z	Carey Gregory

9539	This is super broad. When a Dietitian does an analysis they usually break down a diet into its "components" the Macronutrients (Carbohydrate, Fat, Protein, Alcohol) and its Micronutrients (Vitamins & Minerals), not food type. A better question might be aimed at specific processed food and its links to a specific health issue: "Does eating processed hamburgers lead to cancer?" as your question currently covers everything from chicken poppers to milkshakes and is too broad.	2016-10-10 12:03:32Z	JJosaur

In addition to that, the weight gain you mentioned in the question IS a serious health problem that can lead to diabetes, sleep apnea, etc. Being overweight (obese) is a serious health problem in and of itself.	2016-10-11 16:40:51Z	SnyperBunny

Or does the transvaginal ultrasound distinguish those better. ( I know a biopsy would be needed if there was a tumor, but I'm talking about the step before that).	2016-10-07 14:14:02Z

9528	It depends on the type of the burn (thermal, chemical, with what substance) etc. for the approach on the first aid. Later actions depend on several factors including your current state and the actions already taken. None of this can be assessed over the internet (which is why personal medical questions are off topic here). The person who can answer your questions is your doctor. For future reference, when you are in the lab and have an accident or a mishap, you should consult written first aid guidelines if there are some and your supervisor ASAP and if need be your doctor.

9514	@Jan, since the age of 10 (so that's 2/3rd's of my life), I obviously can't recall everything I've tried (mind you I've had a dermatologist this entire time). Just off the top of my head ACCUTANE! Spirnolactone, Minnocylin, Doxycycline, Tetracycline, low-dose birth control, clindamycin, erythromycin, Isotretinoin, Benzoyl peroxide, Salicylic acid, not to mention your topicals: Retin-A, Differin, Tazorac, Adapalene. Yes, and all those face-washes too: both prescription & OTC. You're not dealing with a teenager, I'm dead serious that I've tried EVERYTHING. Besides, that's not my question above^^	2016-10-06 17:21:36Z	
9514	@Jan, because space doesn't permit to write ALL my attempts of controlling acne off the top of my head: ProActiv, acne-cleansing wipes, make-up removal, applying make-up, sunscreen, lotion, that doesn't cause skin-break-out (as per my doctor's advice). Oh, and even desperate attempts at home remedies: egg-face-washing? hydrogen-peroxide washing? Toothpaste? Honey? Lemon Juice? Yogurt washing? Aloe Vera? Supplements: Omega 3 & Probiotics. I also have never consumed an iota of alcohol & coffee & I've eliminated caffeinated beverages & greasy foods (but I'm not sure that even does anything).	2016-10-06 17:38:35Z	
9514	@Jan, I don't meant to come off as aggressive, but I hope you can understand that after experiencing this for about 20 years, I hate it when people say "have you tried this?" or they act like treatment is so easy. Or that I am not aware of acne-causes? I have suffered (been a social outcast) because of my acne - I am very much aware of textbook acne triggers, but unfortunately, that's not my case! & people don't understand or aware that acne is genetic or caused by PCOS ( much harder to control). I shouldn't have to justify myself for the ? ^ - you're comment/answer is irrelevant & hurtful :(	2016-10-06 17:49:51Z

9495	It would help to define acceptable. Since the point in compressions is to force circulation, if you were able to do it with the right pressure area, depth and rate, anything would theoretically work.  But controlling depth/area with your foot may be more difficult, you may risk pushing too hard.  However, in the situation where you fatigue without anyone to relieve you, that is a good question. Ethically, I'd be all for doing it to keep the person alive.  Legally, I don't know if it would be considered doing CPR "the wrong way."

9363	@Lucky I was actually more to 1) than to 2). The OP assumes that if the chlorhexidine is OK, then the whole concoction is OK to drink. In reality, the tax model in many countries foresees that you only don't pay taxes when the alcohol is truly undrinkable. Then, if chlorhexidine is OK, there must be something else (not necessarily listed on the ingredients) which makes it unpleasant or even dangerous to drink, making a chlorhexidine-based answer misleading. At the same time, the price based reasoning requires knowledge of a legal system, not of anything medical, so not for us.	2016-09-30 07:14:13Z	rumtscho
9363	@rumtscho I see, that's a good point. But since chlorhexidine is actually not OK I guess that solves it. Still, I'll edit the answer just in case. Thanks!	2016-09-30 11:51:05Z	Lucky

Most of alternative detox methods do not eliminate any significant amount of metals, anyway.	2016-09-26 12:03:21Z	Jan
9360	Welcome to health SE :-). This is an interesting question (+1 from me), but would you mind rewording the part about detox having connotations of being stupid. It's not that I in essence don't agree that most of popular detox routines are not as miraculous as they claim to be, but the wording you used sounds a bit off. Thanks!	2016-09-27 00:45:51Z	Lucky
9360	@JJosaur if that were true, no one would ever have heavy metal poisoning, right? It depends very much on the extent of the exposure (i.e. concentration in the contaminated medium as well as route and duration of exposure).	2016-09-27 00:48:14Z	Lucky

9356	For the future, any time you're not sure whether to go to the ER in Canada, some (or maybe all?) provinces have a phone number where you can speak with a qualified nurse and ask. In BC it seems that the phone number is 811 (see healthlinkbc.ca )	2016-09-26 02:22:45Z	Eugene O
9356	@EugeneO, thank you so much! I just moved here from the USA and I have no idea how the medical system really works! Thanks so much! This is certainly helpful. In the USA, the cost of going to the ER is almost as terrifying as whatever you're dealing with and I don't think they even have a helpful phone number to help you determine how serious it is! THANKS! As an American, I was worried going to the urgent care clinic would take hours, but I walked right on in. I didn't even sit in a chair to wait. I am very pleased with Canada's healthcare!	2016-09-26 22:28:28Z

9353	Hi! Could you link to the many articles that relate to male ejaculation and its impact on life span?

9338	Welcome to SE! Great question, I'm very interested by the potential answers!	2016-09-23 08:39:36Z	JJosaur
9338	Why do you think this would damage vision?	2016-09-24 03:33:27Z	Carey Gregory
9338	My guess is that focusing on at a short distance would have the eyes muscles / ligaments in an extreme position which over time could reduce the ability to move to other positions easily hence slowing focus or leaving things blurry.	2016-09-25 22:58:04Z	
9330	Do some research and reword your questions in the form "I have heard X, Y and/or Z can help falling asleep,[insert link to evidence here] is this true?"	2016-09-21 10:23:19Z	JJosaur
9330	@daskas What have you tried so far? Some melatonin or something similar? It sounds like a mental health issue. You may also ask at  Personal Productivity site. I would suggest, take the notes of your ideas before going to sleep and try again.	2016-09-23 09:16:30Z	kenorb
9326	Stack exchange is a question and "correct answer" format. It is not a place to fish for peoples experiences and opinions. If you want to gain weight then eat more.	2016-09-21 10:43:34Z	JJosaur
9326	This is an interesting question frequently asked. If someone (including the OP) thinks it's not a proper question format, please edit it into a general question, like "Is it possible to gain weight?" or "How to gain weight?" or "Is your body weight determined by a biotype?" or so. There are a lot of misconceptions about this, so it can be a good discussion here.	2016-09-21 12:49:26Z	Jan

9315	I really like user197008's answer below! @hgiesel, would you consider looking into back rests for chairs? Do you have any background that emphasizes back muscle (yoga, dance, sports)? You may easily work on your posture there, and it may or may not leak into your other daily habits. If you do find that you're slouching while sitting up, and don't have the discipline to sit up straight, at least do some stretches to reduce strain.	2016-09-23 05:18:40Z	Mango Princess
9309	Hi! May I ask what your doctor told you when he prescribed you vitamin b12? And as a side note, could you edit your question, there are some words missing and some rephrasing needed. Thanks	2016-09-20 18:48:22Z	Felipe
9309	He told me I must sleep for eight to ten hours.	2016-09-20 18:57:35Z

9317	Unless you felt like death at the end of your last trip, whatever weight you lost is just fine and not concerning.	2016-09-20 06:01:21Z

9317	@Tullochgorum  Would the amount of weight change if it was in the city exercising in a gym?   They type of medical kit I take into the outdoors is different than the one in my home.  Bit by a snake in my backyard is different - go to hospital.   There is a health.se	2016-09-20 09:54:14Z	
9305	Nobody can give you a yes/no answer but the most likely answer is no, don't worry about it. You won't get the cold again for sure, but you could get the other infection she probably has now so be careful about washing your hands.	2016-09-21 02:44:48Z	Carey Gregory

9292	Humans lived just fine for millions of years without milk after infancy, and some people (eg, me) and entire cultures don't drink milk. So no, it's not necessary and never has been.	2016-09-20 14:13:07Z	Carey Gregory

9292	I'm not even sure what evidence you'd like me to reference. The hypothesis that humans need milk past infancy is what needs support here, not the self-evident conclusion that they don't.	2016-09-21 15:15:58Z	Carey Gregory
9286	There is nothing unhealthy about distilled or reverse-osmosis water. They lack the minerals often found dissolved in regular water, but those can be obtained elsewhere. So obviously you're not actually looking for pure water but rather water that meets some unspecified standard you have in mind. You need to specify what that standard is to make your question answerable.	2016-09-18 14:55:36Z	Carey Gregory

9264	I don't have a great answer but it may have to do with the bacteria, just as in armpit odor. Have you tried foot powders? I recently starting using one with tea tree oil and it has helped a lot	2016-09-16 15:17:39Z	Mango Princess
9264	Also not an answer, just suggestions from experience. I am on my feet all day and sweat, and had this issue for a little while.  I wash feet EVERY morning very well with (1) soap instead of my gentle body wash I was using, and (2) vigorous friction (rough washcloth or foot brush) EVEN IF I shower the night before. I use shoe powder, go barefoot when I'm at home (no sweating in socks), and if I have to leave without washing I have 2 pairs of shoes dedicated for "unclean" days.  I threw out many shoes (especially sandals with porous soles) and washed others.  Seems excessive, but worked.	2016-10-03 07:28:37Z	DoctorWhom
9264	Consider also (part of what is described below) that our skin produces oils, including soles/palms.  Look at your phone screen for example. You deposit these oils on surfaces including sandals and shoes.  Oils can contain odor, as well as bacteria and fungi. Washing (your skin or the surfaces)  decreases oils as well.	2016-10-03 07:45:54Z	DoctorWhom
9264	I’ve just heard someone say that their doctor recommended spraying alcohol on their feet or in their shoes and she said it worked wonderfully. For the first time in her life her feet don’t pong.

9252	Briefly for clarification: the answer will different from person to person, as gas/bloating can depend significantly on an individual's intestinal microbiome, food intolerances, medical conditions, etc. For example, her advice to eat beans may CAUSE bloating/gas in some people.  You might clarify that you seek principles on foods associated with gas/bloating in general, and whether long plane rides have any different considerations. Ensure you're not asking specific advice, and use information wisely; a medical provider can personalize it based on your conditions/medications etc.	2016-09-15 19:31:43Z	DoctorWhom
9252	Also, if you are specifically looking for Ayurvedic information as discussed in the article, I would mention that in your question.  Different health-related fields have similarities and differences in their principles and approaches to health.	2016-09-15 19:36:15Z	DoctorWhom
9252	Ok Thanks @Doctor Whom. Actually I am looking for more general information not necessarily Ayurvedic information. I know these websites are sometimes limited, hence my question on this forum. BR	2016-09-16 20:31:14Z	
9250	ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27540208 this small study compares the differences between effervescent tablets and liquid suspension but I suspect this question is too broad as the structure of supplements varies massively.	2016-09-15 13:27:28Z	JJosaur
9250	As above, and also a clarification: is the question asking about the effervescence property itself, or about liquid suspension vs tablet?	2016-09-15 20:13:32Z	DoctorWhom
9250	I am asking, which choice should I make to get most of It's properties? tablet or effervescent tablet?	2016-09-15 20:52:46Z	
9312	In the original article, below the table, there should be an explanation for Calorie Level or Pattern (a) and Food Group (b) (as you see in the upper left corner of the table). I explained it below.	2017-01-18 19:54:13Z	Jan

9237	Hi! May I ask you whether you have already seen a gastroenterologist? I don't want to sound rude but all of your questions here on Health SE have a strong "asking for personal medical advice" connotation. As you seem to be very much focused on your IBS symptoms, I think you should definitely see a specialist. And finally, could you also provide some links to your research? Just asking "I want to know" doesn't help in improving the quality of your question. Cheers! Felipe	2016-09-14 13:46:22Z	Felipe
9237	@VikasKumar. To be honest, I think you haven't understood the purpose of this website. As indicated in the yellow box of every "Health SE Health Stack Exchange is for educational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for individualized diagnosis and treatment by a qualified healthcare provider" So obviously you have crossed this line many times with all your very "asking for personal medical advices" questions. Every time someone tries to give you a "general advice" you push the person to provide you specialised advice.	2016-09-15 13:23:19Z	Felipe
9237	Again, this website is not here to replace your gastroenterologist or any other health professional. And to be honest, you current behavior of asking many different questions won't help you in understanding what's happening to you. You need a health professional who will go through each single point with you by taking into account your particular case and this can't be done on this website. If your current gastroenterologist doesn't suit you, then find another.	2016-09-15 13:28:55Z	Felipe
9237	Finally, what makes me sad, is that although many users on this website have tried to make you understand that asking for personal advice is off topic here (either by downvoting or VTC), you don't seem to take this into account. And your final comment asking @DoctorWhom if you could chat with him to ask him questions is again pathognomonic for your current behavior on this SE. People want to help you by giving you "general advices" and you push then to give you personalised advices. Needless to say that I keep my downvote(s). Cheers, Felipe	2016-09-15 13:35:04Z	Felipe
9237	Felipe, I totally understand all your points. Though, I am not sure this is the place to raise those issues. Maybe you could ask a Health Meta question to help getting the opinion from other high rep users (+moderators). Anyway, I really hope @Doctor Whom will be cautious with the invitation for this chat, which indeed, looks like an invitation for a "personalised medical advice" chat...

9232	I tried to search it on the net but couldn't find much Really? The search terms "vegetarian" and "vitamin b" on google retrieve more than 3 millions entries. "Shopping question" should really be avoided on Health SE. At least you could provide some links to the research you have already done and explain what is not clear for you. BW	2016-09-14 21:14:59Z	S.Victor
9232	@S.Victor They're all contradictory. For instance, I've learnt here that there is vegetarian source for active B12. Google search gives you tens of them. The percentage content is different on every site, sometimes too different. So, I had discredit that research, look for a reliable source. And ofcourse, I can't surf through 3 million search results now, can I?	2016-09-15 02:38:48Z	
9232	Actually, this wasn't my point to say you should surf through 3 millions entries. I just wanted to underline the inconsistency of your statement "I'm asking this here because I tried to search it on the net but couldn't find much". As I said, you should at least provide some examples of the links you have found, their contents and what seems "contradictory" to you. Finally, the first hits for the google search retrieves informations from websites such as WebMD and NHS Info for example, which are reliable sources. BW	2016-09-15 13:53:00Z	S.Victor
9232	@S.Victor alright, I didn't about these sites. Only now I have learnt about their reliability. My bad.	2016-09-16 04:45:16Z	
9224	Hi! Can you give some links to the reviews suggesting that yogurt, garlic, basil leaves, cranberries, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda are effective against yeast infection (as you seem to suggest in your question I've heard mixed reviews)? This would probably help in providing an accurate answer. And as a side note: have you considered seeing your GP (or gynaecologist if it is the vagina)? Why only home remedies and not drugs? Best wishes	2016-09-14 07:31:42Z	S.Victor
9224	@S.Victor, I don't know that hydrogen peroxide & baking soda are effective at all. Hence, my question. I've heard, literally heard, about it from several friends so unfortunately I do not have a source. As for your drug vs. home treatment comment, who said I wasn't using drugs? And the question was not "what is the best treatment" anyway - there could be a many reasons why supplemental home remedies would be sought out: maybe I don't have insurance, I'm traveling abroad, the pharmacy is closed, etc, but that's besides the point. I just want to know if hydrogen peroxide & baking soda work	2016-09-14 18:38:47Z	
9224	@S.Victor, if you just google yogurt and yeast infections -- you'll get a million listings. Yogurt is a common knowledge remedy when it comes to yeast infections. I hadn't heard of the garlic and basil and cranberry bits, but sure enough, they are listed as common remedies as well: everydayhealth.com/yeast-infection/guide/treatments/…	2016-09-14 18:49:02Z	Butterfly and Bones
9224	Actually my point was that it would be nice to provide some links in your question which suggest possible effects of these substances on candidasis. As I said, this helps providing an accurate answer (in order to understand the website's arguments). Finally, I was asking about drugs because this is currently the most evidence based approach in the treatment of candidasis. That said, I have provided an answer below for vulvovaginal candidasis (as I understood you asked this question for this indication in particular). Hope this brought some clarifications. BW	2016-09-14 20:30:54Z	S.Victor
9222	Be careful in how you use the answers people give to these sorts of questions.  None of us knows your specific asthma history.  For example, if you've been hospitalized repeatedly vs never hospitalized with rare symptoms.  Even then it could end up being the first time for status asthmaticus.  Just a reminder	2016-09-14 05:34:14Z	DoctorWhom
9222	At first I thought you were a real doctor, perhaps of Asian origin. I actually had status asthmaticus, but I had asthma out of control for several weeks and ended up overdosing on my inhaler (I was a kid). This is why now I'm reluctant to even use the inhaler on minor attacks. This is why I got interested in what the correct approach is.	2016-09-14 09:15:47Z	
9222	I am a real doctor (MD in residency) but I NEVER give personalized medical advice over the internet because there are SO MANY key factors involved with medical diagnoses/treatments considerations that it would be at least poor practice to do so, and potentially harmful. I do however believe that everyone deserves to understand health and am dedicated to sharing the knowledge I've spent ages learning in order to help increase understanding of health issues, whether in my clinic rooms or otherwise.  So again, I happily give general information for understanding, but it is not personalized.	2016-09-14 18:33:18Z	DoctorWhom

9209	It seems to me that if the oxygen partial pressure is a lot lower and you want to maintain the same oxygen concentration in your blood then that requires more work for your body which may not be the optimal thing to do. If the ambient conditions are too far away from the usual norm, then you're probably going to be better off by allowing some changes.	2016-09-12 20:45:03Z	Count Iblis
9208	I don't know your specific case, so I can't give you specific advice.  A physical therapist or orthopedist may be better equipped to give a more thorough answer.  But I can give some info.  I changed my post to a comment as I do not have links to specific sources at this moment, but want to discuss the principles of biomechanics that I learned from lectures and conversations with physical therapists, anatomy lectures, orthopedic surgeons.  The issue with lying with one's hips in external rotation for 8 hours a day is along the lines of what they said:	2016-09-15 00:51:53Z	DoctorWhom
9208	(1.) in extended external rotation position, the external rotators are shortened and over time/repeated can become tighter (2.) the internal rotators are stretched and can become more lax (3.) this can cause imbalance in hip/knee motion and gait (4.) ANY poorly aligned joint or gait abnormalities can cascade outwards to affect other joints and muscles (it's all connected!)	2016-09-15 00:53:00Z	DoctorWhom
9208	Experience: I personally have done physical therapy for tightened external/lax internal rotators that caused lower back pain from (among other issues) sitting cross-legged (external rotation) all the time.  And asked 1,000s of questions of my PT for learning purposes.  This is how I address it with patients as well.	2016-09-15 00:57:16Z	DoctorWhom
9208	Lastly, I have asked "what is the proper sleep position" of physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons.  They all said whatever feels comfortable and neutral and doesn't cause pain/problems.  But this isn't necessarily for everyone, depending on situation. Some people may need to change their sleep position to improve symptoms.  Many back sleepers put a pillow beneath their knees to support the curve, keep more neutral, and relieve pressure in the lumbar back region.  Again, not personalized advice.	2016-09-15 00:58:39Z	DoctorWhom
9208	@doctorwhom - please put this as an answer. Answering in comments sidesteps the voting process and is not allowed on SE sites.	2017-05-27 12:10:36Z	JohnP
9207	Welcome to health SE :-). I don't have any resources at the moment, but this information should be provided by the physician. If that is not enough, there might be some patient support groups in your area that might help. (You may have already thought of this, but just in case you haven't).	2016-09-12 16:04:38Z	Lucky
9207	Giving specific advice is dangerous without a visit, especially for DM1. I recommend that he/she make an appointment with a primary care provider. What will help the provider determine management most would be: Bring any past medical records about her management of diabetes, or have them sent to the doctor's office.  Until day of appointment, take daily pre-breakfast AM blood sugar readings, and on a couple of days take a reading before dinner and then 1 hr after dinner. Kep track of all insulin/medication use, and diet as best as she can.  Also, make a list of questions to ask.	2016-09-15 05:46:49Z	DoctorWhom
9207	The provider can connect you/them with programs for teaching patients about diabetes and supporting good management; they differ by region. Nutritionists are awesome to work with to really work through eating options. If her management is really difficult, she may be sent to an endocrinologist	2016-09-15 05:47:09Z	DoctorWhom
9201	For clarification, I think it would help to add which benefits you are specifically looking for. In the links provided, there are numerous things listed with minimal references to evidence. For example, there are similarities and differences in the principles of light/phototherapy for dermatological conditions, for circadian regulation, for seasonal affective disorder, for Vitamin D3, etc - including safety and efficacy of natural light vs controlled light application.  Benjamin A touched on some of these below, but if you are looking for more information, clarification will help.	2016-09-15 19:02:32Z	DoctorWhom
9199	A great question! Welcome to health SE :-)	2016-09-12 13:58:21Z	Lucky

9195	Can you provide a link to this device? It's not readily found with a web search and we have to know what you're talking about.	2016-09-13 03:52:52Z	Carey Gregory
9195	@CareyGregory No problem - link added. I questioned whether to add a link before, but didn't want to seem like I was pitching a sale...	2016-09-13 09:37:05Z	
9193	I'm sorry to hear that you've had such a rough time of things so young!  This is not my area of expertise, but either way, answering if something is right for you can only really be done in person by a specialist.  When was the last time you saw your/an orthopedic surgeon about the status of (and options for) your ankles/feet?	2016-09-15 05:32:56Z	DoctorWhom
9174	Hi! I am not sure you will find something about "insulin resistance explained to kids" as even this concept is not even known to many adults. I was wondering: as you seem to have some good knowledge on it, why don't you just make one yourself? Maybe it would be easier. Here an example of how diabetes is explained to kids by the diabetes research institute foundation: diabetesresearch.org/document.doc?id=274. You could do something similar for insulin resistance. It's just a suggestion. Anyway, good luck, best regards, M. Arrowsmith	2016-09-10 08:27:37Z	M. Arrowsmith
9174	How old is your son and why exactly do you want to make him read such an article?	2016-09-10 13:50:16Z	Jan
9174	@Jan - He is 13.  See next comment.	2016-09-11 02:36:22Z	
9174	@aparente001. Indeed, I misunderstood your purpose. Your description of what the article should achieve and the elements it should not start with (It shouldn't start with an explanation of beta cells) made me believe the article was meant for the children of your son's school. Tbh I am still not sure what exactly you were looking for, particularly when I look your answer below. But you have found something, which seems to suit you, and this is the most important thing! Good luck, Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-09-11 08:38:19Z	M. Arrowsmith
9174	@M.Arrowsmith - I wanted something not too technical that the school personnel would understand.  They keep confusing hypoglycemia and insulin resistance.  (They don't see the former occurring and therefore assume he doesn't have IR.)  They also confuse pre-diabetes and IR.  (He doesn't have the former, or the lab values that would go with the former, and therefore they assume he doesn't have IR.)	2016-09-12 04:19:04Z	
9169	If the water doesn't go into you, where does it go?	2016-09-10 04:20:45Z	Carey Gregory
9169	It goes nowhere. It does not flow at all. It is as if the end of the tube is against an obstacle.	2016-09-10 15:49:48Z	
9169	Have you tried letting the water flow a bit first? A big air bubble can make it harder.	2016-09-12 08:09:26Z	JJosaur
9167	There are many factors... for example, potassium counteracts sodium.. that's just one factor.	2016-09-09 18:49:58Z	Othya
9167	Humans evolved in a sodium-poor, potassium-rich environment, therefore our bodies are very good at retaining sodium and excreting potassium. It would be virtually impossible to not get adequate salt intake even if you never added a grain of salt to anything ever again. After all, our ancestors didn't.	2016-09-10 15:42:35Z	Carey Gregory
9160	Keep in mind that lawsuits are the most biased, unrealiable source of science information you can possibly find. Lawyers are paid to be biased. They are paid to highlight facts that support their case and conceal facts that contradict it. Also keep in mind that suing drug companies is a very big business. There are entire law firms that do nothing else. I would not consider lawsuits against a manufacturer of any drug to be evidence of that drug's value or lack thereof.	2016-09-09 01:32:11Z	Carey Gregory
9160	@CareyGregory I agree with everything you wrote except the last sentence. Remember that drug companies are often profit-driven multi-billion dollar corporations. Lawyers are extremely biased and often conceal information. Tragically, the same can be said for many drug manufacturers. I have a friend currently trying a new experimental drug  (not related to Mirena), and the bias of the company hired to administer the drug trials is obvious & disconcerting. When my friend reports side effects, they just tell her it can't be from the experimental drug because others don't have the same issue.	2016-09-09 09:55:35Z	RockPaperLizard
9160	@RockPaperLizard I don't now how that reflects on my opinion that the mere existence of lawsuits says nothing about a drug's value.	2016-09-09 13:17:43Z	Carey Gregory
9159	The amount of time devoted to clinical studies before releasing a new drug depends on many factors, being the most important the regulatory requisites in your country. However, once it's released the drug is still monitored for years, even their whole commercial life and beyond. So "long term" is a hazy term when talking about drugs. Also, you can't expect he same kind of long-term effects from medicines for chronical conditions than from the ones you'd take sporadically.	2016-09-09 08:15:14Z	Variax
9158	Good question, +1. But doesn't it belong to biology.SE?	2016-09-08 20:47:43Z	ABcDexter
9158	Maybe it does... I guess my reasons for asking are actual health related reasons. But, since I didn't specify that - maybe it's more biology. Should I move it myself or wait till it is flagged? lol	2016-09-08 21:41:17Z

9146	I'd like to see you spread your fruit out a bit better through the day, and have some protein with your fruit during your break time.  Also, raw vegetables make a helpful snack, such as carrots -- partly because of the roughage, partly because of all the chewing action.  Note that you have one or more typos in your boldface question.  I'm not sure exactly how to edit it.	2016-09-10 04:20:28Z	aparente001
9146	Thanks @aparente001 for pointing the typos out. Actually, I edited the question some days ago but obviously omitted the bold part. Is this ok now? Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-09-10 07:57:27Z	M. Arrowsmith

9144	Hi @user51778. I have edited your question by deleting some "personal parts" which might be seen as off topic on health SE (and lead to closing of your question). I have provided an answer below, and stayed quite general. If you need a more accurate response (taking into account your personal medical history) I would suggest seeing your gynaecologist. Hope you understand. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith (and actually, the tags you were suggesting were already available so I added them to your question)	2016-09-07 22:52:59Z	M. Arrowsmith
9142	Hi! I am not sure I understand your question right. Why would you want to do a blood test after the gout attack? Gout is a clinical diagnosis (+/- articular punction tests). The treatment will depend on your clinical suspicion. There are patients with gout arthritis having normal acid uric levels ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581951. Sorry if I am missing something in your question. BW	2016-09-07 20:09:54Z	S.Victor
9142	Hi, and thanks for your comment. The case I am talking about, is when a gout attack occurs, and then the doctor wants to check if the cause of the gout is high uric acid levels. This isn't the only cause of gout, but certainly one of the major ones, so usually a blood test is taken after an attack to determine whether it was due to high uric acid levels. My question is then about how long you should leave it after the attack, before doing the blood test. Given that a gout attack removes some uric acid, do you need to wait a few weeks before your uric acid levels return to your typical level?	2016-09-08 10:18:54Z	
9142	Ok @Karnivaurus, thanks for clarifying this. I think I have understood your question. Hope my answer below brings some clarifications. BW	2016-09-08 10:48:11Z	S.Victor
9138	Hi @iDeveloper. Interesting question. I have just made some small "cosmetic" edits. Hope you agree. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-09-07 15:11:03Z	M. Arrowsmith

9124	What exactly do you mean by recovery? Less tiredness or muscle soreness after physical exercise?	2016-09-06 15:37:54Z	Jan

9122	Medically healthy by whose standard?	2016-09-06 08:49:31Z	JJosaur
9122	@JJosaur By the average person?	2016-09-06 15:32:09Z	
9122	What does "Medically healthy" mean? I have never heard it before... Can you be healthy but not medically?	2016-09-06 16:56:54Z	S.Victor
9122	@S.Victor Basically my question is: "Is it important to do strength exercises in order to maintain normal health?"	2016-09-06 17:00:19Z	
9122	Ok thanks for clarifying @Jessica. Though "normal health" is a very broad concept considering the WHO definition of health: "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". Doing exercise won't prevent you from having some diseases and hence become "unhealthy". But I see that someone answered your question, so I am probably to fussy. Hope you will find what you are looking for. BW	2016-09-06 17:19:15Z	S.Victor

9117	Literature about the harms of blue light (specially from LED sources) is far from conclusive at the moment. Further studies might clear it up, but so far it looks like it's not going to be solid science. Check this related link for more information: health.stackexchange.com/a/1431/5383  When presented with conflicting information from different sources, often the one to trust will be the one that isn't trying to sell you something :)	2016-09-05 15:24:37Z	Variax
9117	Not only LED monitors, but also LED lights emit strongly on 455 nm (blue peak). Some computer manufacturers started placing filters to reduce that strong peak, and buying LED lights with warm white color also helps to reduce the peak. This is not an answer since I don't know if the fear is justified.	2016-09-08 09:46:08Z	FarO
9105	It is against SE policy to give just mere opinions, so I've edited your question to make it a bit more on-topic (you can always roll-back to the previous version if you disagree). To get a more precise answer it would be useful if you described how you intend to use guarana and what type and amount of coffee are we comparing it to. Thanks!	2016-09-06 11:51:36Z	Lucky
9104	What type of professional do you want to answer this question? A doctor or scientist that specializes in marijuana and it's side effects long term, or perhaps you would consider an elderly man that has smoked for many years to discuss on the topic from his perspective.

9096	In order to generate an immunity to a virus, there has to be enough of an infection to generate an immune response. By this I mean that the infection has to get past our body's first line of defense, the white blood cells, and cause the immune system to send out t-helper cells to get antigen markers on the virus' protein shell, which in turn the body uses to make specific antibodies for the virus in question. I don't know that this is quantifiable, which is why I offer this as a comment rather than an answer.	2016-09-03 16:52:26Z	BillDOe

9091	Hi! If your in-grown nail hurts, it could mean that it is infected or has an abscess (=paronychia). In that case, I would suggest to see your GP, who will perhaps have to do a drainage. Note that in some cases of acute paronychia, no "surgical intervention" is needed,  and warm water soaks 3-4 times per day +/- antibiotics might be enough (this depends on your risk factors, eg diabetes etc). But again, I would suggest you see a specialist. Good luck. Best regards. M.

9085	Fair point, I updated the question.	2016-09-03 11:58:17Z	
9085	This sounds like something said in an action movie, a thriller, or maybe film noir.  Are you sure that what you read wasn't a misquote from some source like that?

9071	@JagmeetSingh. I am not sure what you understand by I didn't ask a question? Before my edit of your question, you asked Why do I forget easily, isn't this a question? Also, I am confused by your statement "I guess what I really wanted to know was that is this a medical condition " but you then add "Not seeking a medical advice". Tbh, I don't really see the difference. And finally, if you find the time to read my answer carefully as well as the links provided, you would realise that there are a lot of factors possibly affecting memory and you are certainly not an isolated case. BR	2016-09-11 08:49:49Z	M. Arrowsmith
9071	@JagmeetSingh. if someone told me to do something in 20 minutes, it would slip out of my mind, There is no memorization involved I believe. If this has nothing to do with memorization, could you explain me what it is and the neurobiological pathways involved then? From my knowledge/experience, this is linked to memorization. Similar with your sentence I would get distracted with some thoughts and just forget to take it. Tbh I think you should have a look at a Neuroscience book (e.g Kandel Principles of Neuroscience) and have some lecture on the pathways involved in memorization. BR	2016-09-11 08:59:21Z	M. Arrowsmith
9069	Because your body is not getting the nutrients it needs. And the body's way of getting you to consume nutrients is by telling you it's hungry? In this case you are technically getting all the calories you might need but the body is still lacking (?)	2016-09-02 04:21:16Z	larry909

9069	There are way too many variables involved to give you a meaningful answer to that. What's adequate for your body one week may not be the same as the next, never mind all the other thousand variables such as gender, age, fertility status, activity levels, time of year, genes, exercise, health... the list is endless.	2016-09-05 04:06:38Z	Carey Gregory
9069	Everyone is always a little unique but there are general guidelines which most people's target amount is near. @james to answer your comment question directly; feeling full has most to do with getting the correct amount of protien, fats, and carbohydrates. Usually in that order. Vitamins are very important but don't really make you feel full.	2017-04-06 09:31:48Z	larry909

9055	@larry909 But over time, the reproduction of cells are more prone to random mutations, and more of a production would lead to a higher chance of mutation, no?	2016-09-02 16:49:42Z	
9055	The proof is in the pudding. Personally I see people who are built bigger and stronger and they tend to age just as well or not well as lighter people. And I would think it mostly has to do with maintaining a healthy lifestyle and good inherited genes.	2016-09-02 19:21:02Z	larry909
9053	When you say "better care" do you mean " are they nicer?" I would guess not necessarily.

9006	Interesting question. Though I am not sure to which substance you are referring. Two years ago, there was a very interesting article in Nature Neuroscience called "The missense of smell: functional variability in the human odorant receptor repertoire" by Mainland et al. Without wanting to go into too much details, they showed that there is a huge genetic variation in olfactory perception (they gave the example of more than 30% difference in odorant receptor alleles between 2 persons) between individuals. So probably, there are >1 substance that some individuals can smell and other not. BR	2016-08-26 14:02:45Z	M. Arrowsmith
9006	Here the link to the article: nature.com/neuro/journal/v17/n1/full/nn.3598.html. Unfortunately it is not open access. I could convert this comment to an answer and give some extracts of the article but maybe someone more updated than me will bring some acurate answer (with a precise name of the substance you are referring to) to your question. Good luck. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith.	2016-08-26 14:04:58Z	M. Arrowsmith

8966	Like using UV to kill the bacteria? There are a lot of dentists and researchers in the world, I'm sure if they found a way for you to brush your teeth more efficiently then they would have found it, packaged it, marketed it and sold it for $49.99	2016-08-24 08:52:12Z	JJosaur
8966	Dentists commonly use ultrasound (ultrasonic scalers) to clean teeth. While they may still be sticking a tool into your mouth and presumably scraping off plaque, ultrasound vibrations actually aid in removing plaque and biofilms from your teeth. Probably not what you're imagining though. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_cleaning	2016-08-24 15:38:37Z	TheChinBurglar
8959	To be honest, I don't really understand your question which is actually based on wrong assumptions. Nobody can tell you with such a precision that you will have a heart attack in one month. If this were possible, that would avoid many morbidity and mortality associated with heart attacks in high risk patients as this could be avoided by hospitalising those patients during one month and "wait" for the heart attack to come... Do you want to know what a person at high risk for cardiovascular disease can do to prevent a heart attack? That would make more sense in my opinion. Best wishes.	2016-08-23 17:33:09Z	S.Victor
8959	@S.Victor  I apologize - Yes, this is a "crystal ball" type of scenario.  If you prefer, your interpretation is perfectly valid: a patient at high risk for cardiovascular disease sits down in your office, and after doing an observation your gut feeling is this individual has a good chance to have a heart attack in a month.  What do you tell them?	2016-08-23 17:37:23Z	
8959	Well, not sure if those "crystall ball" type of scenario make really sense, particularly considering that medicine is based on facts... And what do you mean by "doing an observation"? And what is an "unhealthy individual" for you? Depending on the gender/enthnicity/country you could calculate his cardiovascular risk score: health.stackexchange.com/questions/8685/…. Depending on the risk factors, you could refer to the adequate guidelines, to guide you through the management of these risk factors. Best wishes.	2016-08-23 17:44:42Z	S.Victor
8959	@S.Victor Thank you for the link, that will likely lead me in the direction I wanted to go.  Cheers!	2016-08-23 17:49:23Z	
8959	I have seen that you edited your question but in my opinion, the question has still some inconsistencies. You say "unhealthy" and you say "obese" and "pre-hypertension" so obviously the individual doesn't even meet the criteria for a metabolic syndrome (according to the info you are providing in your question) so he might be a so called "metabolically healthy obese". In some studies, those individuals have similar risk for CVD as normal individuals (for a good review: bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/…). But maybe I am too fussy... Best wishes	2016-08-23 17:55:36Z	S.Victor
8969	I had a brief look at the study posted below. There is no answer to your question, but at least an interesting point: women who had breast reduction surgery 'did not participate in physical activities because of the size of the their breasts. One study found that breast reduction patients avoided exercise because of feeling self-conscious of their breast sizes, and they were less likely to engage in self-care behaviors [...] Collins et al. found that breast reduction patients had difficulty participating in sports the majority of the time because of the size of their breasts. ' (continue)	2016-08-23 20:46:18Z	AlexDeLarge
8969	That indicates that - even if it might be possible - affected women could tend not to want to exercise in order to make the surgery unnecessary. According to that, the psychological component might be stronger than the physical one and therefore adapting to live with large breasts might not even be an option for at least some patients.	2016-08-23 20:50:23Z	AlexDeLarge

8934	Stimulants such as caffeine, alcohol, hot food, cigarettes, etc. are all bad for people with IBS. No, it's not just a rumor. It stimulates your intestine in a bad way. As to an alternative to Coke, some traditional Chinese medicine might work. As you probably already know, most drinks for boosting your energy has caffeine in them which you might wanna stay away from.	2016-08-22 05:42:44Z	Mikiko

8890	Hi! Interesting. When you mean by "professionals", you mean an "ophtalmologist"? Dry eyes is a very common symptom. However, in some cases they may be associated with an underlying condition. If obviously, none of the eyes drops are helping, I think, it would be worth seeing an eye specialist (=ophtalmologist). Best regards. M. Arrowsmith.	2016-08-18 18:21:58Z	M. Arrowsmith

8881	Evidence of what? Evidence that people tend to gain weight after quitting smoking? As for treatment, I don't think it's a condition that needs treating. People who quit smoking simply need to recognize that they're giving up a stimulant that caused them to burn more calories than they normally would, so they need to reduce calorie consumption, increase exercise, or both.	2016-08-17 19:44:11Z	Carey Gregory
8881	Hi! I have just answered your question. Small comment: I would maybe think of editing your question. I think that it would be better to replace "obesity after quitting smoking" with "weight gain after quitting smoking" as not every weight gain leads necessary to obesity. What do you think? Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-17 21:03:40Z	M. Arrowsmith

8875	Hi! Just to be sure that I understood your question correctly: you want to know if a person with a coronary heart disease, under ASA, betablocker, furosemide, statin has an increased risk for developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia? I am right? May I ask you why you are asking for this typical hematological malignancy? You may also wish considering editing your title which is somehow inconsistent with your question (too broad for a very specific question). Thank you. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-17 16:37:47Z	M. Arrowsmith
8875	Hi, I am asking this question because I know of someone who has a heart condition and been taking these medicines for some years now. The person has now been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. As mentioned in my earlier post this person has no family history of cancer nor any lifestyle issue that puts the person in the risk category for cancer.	2016-08-21 01:28:45Z	
8875	Ok. I have answered your question. I will also edit a little bit your question. As already suggested in my first comment, the title is inconsistent with your question and can be misleading as you are asking about CLL in particular and not cancer. And as a side note: when asking a question on Health SE, it is better to write the compound name of a drug and not its market name, which can be different from one country to another. Hope this helps. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-22 07:14:51Z	M. Arrowsmith
8867	When you ask "how to deal with low blood pressure", do you mean a particular symptom associated with low BP? If so, please describe. If not, there's not much to "deal with", but perhaps you want to ask if there are any risks of having too low BP?	2016-08-17 08:11:24Z	Susan
8866	Interesting question. Also very trendy concern. Though, could you define what you understand by "brain health (mentally and physically)"? The concept of physically brain health is new (and vague) to me. Thank you. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-17 08:49:35Z	M. Arrowsmith

8860	Immunisation treatment of allergies introduces allergen components into the patient and presumably these are much smaller than the whole pollen grain.	2017-05-25 12:42:33Z	
8860	However, HEPA filters can actually be very effective at trapping particles smaller than 0.3 microns. The 0.3 microns size is actually a weak point for HEPA filtration which is why it is tested for the classification of the filter (source link).  What happens to these particles as they decompose and whether components are eventually ejected is still a mystery to me.	2017-05-25 12:51:10Z	
8860	I saw a HEPA air purifier that included a layer to neutralise allergens. I am not sure whether it utilised polyphenols (as in some car cabin air filters) or by some other process. This suggests the manufacturer believed it to be beneficial to neutralise allergens despite HEPA filtration. Unfortunately I cannot find it any more. I do remember it was made by a large global manufacturer, which makes it even more frustrating :-)	2017-05-25 12:56:30Z	
8856	Interesting question. Though, I think it would be worse explaining what TENS and FES mean. These are not common abbreviations and explaining what they mean would probably help in making your question clearer. Thank you. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith.	2016-08-17 08:57:11Z	M. Arrowsmith

But I hope someone will find something to provide you an accurate answer. Good luck. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-19 18:23:15Z	M. Arrowsmith

8843	Hi! Interesting paper. Though, I am not sure whether I understood your question correctly, as at the end of this same paper there is a paragraph "8. Proof-of-Concept of a Vaccine Using UV Inactivated Adv36" where the authors review current evidence for a vaccine against Adv36? Do you want to know whether since this article has been published (i.e Jul 2015), there are new evidences for a vaccine against Adv36? I am right in my understanding? Thank you. Best regards. M. Arrowsmith	2016-08-15 09:37:24Z	M. Arrowsmith
8843	@M.Arrowsmith : In general when asking "Do we have a drug that does X" I mean to ask do we have an FDA approved drug (or one approved in Europe). One that went through the stages of clinical tests.	2016-08-15 10:18:03Z	
8843	I completely agree with M.Arrowsmith comments. I think there are several issues with your question: first you probably cite the wrong parts of the paper. Section 5 should be the parts you should highlight in your question as this provides results from in vivo studies in humans (case controls studies, meta-anaylsis) and therefore supports your current suggestion that the virus might be a publich health issue. You should probably also add some extracts about results of experimental studies regarding vaccines against Adv36. And then conclude with you question about FDA approved drug.	2016-08-15 10:37:37Z	S.Victor
8843	Finally, considering that the review was done in 2015, it is hard to imagine that within 1 year, one of those experimental vaccines have gone through all the necessary steps (particularly phase III trials) to get the final clinical approval. These processes are tedious and take in general some years to reach final approval. But maybe I am wrong...	2016-08-15 10:41:20Z	S.Victor

8709	Vicryl comes in both dyed (purple) and undyed (white); the purple is easier to see (thus work with) so purple is most often used when it's not someplace obvious. If the doctor told you it was vicryl (and if you're really worried, read his report), then it will ultimately dissolve; the amount of moisture a place has (e.g. the mouth) will affect the suture's rate of dissolution.

8676	Go home and drink a cup of vegetable oil. Tomorrow let us know how that went.	2016-08-04 18:11:46Z	Carey Gregory
8676	@CareyGregory In the interest of science, I did. I made the mistake of adding vinegar for flavor, and it wasn't the most pleasant experience. I then tried smaller amounts at a time without the vinegar and I didn't feel any different than usual.	2016-08-05 00:27:20Z	
8676	You drank a full cup of vegetable oil and suffered no effects in the next 24 hours?	2016-08-05 03:52:23Z	Carey Gregory
8676	@CareyGregory I suffered some stomach ache, severe headache and some nausea for a few hours, and then I tried again after I felt better, but in smaller doses spread out over a few hours, and I was totally fine. This leads me to believe that the ill effects were caused either by basically flooding the digestive system with oil in one fell swoop, the aforementioned vinegar I added for flavor (apparently I don't love salad dressing enough to drink it by the cup), or both. When spread out over time without vinegar, at least sunflower oil is perfectly tolerable in my experience.	2016-08-05 06:14:55Z

7665	Parkinson's Disease has been happening to old people for thousands of years, long before pesticides even existed. A person living in a city or suburb is just as likely to get Parkinson's as a rural farmer.	2016-08-03 15:59:37Z	Tyler Durden
7665	@Tyler Any scientific evidence for those claims?	2016-08-04 11:24:22Z	Lucky
7665	I think it would be nice to have a "parkinson" tag. I don't have enough reputation so could someone with enough reputation (at least 150) create one? This would be very useful. Thank you very much in advance.	2016-08-04 12:32:07Z	
7665	@Tyler Durden. Ok might perhaps be true for older individuals. But in my case, my relative is not that old and probably has a so called Young Onset Parkinson Disease (so not a "typical" PD which occurs in the elderly). This is why, because of his negative family history, one of the doctor suggested environmental exposure (in our case pesticide) as possible explanation. But anyway, thank you for your suggestion.	2016-08-04 12:36:52Z	
7665	@Richard Callahan: good suggestion. I have created a "parkinson" tag. Hope this helps for future questions! Best wishes.	2016-08-09 20:29:54Z	S.Victor

7610	This is not the norm. Any type of sore that doesn't heal is abnormal and if they happen commonly then a doctor or dentist needs to get involved to find out what's causing them.	2016-07-31 16:34:55Z	Carey Gregory
7610	Hi @CareyGregory, thanks for your comment. You said that it's not the norm for a gum abscess not to heal on its own, so I guess some do heal on their own. What I'm wondering is why some heal on their own and others need to be drained before they can heal. Why do some remain for years without healing?	2016-08-01 18:24:16Z	
7610	Because there's an underlying problem that isn't being addressed. Gum abscesses are not normal in the first place, and abscesses that last for years are certainly not normal.	2016-08-01 18:49:00Z	Carey Gregory
7610	Ok, I understand. May I know what the underlying problem could be that can cause the abscess to not be normal and behave this way? Thank you.	2016-08-02 01:41:59Z

7491	It varies so much on personal requirements. The FDA diet is not the only way to consume macronutrients. Keto (low/0-carb) is a valid way to live your life healthily. Absorption of vitamins and minerals depends heavily on each other as well.	2016-07-21 15:11:07Z	JJosaur
7491	@JJosaur - I'm not interested in what is "valid."  To better explain, I am interested in what is cheap.  If you tell me that (all carbs + no meat) is just as valid as (all meat + no carbs) in that case all I need to know is which costs more, meat or carbs.  I can handle the shopping.  I just need you to tell me which of the above choices are better, worse, or equally valid and how to determine that.	2016-07-22 18:14:42Z	
7491	If money is the big driver then you can easily hit your macro and micro nutrients while eat frugally. That said, energy comes from calories (proteins, fats and carbs) so focus on those mainly. The micros should follow unless you are using food supplements.	2016-07-22 18:17:30Z	JJosaur

7425	yes, hypertension would be a good example, assuming there are studies spanning longer than 20 years (hypertension was also the possibility I was thinking of, so I'd be interested in hearing about other areas).	2016-07-17 02:35:02Z

7344	I'm afraid a question has been asked that can be answered with facts.  It has been dealt with in extended similar cucumstances previously, which makes it factual.  This cannot really be theoretical.  To say it can't be answered with facts, is your opinion.  You could have a family member in the same position sometime.	2016-07-09 02:19:27Z	
7344	As for opinions, I am a member of another Exchsnge area website, which was what drew me to here.  As they do not process the finalisation of my questions, opinions are provided.

7290	Sugar free and alorie free are two differen thinks, what are you talking about specifically?	2016-07-03 09:43:15Z	Christian
7290	The substance is most likely known as caffeine. Obviously with zero calories it provides zero nutritional value, and therefore zero energy, but a great big dose of caffeine will make the gullible of the world think they're drinking something more than a glorified cup of coffee and therefore they will hand over their hard-earned money to the people who dreamed that nonsense up.	2016-07-03 15:18:41Z	Carey Gregory
7290	@Christian - The first paragraph is just background. I'm specifically asking about energy drinks advertised as "Zero Calorie". I imagine an energy drink could be made with starch and still legitimately be advertised as "sugar free".	2016-07-07 13:41:35Z

7283	Has anything changed in your life recently? Is there something that has happened that might explain the sudden change in concentration? (If I may ask) For me personally, my lack of concentration comes from overthinking and pondering. The more I have going on (mostly negative), the more I think about that instead om my schoolwork.

7271	Welcome to health SE :-). It is best to stick to one question per post, so it would be easier to compose a proper answer with references. Would you like us to focus on effects of black tea (i.e. earl gray) or chamomile? For the quantity there may be some references, but this question would be answered best by your dietitian.	2016-08-23 07:46:05Z	Lucky
7271	I would like to know about black tea first	2016-08-23 10:30:31Z	
7271	Black tea has caffeine which will make you move more, but for best results try matcha green tea. Not just green tea, matcha. It's more sustained over a longer period of time. Of course if your goal is weight loss, it's better to skip the late version with whipped cream. Chamomile will make you sleepy - not good for movement or burning calories.	2017-05-08 13:54:05Z	Chloe

7209	It's sure as heck has information on food and nutrition! For example: "Is whole wheat bread better than white bread?".

7176	I see, however there are a lot of reasons for abdominal cramps, specifying more details may help. Depending on the reasons for the pain, also changes what methods work better on the pain.

7071	Voting to close because too many questions and way too broad. First, I doubt there's a prognosis for asthma in general since every patient is different, even to a homeopath. And although I haven't looked, I'll be surprised if there are any credible studies comparing the effectiveness of homeopathic and allopathic treatments for asthma because most mainstream researchers don't think homeopathic treatments are worth spending time on and most homeopaths don't bother doing any research at all.	2016-06-10 21:07:03Z	Carey Gregory
7071	I'll restructure the question to meet the standards. But I wonder you may be able to answer the title question, "can homeopathy cure asthma?"	2016-06-11 12:08:36Z	
7071	Or at least guide me,  which one is good	2016-06-11 12:12:58Z	
7060	1 kg of body fat is about 8000 Kcal and someone of your weight running for an hour will burn something of the order of 1000 Kcal. A basal metabolic rate of 1500 Kcal is quite realistic for someone your length, so an energy deficit of 1000 Kcal is possible. This would have led to 2 kg weight loss in 16 days, which is pretty much what you've measured.	2016-06-10 05:28:50Z	Count Iblis
7060	So not attributed to salt?	2016-06-10 08:03:27Z	
7060	I don't think so (at least not that most of the 2 kg is lost fluids), but you can just monitor your weight loss during the next two weeks and see you continue to lose weight at this rate. If you keep on exercising at the current intensity and frequency and you keep on eating 1500 Kcal you should continue to lose weight at pretty much this rate until you near certain limits for recuperation. Recuperation from exercise also requires energy, as you lose fat reserves the energy per unit time that can be extracted from fat will fall short, you may then start to feel tired and hungry.	2016-06-10 17:58:50Z	Count Iblis
7060	I don't think 2 kilos in 15 days is a surprising amount of weight loss given your calorie restriction and exercise level. Sure, reducing your sodium intake almost certainly caused some water loss, but how much was water, how much was fat, and how much was muscle is a difficult question and you haven't provided the data that would allow a reasonable estimate.	2016-06-10 21:26:41Z	Carey Gregory
7060	I have always exercised, so only 2 things changed. Salt from 6000 mg a day to 1000 mg, and calories from 2500 to 1500	2016-06-12 10:00:49Z

7051	What makes you believe blood donation will form a scar? I have multiple blood samples, IVs etc done every month and while scars are forming inside my veins according to the people who have to get the needles in, I see nothing on the outside, on my skin. I have never heard of someone worrying about scars from donating blood.	2017-12-09 15:46:10Z	Kate Gregory
7051	@KateGregory I have donated blood 4 times now from the same spot (on the inside of my right hand's elbow) and there's a scar formation visible. So I believe scar formation is inevitable when neddle is used at the exact same spot repeatedly. I'm not sure about the science behind your assertion, though, and I'm sure there must be some science behind it. That's why this question.	2018-01-04 11:43:38Z	
7050	I'm thinking because they hurt more and/or draw blood faster. Regular blood tastes maybe take up one or two small tubes, not entire IV blood packs.	2016-06-09 18:16:15Z	Daniel

7049	@Bradman175 It does not appear that liver is what is damaged by excess sugar.

7036	You seem to be equating genetics with medical history but the two are not the same. A family history of certain diseases increases your chances of getting those diseases, but it's rarely as strong a risk factor as your own medical history. Both have to be considered and neither can be ignored, but your history is virtually always a more powerful predictor than anything about your siblings, identical twins or not. (And you do mean identical twins, right? Fraternal twins share no more DNA than any other pair of siblings.)	2016-06-08 22:44:47Z	Carey Gregory
7036	The answer is likely to be "it depends on which risk you are talking about; some are cumulative, some are memoryless".  (An example of a memoryless risk is jumping out of an airplane.  An example of a cumulative risk is smoking.)  As a result, the question seems too broad.  To make this answerable, I suggest editing the question to focus on a single specific risk, rather than asking about all possible risks.	2016-07-05 18:47:16Z	D.W.
7036	You can answer this one with a quick thought experiment. Picture any element of medical history ever, and look into whether or not it causes long-term biological changes. For example, childhood obesity can increase number of fat cells in the human body, which can make it harder for the body to lose weight later on, and therefore increases risks of weight gain and associated conditions. If some condition leaves known effects, then there's clearly a memory effect. If a condition doesn't, it could be that there is no memory effect, or maybe just that the associated effects are not yet known.	2016-07-07 20:35:06Z	TheEnvironmentalist

7072	If you are interested in long term effect 1 year is not really enough. We should wait 5-10 years and look for studies about effects on health on people using soylent almost exclusively or exclusively for that amount of time.	2016-06-10 11:38:24Z

6999	So you mean some gangster could kill another gangster in the hospital by faking ID? It all depends how serious the hospital is when checking ID.	2016-06-06 23:36:36Z	Bradman175
6999	@Bradman175 Not at all. If I happen to share Billy Jones' last name, my legitimate ID will match me to my identity. That's not the problem. How does the hospital know whether we are related, or simply share a last name?	2016-06-08 05:32:06Z	
6999	Are you asking only about decision-making? I have visited out-of-hours by claiming to be a sister of the patient, and nobody asked me to prove it. I've spent a lot of time in hospitals, as patient and as visitor, and nobody has ever asked anyone for ID. But the patient has always been conscious, so I can't speak to your specific situation.	2017-02-11 18:11:12Z	Kate Gregory
6999	Also, closely related people often do not share the same name. Of the nearby family members that I would trust to make medical decisions for me in an emergency, there are five different last names and none of those names are the same as mine. If a doctor were to go looking for someone with the same last name as me, they would likely find someone that I do not know well enough to trust.	2017-03-06 16:34:40Z	Robert Columbia

5974	You're an adult male, exercising at a fairly intense level, you've already lost 30 pounds, and you're only eating 1500 to 1700 calories per day? No, it is not possible you're consuming too many calories; you're not consuming enough. It's highly probable you're adding muscle, which weighs more than fat, and that's good but you need to support that muscle growth. Your scale is lying to you about how much fat you've lost because of the muscle addition. I recommend finding a competent trainer for advice. You're restricting calories too much.	2016-06-04 03:57:06Z	Carey Gregory

5961	I know you've already marked an answer as accepted, but everything you describe is screaming out 100% 'Health Anxiety', a condition recognised by the NHS in the UK. There are tablets which help, but ultimately it needs CBT or similar to improve the situation.

5961	From a medical provider's perspective, our #1 intervention for health anxiety is to establish a strong partnership relationship with the patient with frequent followup to evaluate, educate, monitor and reassure. The internet is a great source of information, but only if you know what is reputable AND what is APPLICABLE.  The latter requires medical education and experience. So in summary, find a compassionate primary care physician and a psychologist who specifically does CBT. Actually I highly recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for ANY kind of anxiety.	2017-01-25 05:42:45Z	DoctorWhom

5959	They have removed my post which says that there is nothing bad if you mix the waters just a second before you drink it. They cannot tolerate this fact. They cannot stand the fact that it ridiculous to spread virulent germs though the cold water and preserve the germs there using low temperature. People say that they must stay blind thinking that mixture can be dangerous, unlike cold water because cold water stays cold in your guts, once you drink it. People cannot tolerate even a bit of logic. You must torture yourself drinking hot and cold water separately. Do not violate the blind custom.	2016-12-01 12:15:49Z	Little Alien

5934	It seems that athletes do tend to have a higher hba1c than average. But they also have far lower incidence of diabetes. This suggests that hba1c might give false positives for athletes.

5910	This has been asked so many times that there is really no need for a formal answer, to be honest. If you eat above your body's  calorific needs then you will put on weight. If you don't, then you will lose weight. When your body no longer has any use for the protein  (Broken down) beyond, being used as a building block, it's converted into glucose for energy. There's nothing more major,  to it.

5899	You are describing a pacemaker. Precisely why we can pace bradycardia but not asystole is a good question.	2016-05-27 13:22:42Z	Susan
5899	@Susan - Exactly, hope it's clear that's my question.  I.e., "Got an arrhythmia, fibrillation, or any other heartbeat malfunction?  No problem!  This tiny electrical jolt will get you back on track.  But heart stopped altogether?  All we can do it physically pound on it and see if it decides to start again!"	2016-05-27 14:47:57Z	
5899	The contrast of interest, in my mind, is not between defibrillation (for VF/VT) and lack thereof (for asystole) but between pacing (for bradycardia) and lack thereof (for asystole). Defibrillation depolarizes the muscle to momentarily stop conduction and terminate an arrhythmia -- it's obvious why this isn't helpful for asystole (cf. Why is defibrillation in asystole (“flat line”) useless?). But pacing.... I've always wondered exactly how long the pause needs to be before you call it "cardiac arrest" and therefore can't pace.	2016-05-27 15:13:02Z	Susan
5899	(P.S. CPR is not generally expected to coax the heart into restarting. It only maintains a semblance of circulation while hopefully some other intervention is offered.)	2016-05-27 15:15:20Z	Susan
5899	@Susan Are pacemakers only for bradycardia? I thought there were some implantable devices that could also treat fibrillation. In any case, it would be great to get a cardiologist to weigh in here. For example, there are surgeries during which the heart is stopped and later restarted: How?  And going back to the trauma case: If they actually have the chest cavity open and the heart stops why do they manually compress it instead of strapping on emergency "pacemaker" electrodes to stimulate it through a perfect heartbeat? (Also, if CPR and epinephrine don't fix asystole, what intervention can?)	2016-05-27 15:38:14Z	
5886	Glycemic loads are affected by many factors including personal differences, so I do not believe it is possible to calculate glycemic loads of mixed meals with accuracy of any practical meaning.

5861	When I look for the exact words you wrote in your previous comment I find the tablets, but not capsules. The name of the manufacturer would still be of great help. Thanks!	2016-05-22 14:31:42Z	Lucky
5861	It's not solely magnesium. Omeprazole magnesium is the chemical name, with the omeprazole compound being bound to a magnesium ion for what looks like formulation stability reasons. So the drug is not omeprazole + magnesium. There's a picture of the chemical structure a few paragraphs down on this page:prilosecotc.com/en-us/hcp/prilosec-otc-dosage             Although I'm not finding what it is, however...	2016-08-22 20:38:32Z	TheChinBurglar

5855	More information is needed, such as age_of_patient. This information can help us determine if the apex (root) is still open or not, which has a direct effect on the chances that it will revascularise and remain without symptoms. I would not discount the possibility of a root canal in the future if other problems arise. The fact that it became firmer could indicate that the gums and the tooth are reattaching normally.	2016-08-03 04:22:03Z	enap_mwf

5847	@CareyGregory the "debate" is between people who believe in the scientific method vs. nutcases that think naturopathy blogs always tell the gospel truth, because their aunt's sister-in-law's nephew once heard this thing on the radio.	2016-05-20 21:47:06Z	MattDMo

5843	short answer, no one really knows.  medscape.com/viewarticle/846218 But it can't all be due to cytokines and cortisol since RA patients also experience gelling during the day.	2016-05-18 04:21:37Z	Graham Chiu

5843	I have a reactive arthritis and it is the other way around for me. I feel great in the morning, but after a long day with lots of walking, standing, sitting etc. my feet get swollen and hot. So, basically resting, elevating and ice calm my inflammation and swelling. Especially sleeping is great.	2016-10-21 01:18:31Z	user10321
5840	This isn't a great question, but it's at least okay.  It's worth at least one point.  So I gave it its first upvote.  1.  Did you ask your question to your dentist?  If so, what did he say?  2.  Can you go to a second dentist for a free second opinion?  Please edit your question and let us know.	2016-05-17 23:45:53Z	unforgettableid
5840	He told me he would put a crown after the root canal. He's the one who put the tooth back in. Going to another dentist would cost me $200+ for examination/x-rays I just want to know if doing a root canal without a crown is plausible.	2016-05-18 00:10:53Z	
5840	A properly installed crown doesn't fall off in a couple years. Aside from that, nobody here can offer better advice than your dentist. He has examined you, we have not. He has a dentistry license, we do not.	2016-06-17 14:59:59Z	Carey Gregory

5825	What type or category of burn wounds are you referring to specifically? Because it varies!	2016-05-16 17:22:25Z	Kenny Dabiri
5825	I don't have citations to support this at hand, and no time to go find them, but as taught to me in my EMS training it's simply that cooling the burn takes longer than people realize when the burns are serious and deep. From my personal experience, I found that to be true. You could dump liters of water on a severe burn, think you've got it cooled down, and then find a few minutes later once the initial cooling of the water had vanished that their flesh was still palpably hot. Think about roasting a chunk of meat and you can see that common sense also says it's true.	2016-06-17 03:52:09Z	Carey Gregory
5825	Cooling induces vasoconstriction and then prevent inflammation by lowering spread of inflammation factor.	2016-08-16 18:07:52Z	Blue_Elephant

5818	The knowledge we have about the food we eat has been passed on from generation to generation long before modern science came into existence. Basically, you've been told to eat your vegetables by your mother who was told the same by her mother etc. etc, you could probably trace this back to the time before modern humans even existed. The question that then arises is how to even define the problem when evaluating foods we eat. E.g. broccoli is not some drug designed to solve some specific medical problem, so you don't have a well defined end point you can test.	2016-05-17 06:02:25Z	Count Iblis

5814	Unless the culprit was ingested with the previous 2 hours, it's extremely unlikely that vomiting cleared much of anything. Whatever you ate or drank during the last 48 hours or so that caused the reaction had almost certainly already left your stomach and entered your intestines by the time you vomited. Vomiting does not clear the intestines, only the stomach. Most likely you would have escaped the fate of the others no matter what you did. You probably just didn't get as large a dose of whatever it was.	2016-05-19 21:17:06Z	Carey Gregory
5813	There is something called postprandial hypostension  that can manifest alone or with other disease processes, however you cannot be sure it's that. Please consult a doctor for these symptoms as we can not be sure it's that. Thanks!	2016-05-14 22:12:16Z	Pobrecita
5813	I noticed that the fall in B.P. only happens when I eat bread and butter where the butter is mixed with Canola Oil (to make it spreadable straight out of the refrigerator). If I omit the butter and eat everything else I do not get the drop in pressure. Is there something about Canola Oil that affects B.P.?	2016-05-14 22:31:13Z	
5813	There are many articles about canola oil or cooking oil for lowering blood pressure. But that is a different question all together.	2016-05-15 04:27:43Z	Pobrecita
5813	I tried switching from the butter to margarine. No change. Same result. After I eat breakfast I have a fall in blood pressure. This morning it got down to 80/55. It appears that changing what I eat has no effect.. . .  What is going on here?	2016-05-15 21:07:53Z	
5813	It sounds a bit like postprandial hypotension, but obviously nobody on the internet can tell you what's causing it. Have you consulted a doctor?	2016-05-15 21:48:24Z	Carey Gregory

5797	I know women who traveled by car regularly for thirty minutes while pregnant. However, if the woman has any concerns she should consult her doctor/physician. What are the conditions of travel--you already said by car, but over what terrain? How long will the woman remain at the destination? What activity is being done at the destination? Will the same travel be made as a return trip identical to the departing trip? These are questions for additional information that will affect the quality of the answer you receive. Again, good reason to have a conversation with your healthcare providers.	2016-05-12 15:30:50Z	tniles09

5784	I've personally seen runners do short, quick breaths, and I've tried it myself. I'm having trouble finding good video clips of this, but here's one (this video is advertising it more as an exercise at this moment in the video, but it at least portrays the general idea). This is certainly not restricted to only weightlifters. Note that this is also a topic of interest to martial artists, and I was trying to find a jiujitsu clip that might demonstrate a similar idea.	2016-05-13 19:34:33Z

5784	I can certainly migrate it, but I don't think you're going to get much better of an answer there. Breathing, especially of this type, is highly individual, and everyone has their own preferences. I can look, but I'm not aware of any studies done on breathing patterns and efficiency (But then again, I've never really looked for them either). If you want me to migrate it, I will.	2016-05-21 00:45:45Z	JohnP

Unfortunately, they're quite expensive and not comfortable at all in warm weather.	2016-05-04 14:42:38Z	Carey Gregory

5665	Well of course I have done research for myself, but I'm here because I don't know where to go from the basic cycles (at what times what hormones are most active etc.)	2016-08-19 00:44:03Z	
5665	An interesting question. For future reference, it is always good idea to share some of your research in the question, so the people answering it have a starting point.	2016-11-30 01:39:37Z	Lucky
5660	I haven't found any answer so far.	2016-07-24 15:55:44Z	
5660	So I am still interested if someone has any idea.	2016-07-24 15:55:45Z	
5658	@Pobrecita The OP isn't asking for diagnosis, they are asking "which type of doctor should I see" and these questions fall under health-system questions and are in fact on-topic. See this meta post.	2016-04-28 22:03:05Z	Lucky
5658	Why do you think something's wrong with you? Does it cause you pain? Many people, including myself, pop various joints. I've been popping my fingers since I was a kid and it's done me no apparent harm. I also pop my neck, back and shoulders with no apparent harm.	2016-04-28 22:54:59Z	Carey Gregory
5651	It's extremely unlikely that strangers on the internet are going to think of possibilities your doctors haven't considered. A more productive approach if your doctors are stumped is finding new doctors to take a fresh look at it. Don't be shy about asking for second, third and fourth opinions.	2016-04-28 02:00:49Z	Carey Gregory
5651	@CareyGregory you are right Sir. I' ll definitely do that.	2016-04-28 05:07:08Z	
5651	Sounds like you have typical case of health anxiety which is causing a mix of problems. I suffered, and still stuff from health anxiety, its the thought process and you constantly scanning your body for problems that are not actually there. The constant scanning your body for sensations, pains and combined with the worry actually stress on your body and creates tension in blood vessels and muscles, this actually creates pain. I went 6 years of my life believing my chest pain could kill me at any moment, the first 3 years they said it was GERD or Heart... test after test... nothing.	2016-05-07 13:09:54Z	Simon Hayter
5651	6 years they tried to find a cause but couldn't, they finally diagnosed me with suspected nerve damage as they had ruled everything else out... even the best MRI in the world can't pickup low grade nerve damage. Once I accepted that the pain might be not life threatening, nor treatable, the pain actually got better &  manageable, sometimes I feel mild pain, other times not at all. Its normally very painful when I have stress, or have anxiety... Ask your doctor for Health Anxiety Counselling along with continuing to do tests on you.	2016-05-07 13:21:25Z	Simon Hayter
5651	Yep, health anxiety affected my body, my digestive system to be precise everything else is clear. I believe I'll conquer it though.	2016-05-07 13:26:26Z	
5650	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's not about health.	2016-04-28 03:54:08Z	Carey Gregory
5650	Welcome to Health SE! Your post seems to not be about a health issue. Thus it will probably be closed. If you will like to edit it that is your choice and may delay its being closed. Consulting the Help Center will help you construct a better post. Good luck and see you around!	2016-04-28 05:12:51Z	Pobrecita
5649	Just for the record. They called me back and scheduled it for tomorrow, but my question still stands.	2016-04-27 17:22:56Z	
5649	I don't understand your question. I agree that if it's an emergency you should go to A&E (ER in the US). So why would you call your doctor instead? It's not clear what you're asking.	2016-04-28 03:57:51Z	Carey Gregory
5649	My doctor offers 'emergency appointments', which is common in the UK. I'm just not sure how it is graded. Is it dying, going to die soon, in ain, stands to be in pain without meds etc..	2016-04-28 08:45:52Z	
5643	You have to be more precise. Do you have any other symptoms, did you pull/stretch a muscle maybe, do you take any medications (side effects), your stress/anxiety levels, your age etc.. It could be loads of things but it can also be nothing serious...	2016-04-27 12:28:30Z	eugene_sunic
5643	Welcome to health SE :-). Personal medical advice is strictly off-topic here, so I'm voting to close. For more information please have a look at the help center. A suspicion of a heart disease is a serious one, so a visit to the doctor's is definitely in order.	2016-04-28 03:12:43Z	Lucky
5643	As Lucky says, this is an off topic subject. I would, however, encourage you to visit your personal medical provider. Chest pains, whether they seem innocuous or not are not something to be dismissed or taken lightly.	2016-04-28 03:58:41Z	JohnP

5631	What does "balance it out" mean?	2016-04-26 02:05:23Z	Carey Gregory
5631	It's not really clear what you mean by "balance", if you could explain what you mean, and why you think you've had "too much sugar", this could possibly be answered. Please edit the question and it can be nominated for reopening.	2016-04-26 15:54:03Z	JohnP
5631	I understand the question clearly. It seems that Aziz assumes that too much sugar is bad for you (which can be true) and now thinks he needs to do something to neutralize its effects. The answer can be quite simple, so I think this can be reopened...	2016-04-27 07:11:10Z	Jan

5608	Test on the internet can't diagnose you. You need to consult your doctor and research Dementia. This will give you a better understanding of what's going on and if you have other conditions. Alzheimer's is unlikely to affect someone so young, it usually affects people older than 50, however I don't think it's impossible so seeking medical attention is important. Good luck.	2016-04-24 13:09:18Z	Pobrecita
5608	@Pobrecita thank you for your response and your time, sure test on the internet can't diagnose me, but they can an idea, for exemple see this link : alz.org/alzheimers_disease_10_signs_of_alzheimers.asp, points 1, 3 (not always), 5, 6, 9, 10 happens to me, i couldn't memorize these points while reading, so i opened block and write them down while reading (that's what usualy i do for remembring), and as you said i will consult my doctor :)	2016-04-24 13:46:55Z

5569	+0. What dose are you taking? How often are you taking it? Why are you taking it? Please re-ask a new, more-detailed question, then add a comment to Slazer's old answer to notify him that you've asked a revised version of your question. (Slazer can then answer the new question and flag the old question as a duplicate of the new question.) Most healthy adults using immediate-release melatonin should not need to take more than 1 mg at a time. The more of anything you take, the greater your risk of unwanted adverse effects.	2016-05-17 16:43:06Z	unforgettableid
5555	"Longterm use" is not an absolute term, although it might be defined one way or another in a given study. In order to meaningfully answer this question I think it needs to be about one drug or drug class (PPIs would be fine) and a particular outcome that you think might ensue due to "longterm use". We could then (attempt to) find research about what the time course of developing such outcome actually is.	2016-04-21 13:49:27Z	Susan
5555	I see, tnx for the comment. I got a clearer view now. It would be nice if you could extend your comment to form a decent answer.	2016-04-21 14:37:40Z

5524	@Susan I could express it as the difference in metabolism but I was affraid I wouldn't learn about any other important changes in body, so I chose to ask so that would be clear I'm not interested in psychological difference or the fact you for example eat dispersed sugar usually contained less sweat food (beverages).	2016-05-08 05:37:51Z

5519	You may technically be obese, but so is 35% or more of the USA population.  So, you don't have an eating disorder as we'd normally classify, nor would one call it an addiction.  You need to rephrase the question asking what are the best ways to lose weight.	2016-04-24 05:29:01Z	Graham Chiu
5519	@Graham We can't know whether the OP has an eating disorder or any other condition based solely on the information provided over the internet. Health SE can not be a place to make a diagnosis or state that someone doesn't have one.	2016-04-27 03:10:41Z	Lucky
5519	If you think of food as sustenance rather than entertainment, it might help, but changing one's mindset can be difficult.	2016-04-29 22:00:41Z	BillDOe

5507	The best treatment is to visit an endocrinologist and find out why you have a hormonal imbalance and get that fixed. If it's due to steroid abuse, stopping the steroids would be a good first step.

5491	Welcome to health SE :-). The general answer would be that food might interfere with the medicine, but there are many different interactions - if you edit your question to make it more specific (name a medicine or a group of medicines) we could write a more detailed answer explaining specific interactions in that particular case.

5487	@BenCannon I've used quite a number over the years and cannot enumerate them all, but none have yielded good results.  Most recently I've taken bacillus coagulans (5B) which seemed to do nothing. About a year ago, I took this from GNC and became extremely ill about a week after taking it with serious GI complications and have had to be on a periodic PPI since. Obviously my goal here is to REMOVE the guesswork and find out if there are genetic markers that indicate successful regimen per alleles, even if I have to manually pour over appropriate studies.	2016-04-15 19:41:00Z

5473	Welcome to health SE :-). The economic details (such as the cases in which you would be charged for a service) would depend on your location, healthcare financing system etc. But from a health perspective - if the doctor prescribed such a diagnostic procedure, he probably had a reason. Whether your symptoms are urgent or not is up to your doctor to decide, we cannot do it on-line, and if you are not a physician you probably can't either.	2016-04-14 04:34:16Z	Lucky
5473	This is something you should definitely talk to your doctor about, as it may be something that could really benefit from early detection/confirmation, whether or not you think it is urgent. Unfortunately, however, the question itself is asking for personal medical advice, which isn't on topic for the site.	2016-04-14 21:49:45Z	JohnP
5473	All the comments advise contacting the doctor so that constitutes personal advice.  So, you're giving personal advice and answering the question at the same time saying you can't.	2016-04-14 23:57:08Z	Graham Chiu

5470	@CareyGregory I'm aware that there are all sorts of parasites, that's why my question consist specific strand of the parasite as example to follow.	2016-04-14 10:15:30Z	
5470	I think that without even limiting it to intestinal parasites, it's definitely too broad.  Just giving an example of a parasite doesn't really limit the scope.  The way you check for pubic lice has no relation to the way you check for hookworms.  I can point to whole textbooks on the subject, making me think that it is too broad in its current form.	2016-04-14 14:30:00Z	Atl LED

I think that the question "can something in one's diet cause bloating, fouls smelling gas, abnormal bowel movement and pain" can be on topic, but nonetheless - if the symptoms persist it is a good idea to consult with your doctor. Good luck :-)	2016-04-11 08:32:24Z	Lucky
5430	Sites like that give nutritional medicine a bad name, and the few accurate things he says are unfortunately muddied by association with the rest.

5395	+1 to Chiu's awnser, I just thought I might mention something that you might also find interesting is some of the related work ICBG is doing. Though they aren't working with papaya, I recently saw some interesting data on Cyanobacteria.  There is discussion of NCCIH putting out awards for extracts against Flaviviridae in general, but that hasn't happened yet.

5394	Approximately 8000 Kcal. But in practice you'll end up having to eat more to keep up with higher exercise intensity. You can't burn only fats, due to the fact that fat requires a lot more oxygen to burn compared to carbs,so it cannot provide you with high power. Fat is thus low octane fuel, you will burn it together with carbs.Weight loss will happen over time due to your body deciding to keep lower fat reserves, you don't have to do much for that other than exercising a lot and eating healthy foods.	2016-04-08 19:50:59Z	Count Iblis
5394	You should check the supertracker supertracker.usda.gov/bwp/index.html developed by the NIH is based on this article thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60812-X/… which represents, to date, the best method for estimating weight loss (the author shows this in the article).

5361	Thanks for the comment - I am not asking for personal medical advice. My question is how do certain actions which enhance the respiratory system / lung function actually do so? In other words, what are the specific somatic changes that are caused by cardio or deep breathing exercises for instance? Also, what are other actions that can improve lungs / breathing (perhaps there's a dietary factor)?  How do those actions do it?	2016-04-09 20:52:08Z

5345	Jet fuel is very similar to kerosene. Do you get the same nausea around a burning kerosene lamp?	2016-04-05 17:42:02Z	Jack Swayze Sr
5345	I feel as though this is bordering the line between educational and professional medical advice. That being said I'd try what Jack said. Kerosene, and other fuels, can cause nausea for people when it's too concentrated in the air. As long as you aren't also experiencing chest pains and/or stomach pains you should be fine. The smell may also be from the smell of the cleaner they use to clean the aircraft. Though don't quote me on that.	2016-04-06 03:33:38Z	FrankyG
5345	@JackSwayzeSr I'm not sure where I could go to be around a kerosene lamp but I've certainly never had the same feeling around anything over than jet aircraft.	2016-04-07 20:33:41Z	
5342	Was the bottle exposed to direct sunlight (and if yes is it a dark bottle)? I am guessing the peptides are in a solution (not a powder)? Is there any reference by the manufacturer about keeping them at room temperature (for some peptides that are meant to be kept in a fridge a window of time at room temperature is allowed but it mainly depends on the peptide and the formulation - any further detail that you can/are comfortable to provide will help us answer the question).	2016-04-04 17:33:37Z	Lucky
5342	@Lucky all good questions. Yes, the peptides were already activated (not powder) and it was a clear bottle. There was no direct sunlight on it. I was not given express directions to keep it refrigerated but I have heard this is standard practice with peptides because they can be delicate.	2016-04-04 17:49:33Z	
5340	Unfortunately, we can't tell you if your rice was undercooked or if there is a health issue. I would encourage you to talk with your personal care provider with these questions.	2016-04-04 17:48:12Z	JohnP
5340	What if I asked "is it plausible that rice is found in stool due to it being undercooked if no other symptoms are detected?" As a general question rather than tied to a personal situation? Would it be on topic with health stackexchange? Genuinely curious here	2016-04-05 06:40:23Z	
5340	It could be on topic depending on phrasing, but the answer is the same. Could possibly be undercooked, could possibly be a medical issue.	2016-04-05 14:37:14Z	JohnP
5338	Hi user3356, this isn't the right place to get a diagnosis for your personal symptoms. Please discuss this with a clinician instead. On this site you can ask general questions about health, but I can't see a good way to generalize this one. Thanks.	2016-04-07 02:10:31Z	Susan

5308	Did you ever have any seizures? This may seem dumb, but the question only said you had been on the seizure meds.	2016-04-02 03:01:31Z	Pobrecita
5308	Yeah I had it since a young age apparently and exclusively while sleeping at night. I used to wake up with strong headaches. The medication was taken for several years and I came out of it completely around 5 years ago. It's been so long, so I can't remember when I stopped taking the medication. Have not seen any symptoms of seizures at all since then, so I'm wondering if that condition is relevant at this point or not.	2016-04-02 03:05:29Z	
5304	An interesting, but complex question. I could answer how much would it  take (approximately) for the medicine to clear out of the system, but the time to restore prolactin to a normal level after that is beyond my knowledge; especially because the patient switched to a different medication - we don't know which one, so we can't know if this medication also affects prolactine levels.	2016-04-01 14:43:01Z	Lucky
5304	No other medication affects prolactin. From this moment, the time period for prolactin to restore has started.	2016-04-01 14:49:02Z

The personal medical advice questions are strictly off-topic here, as the internet cannot replace a face-to-face consultation with your (or in this case your mother's) doctor.

5261	... Definitely one of the weirder questions out there. Didn't you have basic education on such matters when you were at school? I don't think any modern person would still be told that if you simply have direct sex/sex out of marriage then you'd have AIDS. That would be ridiculous. Whether that person is married has zero impact on whether he/she has AIDS/STDs or not. They're two completely separate matters. Just do some tests if you're still afraid. That's the only way to tell. But normally I'd not worry very much.	2016-04-05 09:23:34Z	JI Xiang
5261	@Pilot Lol no you don't need to feel sorry about that. Sorry if what I said came across as a kind of rude to you. It's just that it's good to have some knowledge about sex, even if your schools were a bit conservative and didn't talk about that much. In any case, the percentage of population with AIDS is really small and countless people have sex every day, and they certainly don't worry too much when doing it. So it should be fine for you as well.	2016-04-05 17:17:53Z	JI Xiang

5250	I was referring to the plant the oil is extracted form, not the brand.. But if you use all six of these (eucalyptus, lavender, peppermint, sweet orange, lemon and tea tree) interchangeably and sometimes don't even use the essential oils then I'm lost since these were my only "suspects" in your formulation. Maybe someone else can crack this :-)	2016-03-27 11:18:38Z	Lucky

5243	Can you specify whether you are also asking about "health risks for... the newborn"?

5237	@Lucky I don't believe so. Could caffeine be triggering it?	2016-03-26 23:49:53Z	
5237	I don't have time to do sufficient research for a proper answer at the moment, but I'll try to explain without answering in comments (because that's not allowed here): I wasn't referring to caffeine causing headaches directly, but since it can affect the diameter of blood vessels in the brain and cerebral blood flow and it might affect blood pressure, I thought that weather the coffee had caffeine might be a relevant piece of information for your question. It is not necessarily relevant,  but it might be, and the more details we have, the better.	2016-03-27 03:01:02Z	Lucky
5234	Generally the SE model is to have one question per post. However, I think your 4 points are close enough they could be answered with the same research. This is an interesting question for sure!	2016-03-24 17:18:12Z	JohnP

5234	It's always been my understanding that ice is used on a fresh injury (within 24 hours) to reduce internal bleeding and swelling, while heat is used after 24 hours to break up the accumulated blood, thus reducing swelling and speeding healing.	2016-03-24 18:35:55Z	BillDOe

5234	@BillOer - That is the common lore, Franky is asking if that has been proven to be the most effective method, or if it's just something that is known because it's repeated a lot. FWIW, I have found mixed results when looking for studies. Still looking.	2016-03-25 03:32:21Z	JohnP
5230	I'm trying not to be judgemental here, but it sounds like you've become dependent on adrenaline to be productive (or at least feel productive). Very few jobs generate a lot of adrenaline, and in those that do you'll generally find that adrenaline is actually your enemy that you have to learn to control (police, firefighting, combat soldier, etc). I'm afraid the bad news is that life is not a video game.	2016-03-23 23:40:01Z	Carey Gregory
5230	@CareyGregory i never said life is a video game, it's kind of a game however. Plus I answered my own question by saying it only occurs (when i'm working) at night, which means I'm more awake then, I normally play video games at night. I actually get very tired playing games during the day. Just need to go to sleep earlier.	2016-03-28 13:52:05Z	
5218	It very hard to find the reason of it but I suggest that you may do trial and error for every reason you gave in your question.	2016-03-23 13:42:54Z	bantandor

5210	Look up body fat percentage. BMI is a universal number -- universally useless, misleading and stupid.	2016-03-22 19:40:27Z	Carey Gregory
5210	@CareyGregory there are certainly issues with it, but it is far from useless. It provides a simple and accessible way to track and set goals for weight and when used as a statistical measure, we can use it to identify correlations to health.	2016-03-23 06:13:48Z	
5210	Sure, assuming the person isn't physically fit and muscular, in which case the number is extremely misleading. A measure with such a huge limitation that has no way of expressing that limitation is so flawed as to be useless.	2016-03-23 13:52:08Z	Carey Gregory
5210	@CareyGregory You're looking at it from the point of view of an individual (and of course every individual is different). I am talking about statistics. When you look at a sufficiently large sample size, then you can make generalised correlations. In the same way that you can say "males are more likely to have a car accident than females" and that information is useful for calculating insurance premiums, but that doesn't mean it applies to a specific male who happens to be a very skilled and careful driver.	2016-03-23 15:06:01Z	
5210	Your second question was if there's a more accurate way to determine optimal weight. I would say yes, and it's not BMI. Body fat % works for all body types across all populations. BMI does not.	2016-03-23 19:08:16Z	Carey Gregory

5202	I think it's clear enough but it's really a very broad question. Too broad, in fact. I think to make it answerable you would need to narrow it down to a single nutrient.	2016-03-23 15:05:38Z	Carey Gregory
5202	Hi :-) Your question, though an interesting one, is on a road to be closed, for being too broad. I strongly suggest that you pick one particular vitamin or nutrient to narrow your question down. Thanks!	2016-03-26 07:06:45Z	Lucky
5199	Welcome to health SE :-). I'm not sure that this is on topic (personal medical advice isn't), but I,m not going to vote to close just yet. In general, it is unwise to ignore your doctor's advice especially regarding the increase of a dose. Such a large increase should not be done by yourself or by following advice on the internet. You can read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine, and look at the section adverse effects.	2016-03-22 11:30:47Z	Lucky
5199	@Lucky - This walks a fine line, I'll agree. Without the personal details, the basic question is "If X dose reduces inflammation, would X*2 dose reduce it even further?" which is on topic. But, the intent behind it makes it personal. As with you, I will wait (Since my close vote is like a presidential veto :p)	2016-03-22 14:50:19Z	JohnP

5179	From the Toxicological Function of Adipose Tissue article you linked; these POP's haven't been associated with any severe toxic outcomes in humans yet. So we don't know what toxic effects we would be trying to prevent. As far as increasing excretion instead of redistribution this could be difficult as well. Current methods of increasing excretion of toxic substances usually involve altering urinary pH to allow the substance to be more soluble in urine and get excreted faster. According to the article POP's tend to be excreted in feces, so this method would not apply. Interesting question.	2016-08-22 18:05:21Z	TheChinBurglar

I'd interpret "for occasional sleeplessness" as "if you suffer from more than that, get something else / see a doctor, because this won't solve your problem", not as "this isn't safe for long-term use".

5164	Hepatitis A clearly exists and shows up in Google searches, so I'm guessing you're talking about Google hits with respect to searches involving complications of two diseases.  And I agree - there seems to be nothing online about it!  The original source and basis for my question is House M.D., season 6 or 7.  The entire cast agrees that, given a patient who has Hepatitis C, if they infect him with Hepatitis A, there is a 15% it will cure him outright, but an 85% chance it will kill him.  The entire cast went along with this plot point.	2016-03-24 20:45:36Z

5129	The result of an APTT test is measured in seconds - do you mean that the blood never clotted?	2016-03-14 09:28:25Z	YviDe
5129	To make this clearer: there is no APTT in blood that can be missing - the APTT measures how many seconds it takes for blood to clot.	2016-03-14 13:20:25Z	YviDe
5129	"Never clotted" on assays I've seen reads out as ">150 s". Labs may differ on the upper limit, but if it's run and it doesn't clot, it should read "> x seconds" (as YviDe said, it can't really be "missing").  It is, however, possible to run a PT/INR and no (A)PTT -- do you just mean there was a blank space on the result sheet?	2016-03-14 16:34:51Z	Susan
5129	The above comments were flagged for being answers. I don't believe they are answers, as they are trying to determine what was assessed, and giving reasons why there should be something on the test related to APTT.	2016-03-14 20:54:39Z	JohnP
5129	You can always edit your question to clarify the confusion (although you've already got a proper answer). For future reference, units are very important for lab tests - if there are any you should include them. In this case if the result was measured in seconds, you can edit your question to state that.	2016-03-15 11:39:23Z	Lucky

5098	Define extract.  What are the relevant chemical compounds?	2016-03-12 16:12:51Z	jiggunjer
5098	@jiggunjer that's a good question, they talk in the video about soy beams and soy extract, but don't say what component is the one to look for in soy.	2016-03-12 16:22:39Z	
5098	According to wikipedia soy milk is simply dried soybeans ground in water, so there really isn't any "extract" to it. It's just liquid soy beans.	2016-03-13 15:36:29Z	Carey Gregory
5098	Note that "compound X has anti-angiogenic properties" does not mean "consuming some amount of compound X in food will prevent you from getting cancer". Cancer is much more complicated than that. So even if you knew exactly how much there is in the milk (and it's unlikely that each milk will have the same amount of whichever compound is relevant, if that's even known), this is no good decision criterion for drinking or not drinking soy milk.	2016-03-14 10:42:22Z	rumtscho
5079	My knee jerk reaction was to answer this, but you are asking for concrete, scientific proof.  I also could not find any real studies.  I think you will find that it is going to depend on how the protein (for example) is processed to get it into the bar.  This will vary from brand to brand.  My opinion (which is why it is here instead of in the answers section) is that "real" food will be processed better.	2016-03-10 14:41:16Z	Joe Ruder
5079	So, studies showing that they are either just as effective or even better are not okay ;-)? (I suppose they are, but your question is worded as if that wouldn't be an acceptable answer)	2016-03-10 18:03:01Z	YviDe
5079	@YviDe I would be thrilled to see a study showing that they are just as effective if you can find one. That would answer my question nicely. I guess i worded it the way I did because general consensus seems to point to nutrients from food being better than nutrients from bars. I was looking for someone to prove that so-called "common knowledge", but if you could prove the opposite I would be very happy.	2016-03-10 20:44:48Z	
5079	nutrients from food are better than from bars because of what comes along with them. Vitamin C from an apple comes with fibre and assorted phytonutrients that may not have been studied. From a carrot it comes with a different set of phytonutrients, and Vitamin A. From a bar, it's just what they chose to add, which might not be everything you need. Ditto for a pill. I doubt anyone will conclude you don't get the stuff the bar has, just that food has more stuff you're likely to need.	2016-03-10 22:46:12Z	Kate Gregory

5074	Iodine 131 has a half life of only 8 days.	2016-03-11 17:27:17Z	Count Iblis
5074	You are referring to the pure stable isotope,  not any organic compounds that may contain any,  like FDG?	2016-03-12 16:23:17Z	jiggunjer
5074	@CountIblis I corrected to iodine 129 which has a half-time of 15.7 million years.	2016-03-14 01:27:33Z	
5074	@jiggunjer I also include organic compounds that contain such isotopes. The question could be reformulated: how safe is the food which is grown on the soil that contains different kinds of radioactive isotopes and animals that are fed on such products? I guess here the isotopes become part of the organic compounds.	2016-03-14 01:31:40Z	
5074	Out of curiosity, why are you especially interested in those? An isotope with a halflife of 15 million years probably isn't even going to dacay in your body even if it's stays there until you die.	2016-03-14 13:38:35Z	YviDe
5063	Most of the physiologic effects of melatonin are predicted according to a phase response curve. Walking through the entire curve is exhausting even for a very focused question, so it would be helpful to tell us when in the circadian cycle (e.g. # of hours before habitual bedtime) you're taking it.	2016-03-08 22:10:09Z	Susan
5063	I try to take it about one to two hours before bedtime in the evening, and after I wake up is when I notice that particular benefit. I've noticed the other benefits of melatonin during the daytime, e.g., feeling relaxed by cherries or helping me nap, but I don't do this usually and don't recall if waking from a nap after melatonin caused me to crave sunshine too.	2016-03-11 03:44:46Z	
5063	I don't need to know very specific details, btw. I'm mostly just interested to know whether this phenomenon of my craving sunlight is expected/known and if so, secondarily to know for interest's sake, whether sunlight craving is something that acts by a mechanism other than melatonin but is shut off by melatonin deficiency or whether the craving is directly increased by the presence of melatonin.	2016-03-11 03:45:45Z	
5062	That would require knowing which components of gelatin are responsible for those benefits, and that doesn't appear to be known. Significant evidence that those benefits are real doesn't exist either.	2016-03-08 22:38:07Z	Carey Gregory
5062	I was craving items with gelatin before I even knew that the item (at least bone soup) was comprised of gelatin, and it is not a craving because I especially like the taste. Cravings are indicators, if imperfect ones, of deficiencies we may have, so that is sufficient evidence to me that there is at least something helpful in it that I am missing. But if it is not known what the beneficial components are, yeah, then finding a replacement is clearly going to be a problem.	2016-03-11 03:30:10Z

5054	My thinking here was to consider common diseases that you can have that can go unnoticed. E.g. it is known that many people have undiagnosed diabetes, many people have undiagnosed hypothyroidism. Also kidney function can be impaired  quite a bit (e.g. due to diabetes) without that leading to symptoms. To make the question better defined, one can ask how to choose some given number tests (say 10), of blood tests such that the survival probability after, say, ten years is optimized. This can be calculated from the known statistics.	2016-03-10 04:56:31Z	Count Iblis

5046	Making the jump from jump food to addiction in general is pretty big, in my opinion. I have been in physical pain a lot, and while I do show the behavior you mention (I just mentally can't be bothered to deal with both pain and resisting comfort food), it's not like I also crave heroin, and the word "addiction" really encompasses a lot. So, are you talking about food cravings or and kind of addiction?	2016-03-09 06:03:00Z	YviDe
5046	@YviDe I agree that the question could be narrowed by specifying that addiction in question is food addiction, but I would also like to read if someone has come across some studies that explain food addiction (are dopamine pathways involved?) and if and how this mechanism interacts with pain.	2016-03-15 11:28:09Z	Lucky

5006	Regardless of iodine, the decision to avoid all table salt seems excessive. While it’s certainly true that Western diet contains rather too much salt, the opposite isn’t great either, and moderate salt use doesn’t lead to overconsumption (ignoring for now the issue that food without added salt can simply never taste as good).	2016-03-05 14:16:40Z	Konrad Rudolph

4911	@CareyGregory, Thanks! I am curious how permanent the cause of this trouble is, but I do see some benefit in your edit. Besides, even had the condition been likely to persist, I don't know that realizing it would dramatically alter our anticipated course of action; and if time will cure it, we may well find that out anyways.	2016-02-22 14:21:40Z

4901	HIV simply is the name of a virus. Do you mean the illness that comes from infection? If so, that is basically a duplicate of Is HIV the cause of AIDS? If you are asking how the virus is infectious to humans, that is a different question.	2016-02-20 22:36:57Z	anongoodnurse
4901	Ok, so if I understand, suppose we quarantine 1000 man and 1000 woman in perfect heath in a building, if the 1000 man have sex with the 1000 woman, i.e. 1000 000 total sexual intercourse, that same for 2000 healthy men who all had sex with each other, this will not produce HIV ?	2016-02-20 22:57:00Z	
4901	If you start with men and women in perfect health, that is not infected with the virus, no amount of sexual intercourse will "produce" HIV. The virus must be present in one of the people to pass it on.	2016-02-20 22:59:17Z	anongoodnurse

4889	I don't understand why you would ask strangers on the internet whether you should ignore your dentist's advice.	2016-02-24 04:58:48Z	Carey Gregory
4889	Because the dentist didn't know the ramifications of the fillings on the invisalign treatment. And I would expect some people on the internet to have experience or knowledge on the issue.	2016-02-24 05:37:38Z

4881	once i fractured my hand and i had to go through many different health practitioners to get the proper treatment. ambulance paramedic told me it was not a fracture. in er doctor told me it was not a fracture, i asked to see xray, they cleared me to leave and called me back when i was in bus stop to tell me it was a fracture. Went to a established bone doctor who appeared in magazines, saw me 2 minutes, aid put my hand in cast, left. I did some research, concluded cast was not put right went to another doctor who took cast off, put new one as i had researched. good luck.	2016-02-24 02:51:04Z	freethinker36
4881	@freethinker36 I'm truly shocked that any paramedic would tell you a bone is not fractured seeing as how x-ray machines aren't carried on ambulances anywhere in the world I've ever heard of. The next time one does tell you that, mention it to the ER doc because that paramedic needs some refresher training. A paramedic might tell you a bone is broken because it's visibly apparent, but it's impossible to rule out a fracture without some type of imaging capability.	2016-02-24 19:04:16Z	Carey Gregory
4881	I'm closing this question as being subjective and opinion based, because doctor A may recommend surgery, doctor B might recommend a boot and doctor C might recommend complete non weight bearing, etc. Also, while there is an accepted answer, it's basically "it's fractured, this is how doctor A treated it" which is certainly personal advice, as this may or may not be applicable to someone else that has the same type of injury, and could potentially be misleading.	2016-02-26 22:11:04Z	JohnP

4875	Health.SE might not have much on this, but a quick glance shows that google is not lacking.	2016-02-19 02:49:49Z	Carey Gregory
4875	I think that downvoters wanted you to include more research from outside health SE, but many questions do get away without research. Furthermore, the less you know about a specific topic, the more difficult it is to search for answers. I'd say it is a legitimate question.	2016-02-19 15:14:32Z	Lucky
4875	There are two upvotes and two downvotes, so there's no consensus on your question. (None of the 4 votes are mine.) Although I would have liked to see a little more research, I don't think it's a bad question. I, for one, learned something.	2016-02-19 16:20:42Z	Carey Gregory
4875	Some sites require it and others don't. Stackoverflow, for example, will close questions that show no effort on the OP's part. Health seems to fall somewhere in the middle. I think prior research is desirable but I've never seen a question closed for lack of it.	2016-02-19 17:32:34Z	Carey Gregory
4875	Nobody actually says how reliable the resource you found for your question has to be, so if you could remember the name and the producer of the show that might constitute research on your behalf. After all, you didn't just invent/hypothesise that chemotherapy might be used for MS, you've heard about it somewhere. Of course, the rest of the community may not share this opinion, it's just a suggestion.	2016-02-19 18:11:50Z	Lucky
4874	Can you please name the specific antihistamine you're referring to?	2016-02-19 16:36:00Z	Carey Gregory
4874	Allergist prescribed me Rupafin (rupatadine) and Milukante (montelukast). I’ve found, now more precisely, that rupatadine is pseudo-irreversible antagonist. It differs from truly irreversible antagonist in that no covalent bond is formed with receptor. Montelukast is leukotriene antagonist but I couldn’t find anything about its reversibility.	2016-02-19 19:26:16Z	
4874	I can find nothing in the literature for either drug indicating that their effects are anything other than what I posted in my answer. Both are metabolized and eliminated from the body within hours and there is no mention of an irreversible antagonist effect. If you're convinced such an effect exists, please provide the source where you're finding this information. It's difficult to debate "I read somewhere" information.	2016-02-20 02:31:30Z	Carey Gregory

4864	First, why can't be age-related? You are presumably not a teenager any more. Also, why do you expect to be "average"? The average human is 175 cm tall, but a 30 yo who is 165 cm did not have a "height decline".	2016-02-19 09:33:14Z	rumtscho
4864	@rumtscho because looking online, age-related hearing loss is usually after 65 - not even close. I couldn't find anything about standard deviation in hearing ranges, so I assumed that it was very small.	2016-02-19 11:42:38Z	
4864	Welcome to health SE :-). It is a good idea to include your research into your question, since comments might get deleted (or overlooked if there are many of them). It would get you better answers and possibly more upvotes.	2016-02-19 15:19:38Z	Lucky
4864	rumtscho raises a good point. Did you have previous hearing tests that showed a higher range? Maybe that's been your range your entire life and there's been no decline at all. After all, above 14800 is very high and barely audible to most people.	2016-02-20 02:50:48Z	Carey Gregory
4864	Hearing is best in adolescents and starts to decline (slowly) in teenagers. If your source was talking about hearing loss after 65, they probably used some strict definition such as clinically significant hearing loss (the person starts noticing problems in everyday life and visits a doctor) - but note that a standard audiogram doesn't even go above 8 kHz. The question is still interesting though, because it invites a good explanation of hearing loss with time.	2016-02-20 16:04:50Z	rumtscho

4815	Does the microwave keep running when you open it? I have never encountered one that would do that (I'm not actually sure they can do that)	2016-02-14 23:00:19Z	YviDe
4815	@YviDe They cannot, at least in the US. FDA regulations require dual interlock devices that shut the magnetron off when the door is opened. (Now watch this comment get deleted as an answer.)	2016-02-15 05:14:04Z	Carey Gregory
4815	@YviDe As Carey wrote, I think most (if not all) microwave ovens should stop when you open the door.  But I don't know if, like a conventional oven, anything is released when you open the door without stopping it first.  With a conventional oven, it's just heat.  With a microwave oven, I don't know if more than heat is released.	2016-02-15 20:57:21Z	
4815	@RockPaperLizard Microwaves use radio waves to cook, and radio waves aren't something that can linger. Turn off that magnetron and there should be zero emissions present in nanoseconds, literally ages before the door can actually swing open.	2016-02-26 00:25:35Z	Carey Gregory
4815	@CareyGregory That's Carey, that's helpful.  A little laugh at the "literally ages" term, but on this scale, that term could actually be appropriate!	2016-02-26 00:38:07Z	
4813	Asthma is always present, even if you don't feel any symptoms. You only get the symptoms when the airways narrow due to some trigger, but the system inflammation of the airways is actually always present. This can only change on very long time scales. Medications can reduce this inflammation. This is why it is unwise to attribute changes in symptoms to the asthma becoming better or worse and  modify the medication on the basis of that.	2016-02-14 22:05:24Z	Count Iblis
4812	Ahh ok, some people feel that the question is too broad right now. Might you consider editing it a little to be descriptive of what you're after? That way your good question avoid closing. :)	2016-02-16 20:21:51Z	Dave Liu
4812	Following the edits the question seems clear enough, but there's a remaining problem. It asks for "good" resources, which is a matter of opinion. I think the question can be salvaged by replacing "good" with a more objective measure. Perhaps "widely accepted" would work?	2016-02-17 00:09:14Z	Carey Gregory
4812	@CareyGregory - Even "widely accepted" is marginal. This is basically a list question, which can make good question/answer pairs if the list in question is finite and definitive. This is really neither.	2016-02-17 15:19:08Z	JohnP
4812	@JohnP I agree; just looking for something better than "good." This is why some sites (eg, stackoverflow) prohibit questions asking for resource recommendations. They're very often subjective and ephemeral. However, this question fits neither the list of acceptable questions nor unacceptable questions. It's in a gray area, so I would tend to err on letting it stand.	2016-02-17 19:19:02Z	Carey Gregory
4812	@CareyGregory - Agreed, which is why I didn't close it already. If a good answer comes up from it, then it's a great resource question. If the community decides it is too ephemeral, then popular vote can close it.	2016-02-17 19:23:21Z	JohnP
4811	I am not sure if the question is more suitable for biology.sx. If so please tell me so that we can migrate it.	2016-02-13 18:24:30Z	
4804	This question dances close to asking for personal diagnosis, but I'll skip on vote to close for now, because it's worded well enough to possibly be a general question.	2016-02-13 19:37:40Z	Dave Liu
4804	Thank you. :) I am aware of the risks of trying to play doctor. I am not trying to diagnose myself and the person who shows these symptoms has been asked to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis. I just want to do a bit of research which will not be revealed to the person with these symptoms.	2016-02-13 20:02:20Z	
4804	Even so, the question may be rather broad. If you provided more details such as size, shape, and frequency, that might help get an answer and prevent closing due to broadness.	2016-02-13 20:05:33Z	Dave Liu

4800	@YviDe, I can play octaves, the maximum interval I can play is 10th and it's not enough for me, however augmented 10th is something I can't play, I wish I could play 11th, it's very important for me to play them, most music genres I like and most my favourite pianists had big hands and it's nearly impossible to play like them with my hands. By the way I've read links you sent me, but unfortunately they didn't help, I know all these things about stretch and other things, I've already trained them, but I still need to increase my hand size / fingers length somehow.	2016-02-20 14:07:56Z

4711	@ABcDexter I heard (from a serious sleep expert, who was rather old and performed lots of research for many years) that 90 minute segments are most useful, meaning that a 5.25 hr sleep may not be a lot better than a 4.5 hr sleep but a 4.5 hr sleep may be much better than a 3.75 hr sleep.  Sleep/rest/nap wasn't very significant, as long as you give the body appropriate time and let the body decide whether you fall unconscious or not.  I can personally attest that trying for segments of 90 minutes has seemed to minimize undesirable tiredness effects, so I guess it seems he was right.	2016-02-19 15:46:39Z	TOOGAM

4693	Yes. Would it be safe for air travel, or would another conveyance be more desirable (which would be by ship at that point)?	2016-02-07 09:57:36Z	
4685	I don't feel that "volumes" can be written about estrogen's benefits. Additionally, this question opens up discussion to more specific questions once it's addressed, i.e. "Since estrogen does X in women, should Y do Z?" or etc.	2016-02-06 23:46:36Z	
4672	If some candle has a high lead level, I wouldn't be surprised if it has negative health effects (I doubt that would be linked to cancer though?) but I am more interested in common candles. If this IS common in candles, then I would be interested in that.	2016-02-06 12:32:23Z	
4672	just to be sure you r not looking for scented candles right?	2016-02-14 14:11:50Z	M.shadow
4672	@M.shadow I didn't hear that there is a difference between them. If there is a difference, I would like that mentioned. It might be a tough question, since it is broad. I am concerned mostly with the common scented and unscented candles people find around the house, not something like mosquito-repellent candles. Is that specific enough?	2016-02-14 22:20:56Z

4652	There really is no good answer other than "when the pain goes away". Plenty of research has been done on this and absolutely none of it is conclusive. That's probably because ice doesn't really do anything to help heal but rather reduces pain and swelling. Two very superficial symptoms.  This is actually something I've already asked.	2016-04-05 14:49:16Z	FrankyG

4645	Note: this is essentially a rewritten repost of an off-topic question on cooking; we didn't migrate it because it wasn't an obvious fit in that form and the OP really wanted to be on cooking.	2016-02-03 16:58:18Z	
4643	Plus: It is a personal medical question.	2016-02-03 09:34:35Z	Chris
4643	This is more of a health advice kind of question. I am migrating this to Health but you should add more details. How tall you may grow depends on a lot of factors such as diet, physical exercise etc. So I guess this may also be considered broad. I won't be surprised if they close it.	2016-02-03 09:49:52Z	WYSIWYG
4642	I presume that by "stomach flu" you mean short-term nausea and perhaps vomiting that's usually caused by food poisoning or viral infections such as novovirus. Is that what you mean? If so, I'm a bit puzzled how someone with such an illness would want to (or even be able to) eat a plate of pasta at all, with or without cheese.	2016-02-03 05:04:44Z	Carey Gregory
4642	Not food poisoning, the other kind. It's more of an after-effect thing where, after eating nothing but crackers and other incredibly bland food, the appetite has returned while the virus is still fairly active. It's the recovery period where one wants a fuller meal, but it's still a bad idea to just drink plain milk (as an example). I'm just wondering how a little bit of cheese would effect the individual at this point in the infection.	2016-02-03 05:49:34Z	
4642	Caffeine, fatty foods and diary. Those are the three to avoid, to ensure a good recovery :-)	2016-02-04 20:20:09Z	user19679
4642	So it's a substance issue rather than quantity? Just avoid any amount of dairy?	2016-02-05 06:03:53Z	
4642	Hmm, sort of. A very small amount would go unnoticed but, a large amount would not (visually). There's fat in mostly all foods, just not as much as you would find in dairy. It's difficult to describe, to be honest. And I'd be culled if I were to answer in the comments. Unless it would be a very small amount, I'd stay away from it, considering that you're stomach will be very sensitive at this moment in time. A small sprinkle of cheese wouldn't harm you, however.	2016-02-05 12:24:58Z	user19679
4629	I don't know, but I think you answered (in the body of your post) the question you ask at the end. Is your question, "is prophylactic drug use ever warranted?" If it's not, and only limited to antibiotics, why should antibiotic use as a prophylactic be treated differently?	2016-02-02 18:37:17Z	anongoodnurse
4629	Oh, I see that someone on Skeptics also noted that your question contained the answer. Maybe it needs refocusing?	2016-02-02 18:43:07Z	anongoodnurse

Every proof starts from just idea. If there is no proof, ideas is all we have. Shouldn't we share it then?	2016-02-06 09:36:13Z	Michał Šrajer

4611	Hi there, and welcome to health.SE! Unfortunately, this question seems a bit too broad. Are you looking for some type of specific issue that might be caused? You should ask the specific question if so.	2016-02-01 21:44:35Z	Dave Liu
4606	I found a lead in intensivedietarymanagement.com/fasting-myths-part-5 : In fact, look how quickly the merest touch of glucose reverses the hormonal changes of fasting. Only 7.5 grams of glucose (2 teaspoons of sugar or barely a sip of a soft drink) is enough to reverse the ketosis. Almost immediately after consuming glucose, the ketones beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate drop to almost nothing, as does fatty acids. Insulin rises, as does glucose.	2016-02-01 07:06:19Z	
4606	And why do you need to use those specific brands of vitamins and calcium? I'm extremely skeptical that there's anything special about any particular brand of multivitamin or calcium supplement.	2016-02-07 17:34:00Z	Carey Gregory

4592	Hi @anon and welcome to health.SE! Your current question seems to be more about the logistics of a procedure rather than health-oriented. Why do you think it's bad to undergo extraction before flying?	2016-01-31 20:59:37Z	Dave Liu
4592	The answer from a health perspective is "it depends." Is it a simple extraction or a more involved one that will require follow-up? For reasons like that I think this is asking for personal medical advice, which we can't provide. As for having it done in the US, I think that question would be a better fit for travel.SE. Therefore, I'm voting to close.	2016-02-10 23:03:00Z	Carey Gregory

4571	I doubt any rigorous studies have been done with slow juicers, but I could be wrong.  People have looked at cooked (boiled etc) fruits and juices, so would you be willing to accept an extrapolation from that?

4568	Have you been exposed to any chemicals that you know of recently? Has your drinking water been compromised? Is it affecting multiple people or just one in the same household, neighborhood, etc.? Have you talked with your doctor about this? Have you changed your diet or started consuming anything new?I assume you're not battling cancer, being exposed to chemo therapy or radiation but there are many environmental factors that can cause this type of side effect. Also, you're not disclosing your age or geographical region, etc. I think people will need MORE detail in your question actually.	2016-02-01 22:46:42Z	Facebook
4568	Thanks @1Fish_2Fish_RedFish_BlueFish (+1) - I'm not opposed to answering these, but (especially for the bounty) I am looking for the universe of things that might cause this, which shouldn't be too much given how specific the symptoms are. But in any event: (1) Not exposed to any chemicals, (2) I am the only in the household affected, (3) No doctor because, again, I'm not soliciting medical advice, I'm purely looking for a causal analysis here, (4) Diet hasn't changed, (5) Not battling cancer/chemo/radiation/etc., (6) I'm male early 30s caucasian, and (7) Upstate NY (Adirondacks)...	2016-02-02 01:19:23Z

4538	@anongoodnurse I don't actually think this question indicates a lack of research, but rather a brevity of language. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. That this question, before I upvoted it, was tied for the worst question score in Top Questions makes me thing worrying things about the site as a whole.	2016-01-29 19:43:52Z	Fomite
4538	@Fomite - As with the opinion of the question's quality, interpreting the absolute lack of evidence of research as brevity is subjective. This state of site as a whole is, in my opinion at least, something to be concerned about, and not only because of this particular question. Recent meta and waiting room discussions have been addressing this issue. The front page is awful. That concerns me.	2016-01-29 23:13:23Z	anongoodnurse

4525	In my opinion this question is a good and necessary question, but is very broad based. It depends on alot of variables. Depending on age, weight, doses, how strong the medicine reacts to certain organs of the body. I think it not a question that should be answered on this SE.	2016-01-27 08:38:16Z	Nachmen
4525	I think it's exactly the type of question that deserves good answers, and this site is a perfect forum for such answers.  The ideal answer will address the variables you mention if they are relevant.  A good, but not perfect, answer will provide more useful information than nothing at all, which is where we all stand now.	2016-01-27 10:16:05Z	
4525	If so when is a question to broad that it's put on hold or closed completely?	2016-01-27 13:06:42Z	Nachmen
4525	@Nachmen I think it is quite broad, and a good answer will therefore probably be long, but it is answerable, which is probably why there are no close votes.	2016-01-28 20:32:13Z	Carey Gregory
4525	The least I would say is that, in order to buffer the stomach, you should probably take slow sugars (not sure of the actual translation) which involves amidon, like pasta, potatoes, rice and so-on. They stay in your stomach, allowing for buffering effect; which is not the case for fruits or water, which directly go toward intestine.	2016-05-26 14:15:22Z	Blue_Elephant
4524	Hmm... I wonder if this question is more suited to biology.se?	2016-01-27 06:54:57Z	Dave Liu
4524	@DaveL Possibly.	2016-01-27 09:05:35Z	
4521	This is much too broad. There are countless problems one can elaborate on (headache? shoulder pain? stomach ache? flu? nosebleed? chest pain? fracture? snake bite? rash? minor aches and pains? major aches and pains? fever?) Are you asking about all of these and more? Literally, there are innumerable scenarios for which you're asking a blanket answer to cover. If you want an actual answer, you need to focus your question to something answerable.	2016-01-27 04:32:39Z	anongoodnurse
4521	It's intentionally broad. I see the question is up for being closed, but I don't think this is good for the site. Some questions about health are very broad because health is an extremely broad subject, as you pointed out. When you're not an expert, yet are faced with pressing needs, you would like to have a rule of thumb. I believe that it's unrealistic to have a health site that excludes discussions related to broad and imprecise rules of thumb. The subject of health is immense and health issues are serious, if not occasionally life-critical. As such, there's just no way around it.	2016-02-01 06:05:02Z	
4517	Can you provide a specific reference (including pg if book) so that it can be dealt with directly? I know of no scientific validity to the claim as you have written it.	2016-01-26 02:22:15Z	Atl LED
4517	The reference is the Edgar Cayce Readings, I can't send you a link because you have to be a member of the Association of Research and Enlightenment to access the readings, but you can Google the readings and use "dietary gold and Edgar Cayce " as a search term. Also, male sterility was predicted by Cayce to be caused by lack of gold in the body. This could be a testable prediction, do a study on men with sterility and measure the gold levels in the body and compare to a control group.	2016-01-26 07:39:07Z

4548	Putting vegetables in a blender isn't going to change their content, only their texture. So your question boils down to: Are carrots and spinach good for you? I don't know for sure but a guy named Popeye swears by them. ;-)	2016-02-19 01:59:42Z	Carey Gregory
4502	Although this paper doesn't look like outright rubbish (they had 76 test subjects which is not as bad as 15 or 20 like in some "studies"). This is not a big number, yet its far from ideal number of several thousand test subjects. IMHO the evolution cannot be that wrong. I personally believe (and I don't have evidence to it) that the breast milk wouldn't have enough iron only if a mother was anemic herself (and women are prone to anemy). I couldn't read the whole paper, but i would like to see the demography of the test subjects and their mothers: age, income etc. This factors could mean a lot.	2016-10-04 13:01:21Z	user2361
4500	Where you also outside and possibly more active than usual when you were getting the sunburn? How about warmer? Both of these easily raise your heart rate. Would you mind editing out " or other minor injury or illness" as that makes this overly broad.	2016-01-26 02:35:14Z	Atl LED
4500	@AtlLED - Maybe slightly more active than usual, but only for that one day.  Subsequent days were 'normal', and didn't cause the rate to drop back down.  And warmer, yes, it has been a fair bit warmer over the past week, particularly overnight and in the mornings.  Which is probably when I have the bulk of my 'at rest' time.	2016-01-26 04:13:47Z	
4500	After a bad burn (pale skin plus Australian summer) my resting hearting on a Fitbit went from 49 up to 53 and down again over the course of the week while the burn subsided. (Daily exercise levels remained consistent, you don’t get to 49 without it being so, hydration was good, sleep temps stable due to Aircon etc). Def seems to be that inflammation due to the burn seems to raise it a few points.	2018-01-28 22:23:15Z	Tom

4498	Were you also interested in the injury in the context of arthritis?  Because that can change the reasoning somewhat substantially, though there's still not going to be lateral diffusion.	2016-04-14 20:40:51Z	Atl LED

4497	I suspect that theory is untrue.  For one thing, vomiting won't remove the virus from your digestive tract; so if the virus is somehow turning food "toxic", any new food that you eat will also be made toxic (I suppose you could vomit and then not take in any new food, but that seems like a very bad idea).  For another, gastroenteritis has a number of causes, only some of which are viral.  Though will be interesting to see what someone with a medical background says.	2016-01-24 09:57:44Z	aroth

4460	I am so very sorry for your loss. I have one question and some advice. My question concerns your ancestry. Do you happen to have any Ashkenazi Jewish heritage? The advice is, you won't get an answer with anything even close to the precision you want on this site. It's a new site and there are no geneticists, perinatologists, or even obstretricians here. The doctors you've dealt with (if you've not consulted a geneticist, I'd advise you to do so if the heritage is there) are going to be your best advisers. Again, you have my sympathy.	2016-01-20 06:23:23Z	anongoodnurse
4460	My deepest sympathies as well. anongoodnurse is correct, anything we could provide would be a guess at best, and you deserve much more than that. Please, see some specialists that have experience in this area and can conduct the appropriate testings for you. Unfortunately, since this is would be a lot of guesswork on our part and very much personal medical advice, I will need to close this as an off topic question.	2016-01-20 14:52:42Z	JohnP
4460	I understand the attraction to statistics.  I ask about the numbers all the time, and I see the doctors clam up when I do.  Sadly the answer is often that good data doesn't exist or that it doesn't usefully describe the specific situation you have.  I don't presume to know your thought process here, but I would expect you'll find it easier to get numbers out of a doctor if you make it clear to them that you understand just how uninformative these numbers can be, and that they're not the sole basis of your decision.	2016-01-22 22:03:23Z	1--
4460	I am a physician and I agree with the comment directly above this one. It is not from fear of legal ramifications that your doctors are silent; it is because you're asking them to predict the future. No one can do that in your case.	2016-01-25 20:14:02Z	anongoodnurse
4456	Considering that Ebola, polio, and the common cold are all caused by viruses, you might want to narrow this down to a specific family of viruses.	2016-01-19 14:42:32Z	Carey Gregory
4456	This doesn't seem to be a question about Ebola, both the common cold as an example and mention of excess mucous show that. But though an interesting one the question came dangerously close to closing, so I took the liberty of specifying that it was about respiratory viral infections. If you disagree, please feel free to roll back to the original version.	2016-01-24 05:45:16Z	Lucky
4456	@Lucky respiratory viral infections is actually still far too broad in my opinion. If you wanted to limit to HRV, RSV, HMPV, HAV, hMV, flu, etc. just 1 of those could take a full SE awnser.	2016-01-26 02:40:49Z	Atl LED
4456	@AtlLED I've spent enough time around doctors to know that there are some general indicators of viral infection. Without any details about specific viruses, I'm really just trying to figure out which symptoms viral infections tend to cause, and which of those tend to be caused by the virus itself rather than the immune response to it. Information regarding a specific virus is useless in drawing conclusions, because there isn't enough data. I'd prefer broadly applicable to academically rigorous in this case. I'm not asking for a full and complete answer, so much as some general patterns.	2016-01-26 10:07:16Z	
4456	@Lucky I in no way think the question "What are the pathogenic effects of [insert virus] due to the virus and not the immune response" is a personal medical question. I do think "What are the pathogenic effects of all respiratory viruses due to the virus and not the immune response." is too broad and should be closed.  I can point to several book chapters on the subject.	2016-01-26 19:44:19Z	Atl LED

4451	@YviDe - Creases happen all over the body. Major and minor creases exist on every part of your skin. Look just above your palms at your wrists (dorsal or palmar surfaces.) Look at the antecubital fossae, or the popliteal fossae, and the axillae. These are but a very few of the major creases. The minor ones cover the enitre body. It's a common mistake to believe that because one doesn't know something, it does not exist. Palmar (and plantar) creases are only more obvious because of the smoothness/thickness of the surrounding skin.	2016-01-20 07:21:35Z	anongoodnurse
4449	"I think it's a cold, maybe something else, doesn't affect the question" Actually, I think the question should be reworded to only refer to the common cold. Making it about every possible illness is insanely broad, so it is unanswerable in the current state and should be closed by the site's rules. Asking how to minimize the symptoms of a started cold, on the other hand, is a good question.	2016-01-19 17:50:55Z	rumtscho
4449	@rumtscho I'll edit it. Thanks!	2016-01-20 00:45:56Z	
4449	Now that the question has been closed, I took the liberty of rewording it to the point where I think it can be opened again. I had two major problems with it before: First, it asked for "illness" in general, but as I said before, that's too broad to answer. Second, you were talking about "prevention" but clearly stated that you are asking about "after the symtpoms appear". At that point, you are already sick, and cannot prevent getting sick any more. I'm sorry I did such a major edit, but I think it was important in order to save the question. Voting for reopen.	2016-01-20 16:09:10Z	rumtscho

4432	@CountIblis I don't think making it blunt would make it much less dangerous. Especially big bones like the one in the 2015 study i linked (image of bone during operation).	2016-01-21 11:17:15Z	
4432	I agree, but then there is of course a gag reflex that would normally prevent one from swallowing bones that are too big. So, normally, the bones you can swallow are not going to be a problem; at least I would guess that half a billion years of fine tuning of the body plan via natural selection has led to a solution of the most obvious problems.	2016-01-21 16:51:08Z	Count Iblis
4426	The high energy that carbs provide is fattening enough. Maybe your friend is saying that carbs are fattening because they are high in calories? Or are you sure your friend is saying that carbs are especially fattening?	2016-01-17 02:07:54Z	busukxuan
4426	@busukxuan but carbs aren't particularly calorie dense, it is the carbs they are saying is fattening, as they say that an all meat diet is much better. meat is fat and protein so is higher in calories, but has no carbs and hence are better for losing weight (according to them). See edit for more (comment too long)	2016-01-17 02:33:50Z	
4426	Also, it is relatively easy to eat large amounts of calories from carbs - most people can eat 3000 to 6000 in cakes and sweets in a day if they try. Overeating on fat or protein calories is more difficult, you get 'full' and disinterested much quicker (try to eat a pound of chicken...). I have no references for that, so consider it 'anecdotal'.	2016-01-17 05:32:32Z	Aganju

4419	I think this can be reworded to be a neutral question, but the current formulation makes it a personal advice one. It should also probably be separated - when you ask both about sun and "pheromones" at once, it invites speculation of which one was the reason in your back story. Plus, you will have to specify what you mean by pheromones, as there are no obvious candidates in humans.	2016-01-18 12:08:23Z	rumtscho

Finally, "what if's" are better handled on sites like Biology (maybe).	2016-01-16 01:31:40Z	anongoodnurse
4412	Yes of course I meant without swallowing. Well I want to know if for example you can chew fries/nuggets/oreos/cake/pop/ect and just spit it out without any harm as if you've never ate them at all! The only possible way it wouldn't work is if my tongue has holes that eat the food (because then it'd be like swallowing it~).	2016-01-16 02:17:02Z	
4412	You're missing my point. If you want a good answer, put some effort into the question. If you already know the answer ("The only possible way it wouldn't work is if my tongue has holes that eat the food") then maybe  it's not a real question.	2016-01-16 02:21:09Z	anongoodnurse

4360	@Jorge Luque, that makes sense. I can imagine too much in either direction is not good. Considering the heel of your foot is somewhat pointy, whereas the front is flatter, perhaps it's better to lean forward slightly. I'm just wondering if there are any reputable sources about this.	2016-01-24 10:15:18Z	
4351	The "partially registered" effect sounds a little like Troxler's fading.  Saccades normally stop that happening, but maybe you're doing something that forces you to focus on a fixed point (first person shooters?).  How long does the effect last, and do you notice any other effects at around the same time?  Migraine aura are an obvious guess when you point at scotoma.  They don't have to come with pain.	2016-01-15 05:59:52Z	1--
4351	@1-- When working on a document I'll often stare at a particular spot while mentally composing what I'm typing, and it usually happens after I shift my sight from somewhere I have been looking at for a while, so that sounds about right! Thanks!	2016-01-31 21:27:39Z	
4351	I know your title asks for a term, but your question sure looks like a request for a diagnosis, which nobody on the internet can provide. If you really think you might have a problem, quit wasting time on the internet and see an eye doctor.	2016-12-12 05:01:17Z	Carey Gregory
4342	Can you please clarify what you mean by "acquire"? Do you mean that a person that had an infected tooth gets a kidney infection from the same bacteria that cause the tooth infection?	2016-01-10 21:37:25Z	YviDe
4342	@YviDe - yes, the chances of getting kidney infection from the same bacteria	2016-01-11 16:26:17Z	
4342	Sorry just a little more clarification.  Do you mean the person with the tooth infection some how spreads to themselves the same infection in their kidneys?  Or to another person?  A person with a bacterial tooth (or any oral) infection could give a woman receiving unprotected oral sex a kidney infection. That's the most likely scenario I can think of for this.	2016-01-15 03:50:35Z	Atl LED
4342	I was referring to a tooth infection affecting kidneys of the same person. Thanks.	2016-01-16 04:40:14Z

4340	Are we talking about in an otherwise healthy adult?  Peds can actually be faster, but geriatric (where I have little experience and this is more commonly done) tend to recover slower.	2016-01-15 03:54:55Z	Atl LED
4340	@AtlLED Yes, otherwise healthy adult. Let's say ~30 year-old male.	2016-01-15 04:05:23Z

4337	Your GF appears to have had a serious case of pyelonephritis. The risk of a recurrence for her is what you should be principally worried about, since she only has one kidney left. This is a serious matter which, if the two of you are in a serious relationship, should be discussed with her urologist/nephrologist/whatever specialist is watching over her remaining precious kidney. If you're asking do people who are intimate pick up each other's colonic bacteria, the answer is "yes".	2016-01-10 08:07:00Z	anongoodnurse

4359	I'm not sure what the biology is (could be related to dehydration that coffee causes), but people who use voice more or less professionally (singing or lecturing) don't drink coffee for a few days if they loose voice.	2016-01-10 13:11:00Z	
4359	It's not likely to have much effect 1 way or the other. Before I post my answer, would you say but you have been drinking coffee regularly for many years? It's mostly going to come down to the caffeine	2016-01-13 01:26:25Z	Atl LED

4336	"Cognitive function", is very jaded and a great example of overly broad terminology. Contrary to the rest, I can assure you that 'Choline' does support cognitive function or more formally, neural function, being that Choline is a precursor to the Neurotransmitter, Acetylcholine.

4335	I dug around for a case study, and didn't find one, but that doesn't mean no one ever tried. I'm also struggling to understand the situation where you have the means to ignite the gunpowder, but couldn't also use that same means to cauterize the wound. Using a tourniquet should almost always be preferable to cauterizing	2016-01-13 02:27:10Z	Atl LED
4335	@AtlLED I'm thinking that a tourniquet wouldn't be preferable in this case due to the location of the wound...	2017-06-21 18:59:22Z	L.B.
4335	@L.B. Which case?  The one from "Dual Survival?"  I absolutely agree that neither a tourniquet nor cauterization is called for there.	2017-06-21 19:02:29Z	Atl LED
4335	@AtlLED From what I read there, I agree with that. But I was discussing the wound mentioned in the question.	2017-06-21 19:10:23Z	L.B.
4335	@L.B. Yeah, one generally doesn't tourniquet the neck :p  That doesn't mean you should hit the black powder. I was thinking this question didn't ask for the proper field trauma response to a neck wound, but if you think it's needed, maybe we could link it as a separate question.	2017-06-21 19:20:30Z	Atl LED
4328	You can even skip brushing your teeth altogether and never have to problem... I assume you are asking for probabilities and not about whether it's possible at all?	2016-01-09 09:52:30Z	YviDe
4328	Correct, probabilities. I'm sure a few outliers could get away with never brushing their teeth, but I think most people would face at least some degree of tooth decay. I'm trying to get a sense of how important fluoride treatment (and specifically, topical fluoride in the form of toothpaste) is to oral health. Is it a might-as-well ingredient that acts as just one of many lines of defense against tooth decay? Is fluoride use more important than any other dental care practice? Or, is it somewhere in between?	2016-01-11 01:38:50Z

4324	I doubt this question can be answered since exhaust gas can vary a lot based on many factors (e.g. environment temperature affects diesel emissions, different countries have varying regulations about emissions and different vehicle quality, etc).	2016-01-11 18:10:26Z	Fermi paradox
4320	Voted to close as too broad. Almost every food which contains any amount of protein contains some BCAA, you'd be hard pressed to find exceptions. Lactovegetarian diets typically supply sufficient protein, so an answer would have to list some (or all) of the foods you can typically eat, which is nonsensical. If you experience no symptoms of protein deficiency, you have no deficiency of BCAA either.	2016-01-08 11:51:47Z	rumtscho
4320	I was told I need to be including BCAAs first thing in the morning before working out etc.	2016-01-08 11:54:42Z	
4320	Then you'd have to eat breakfast first thing in the morning. It would really be hard to find a breakfast which doesn't have BCAA, maybe something highly processed. Pure fruit or veggies will also have very little, just because they are mostly water, and have a really low proportion of protein.	2016-01-08 11:55:52Z	rumtscho
4320	Retracted close vote and wrote an answer instead, using broad food groups instead of listing foods which might be a source.	2016-01-08 12:20:52Z	rumtscho
4320	@AlexS - WHY were you told BCAA's had to be consumed in the AM before working out? And by who? I'll take a look, but I'm not aware of any current studies that show it's more effective for a workout. The smell test says "bro-science by marketing to sell more stuff".	2016-01-08 16:41:56Z	JohnP
4319	Welcome to health SE. I think the question might be suitable for either this site or perhaps Academia SE. I've removed the medication tag, because we cannot recommend any medication, since that would constitute personal medical advice, which is strictly off topic here (there are detailed explanations on meta about this).	2016-01-08 11:32:23Z	Lucky
4311	Hello foobarbinbaz, and welcome! We cannot provide personal advice about what amount of medicine is the best for somebody's case, that's something only your doctor can do. I suspect somebody downvoted you because they thought that's what you're asking about. We can, however, help you understand the meaning of a medicine's leaflet. I edited your question to make it more clear that it is the second case you are asking about.	2016-01-07 13:56:20Z	rumtscho
4311	@rumtscho that's exactly what I meant. I need help deciphering the leaflet. When they say 20 mg per kg of body weight, do they mean 20 mg of the gel or just its active ingredient?	2016-01-07 20:36:03Z	
4311	I sadly don't know the answer, but the question got several upvotes after my edit, so it has a good chance now that somebody will answer. We are still rather small, so answers can take a while. But thank you for coming back and confirming that the edit was OK - here, everybody can edit a post, but edits which misrepresent the original author's intent are seen as invalid and reversed.	2016-01-07 20:39:17Z	rumtscho
4300	"It should also be quite easy to study" - that strikes me as highly unlikely. Breast firmness certainly changes with age, and bra wearing attitudes change with cultural trends, so will correlate somewhat with birth years. Bra types also changed a lot over the past decades. You need longitudinal data for very long periods of time, with age matched controls (expensive, high loss of subjects), a standardized measure of "firmness" which must have stayed unchanged for decades, and a sureness that subjects don't deviate from their condition over a lifetime. The topic is not a high (cont.)	2016-01-07 14:09:03Z	rumtscho
4300	(cont.) priority in public health either, so unlikely to have been run as public research, while privately funded research of this timescale is very unusual, and probably biased. So, while I am not certain that no good study exist about the subject, I'd say it's a very difficult subject to study, not an easy one as you claim.	2016-01-07 14:10:54Z	rumtscho

4295	Not my downvote, but the answer depends on what else you're eating, what shopping/storage habits you have, what's available in your area, and what time of year it is.  Also, the trendy answers vary continuously as different producers find excuses to brand their own produce as superfoods, so it's hard to give a useful answer.  On the other hand, banana is a popular staple in this situation.	2016-01-05 23:12:21Z	1--

4237	1.  I dunno.  Have you tried it?  Does it work for you?  ❧  2.  Why not instead use SleepBot on a smartphone or tablet, plus its "smart alarm" feature?  SleepBot is freeware.  (Tip:  It's safer not to recharge any device while you're asleep.  If you turn motion tracking off but smart alarms on, SleepBot won't power up your device's accelerometer until the early morning, which saves energy.)	2016-05-17 16:29:11Z	unforgettableid

4237	@JohnP: 2. SleepBot might be a good solution for the OP; or it might not. For example, s/he might not own a smartphone or tablet.  If s/he doesn't, I can suggest options.  (The iPhone 4 includes security holes which Apple will never patch, but the iPhone 4s is upgradable to the latest iOS and is available used for less than 150 USD.  Or perhaps the OP can buy dedicated waking-up hardware, such as a clock radio or clock radio with CD player. Such hardware might be able to provide very-gradually-increasing alarms, like SleepBot can, and/or very-gradually-increasing light.)	2016-06-03 17:36:03Z	unforgettableid

4221	Please please please don't delay vaccinations or follow the suggestions of quacks like Sears. Vaccination schedules are based on a deep understanding of the developing immune system and decades' worth of experience. As a parent myself, I completely sympathize with wanting the best for your children, but you should trust the overwhelming majority of pediatricians who say that the recommended schedule really is best.	2015-12-29 01:05:27Z	MattDMo
4221	@MattDMo I subscribe to "trust, but verify."  In my search for information regarding alternatives to child immunizations, I have seen great resistance to any attempt of verification, leaving me with less ability to trust.  Trust in an entity which profoundly opposes verification is more associated with cults than proper scientific inquiry.	2015-12-29 05:29:39Z	
4221	@CortAmmon what "side" do you mean? I have seen no attempt to scientifically explain why a delayed schedule is preferable by those people recommending it other than "we feel the recommended schedule is too much for the children"	2015-12-29 08:27:10Z	YviDe
4221	@CortAmmon I wrote my comment because I didn't have time last night for a proper answer.

4207	Hi Doc17, it seems that you asked several things, but the grammar made it a bit difficult to understand exactly what you wanted to know. "Why was it called 'earwig'" is off topic here, we can't tell you how language originated.

4127	@user19679 I have not. I've never had such an issue after many decades on this planet.  But I'm not educated about dyslexia at all... all it's forms and whether or not it can start later in life.	2015-12-21 05:10:01Z	
4127	A better tag would probably be "Neurology". It has something to do with the brain :-)	2015-12-21 05:35:16Z	YviDe
4127	Yea.  A downvote without any explanation.  Great way to help on a health site.	2015-12-22 06:39:58Z	
4127	If it helps, I sometimes do the same. Usually when I am tired or distracted, but it has happened when I was awake and concentrating, too. Would be cool to see if anyone had studied the phenomenon.	2015-12-24 22:37:47Z	YviDe
4126	In general, any medical procedure that is not prescribed and performed by a health care professional has to be regarded as unsafe. Basically, in medicine everything is assumed to be unsafe until it is proven to be safe. You can consider what the potential problems with this procedure would be that would likely be looked at first before it could ever become accepted practice. E.g. you can consider what would happen if lime juice accidentally enters your lungs, you could look into the risk of aspiration pneumonia.	2015-12-19 16:14:56Z	Count Iblis
4126	@Countiblis Please submit the above, as an answer ;) (include something about nasal bleeding too - blood vessels rupture due to drying + irritation in the dermis)	2015-12-20 04:02:30Z	user19679
4125	Did you read the studies linked in those answers? Or did you not find that information there?	2015-12-19 07:22:55Z	YviDe
4125	I think the term is just misleading. Air pollution might very well reduce life qualities, but if you consider everybody who died from the reduction of life qualities to have "died prematurely", no matter how vague this estimation is (i.e. considering every other factor to be equal, do they die three months earlier? Then more likely they'll actually die 10 years "earlier" already from another disease, say cancer), then this is not very helpful. Also, then you might as well consider almost everything in life to be "causing premature deaths" as well.	2015-12-24 05:40:36Z	JI Xiang
4125	@XiangJi there are actually very complex statistical methods going on in studies like these, it's not as easy as you seem to think, noone is saying "oh, they died a few months earlier than expected, so their death is attributed to air pollution". I don't know enough about these methods yet to write up an answer that a layperson can understand, though. who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/… has a section on it	2016-01-03 17:33:37Z	YviDe

4083	Hello and welcome to the site! We talked a bit in chat earlier :-) I am going to edit the question a bit to make it more general - if I horribly butcher what you wanted to say in the process, please do rollback my edit.	2015-12-16 10:13:33Z	YviDe
4083	@YviDe Thanks for taking the time to go through and edit that; definitely an improvement!	2015-12-16 12:19:56Z

4079	I was a bit confused by your question, especially the title in relation to the body. I edited it -  can you take a look and see whether this is what you are asking and maybe take another look at the title?	2015-12-16 10:48:56Z	YviDe
4079	Essentially I was asking if Phosphate levels affect testosterone levels or visa versa. I'm too sure how to word it, in all honesty. On that note, should I delete it?	2015-12-16 14:19:32Z	
4079	I don't think we're at a point where deletion is called for. It just needs some explanation what the connection between "is there a synergistic effect between tostesterone and phosphate" and "should the parathyroid gland be tested" is. I'm just a bit confused :-)	2015-12-16 14:31:25Z	YviDe
4079	Ah, I see. The parathyroid gland helps to maintain the Phosphate levels, and I was wondering if Phosphate and Testosterone "work together" so much so, that if there a lack of Phosphate would that be correlated with a lower testosterone level and visa versa	2015-12-16 14:41:23Z

4057	Hello Matas, the question in the title is not really answerable, as it is too broad. It would need to define what is a "healthy lifestyle", confirming that a person has followed it throughout their whole life, etc.. The "twin studies" one in the body is answerable and interesting, but it is not equivalent to the one in the title. My suggestion is to edit the whole question to be about genetic vs. nongenetic contribution to lifespan, else I would VTC as too broad.	2015-12-15 16:13:25Z	rumtscho
4057	@rumtscho done.	2015-12-15 16:22:37Z	
4057	@rumtscho - As I read it, the question isn't about the genetics/lifestyle, but "I need studies on twins that compare lifestyle to genetics". Looking for the research, rather than the outcome.	2015-12-15 17:46:17Z	JohnP
4044	Consider: why we brush our teeth and the salivary rate whilst resting/sleeping. Also, how we typically breathe during sleep (mouth) :)	2015-12-20 04:28:55Z	user19679

4044	How do you know? ;)	2015-12-20 04:30:51Z	user19679
4044	@user19679 apart from the fact that some of us do know (for example by having someone else awake in the room while we sleep), I wonder what your question is getting at?	2015-12-20 08:17:01Z	YviDe
4042	Hrm. I think this is a great question, but in the current form it might be too broad. Also, can you clarify what you mean by anaerobic exercise? I want to make sure you're not confusing high intensity with anaerobic.	2015-12-17 18:24:09Z	JohnP
4042	The question for any other items makes this too broad, in my opinion. But so far noone agrees with me ;-)	2015-12-18 09:11:05Z	YviDe
4042	Greg, is it okay that my answer didn't address regimens that combine meditation and exercise? Separate daily plans seem compatible in almost all situations.	2015-12-24 13:58:43Z	HDE 226868
4042	@hde-226868: thanks for the answer. I selected it as correct, did you get the bounty?	2016-01-02 21:54:21Z	
4042	@GregMcNulty Half of it was auto-awarded. Thanks for the accept; I hope the answer was good enough.	2016-01-02 21:56:19Z	HDE 226868

4028	What makes you think food can be enough to regulate thyroid function?	2015-12-11 07:17:36Z	YviDe
4028	This question needs to be more specific before it can be reasonably answered. It should either ask about hypo, or hyper, but not both, or alternatively ask about which foods are appropriate no matter which condition one has.	2015-12-11 08:46:31Z	Highly Irregular
4028	@Highly Irregular Why wouldn't you ask for both? Wouldn't it be logical to assume that hyper & hypo are dependently correlated relative to consumption of a food? For example, if you know that a food lowers your blood pressure, then you would want to consume it when you have high blood pressure.	2015-12-14 03:50:21Z	
4028	@HighlyIrregular "which foods are appropriate no matter which condition one has..." I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure that category includes basically anything that humans consider food. Look, I understand that asking for hypo/hyper may encompass a reasonably sizable zone, but given that I'm asking specifically benefits from diet, I don't imagine volumes written on this answer, and based on the assumption(may or may not be accurate) that hypo/hyper operate dependently relative to same food, then I believe this question is fair. To discuss further, let's chat privately.	2015-12-14 04:06:42Z	
4028	@DaveL My original problem wasn't with the scope, but seeing that edit, I have retracted my vote. Hyperthyroidism and hyperthyroidism both can have various causes, though, and hypothyroidism is not just a reverse of hyperthyroidism, so I don't think your assumption that food that helps in one situation should be avoided in the other follows, but a possible answer can tackle that	2015-12-14 11:36:58Z	YviDe
4026	Haha, I like the wording "is there scientific evidence either way?". Probably yes, on that type of question the problem is usually not that we don't have enough evidence, it is that we have lots of contradictory and inconclusive evidence.	2015-12-10 19:37:22Z	rumtscho

4025	Hello, and welcome to the site! Unfortunately your question in its current form is off topic, as it is asking for a personal medical assessment. I would encourage you to visit the help section, and if you can reword your question to be less personal, it can be nominated for reopening.	2015-12-11 04:49:51Z	JohnP

4025	I appreciate the edit, however I still believe that this is not really an answerable question, as it's either going to be very broad to address all causes of chronic nasal congestion, or people just speculating. I won't decline the reopen nomination, however, so if 5 other users believe it has merit it will be automatically reopened.	2015-12-11 19:08:17Z	JohnP
4025	@JohnP I had a hunch that perhaps this is a cause of a nutritional deficiency as multiple more-delicate body-parts such as lips and nostrils are undergoing symptoms, rather than just the nose which is a very common condition. It is still pretty broad but I am still curious in this set of conditions, as to what their possible causes may be. I hope that users see this as worth answering.

4002	Neither. Use plain soap and water.	2017-05-19 20:34:23Z	Carey Gregory
4000	Proving a negative (that something has no effect) is pretty hard, especially something like this where I doubt any scientific studies have been done. Besides, "boosting the immune system" is something that gets said a lot, but has no meaningful definition. Can you think of anything you would accept as proof that this association does not exist?	2015-12-12 07:40:37Z	YviDe
4000	He stated "lots of people know this", implying that studies had been done and were known to a larger community. I believe in seeking independent verification, when practical, for what I believe AND disbelieve. I was fairly certain that what he said was BS, but sought out an objective opinion. I agree with you that a lack of evidence is not in itself evidence that there isn't any evidence. If his claim could have been substantiated in any way I would have lent it more credibility. Thank you for your reply.	2016-04-01 13:36:43Z

3991	I would imagine it is somewhat dependent on the weather and how close you are standing to them.	2016-08-10 13:25:59Z	L.B.
3991	Even if you avoid direct exposure to their smoke (that should minimize most of the risk linked to inhalation), there is a greater risk that you are exposed to: peer pressure. Over a long period of time you could feel compelled to start start smoking.	2016-11-03 15:40:38Z	beppe9000
3991	To calculate the risk you would need to know the concentration of each substance in the air that you are breathing - I don't know if there is an estimation of concentrations of cigarette smoke pollutants if you are standing next to a smoker outdoors, per cigarette. If there is such an estimation one would use a formula like this: rais.ornl.gov/tools/rais_chemical_risk_guide.html (section 4.12.2.2) but would adjust the no of days according to yours and turn 8h/day into say 0.5h/day in the numerator. If you can dig up some research on the concentrations, I can give the calculation a try	2017-01-23 21:11:42Z	Lucky

3987	Thanks @anongoodnurse (+1) - yes the best information I was able to find relating to mastocytoma in kids was from MastoKids.org, however, they don't seem to address the one questio I'm posing here (the relationship/correlation between the two).	2015-12-07 17:33:40Z	
3989	I understand your concerns, Manny, but trust me, Internet is definitely the worst place to seek medical advice. Consult a dermatologist or oncologist, as they are the only people capable of giving educated advice. Also, I'm voting to close this question as asking for medical advice is forbidden on this site. Try this question: parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/626/…	2015-12-07 10:06:35Z	
3989	I'll ask Health if they're interested in it, and migrate if so. I'll note, though, that you can always ask a dermatologist or different pediatrician for a second opinion and/or for more detail about "when to be concerned" -- when Dariusz and Rory closed your question, it was not eliminating your ability to get clear, professional answers.	2015-12-07 13:26:16Z

3942	Why would you restrict dairy intake to restrict carbohydrates? 100g of milk only has 5g.	2015-12-04 05:47:41Z	YviDe
3942	@YviDe That is only the 'direct' carbohydrates. Many more emerge while the lactose is being metabolized. See pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-1975-0015.ch006	2015-12-04 07:39:17Z	
3942	And as lactose is a disaccharide sugar, it can't be somehow digested to form more carbohydrates while digested, which your comment kind of soudned like you were implying. It's split into glucose and galactose, sure, but there's no "emergence" of sugars going on, that's just a disaccharide being split into two monoaccharides	2015-12-04 08:46:01Z	YviDe
3942	The fact that you asked this, just shows that your common sense is worried about what you are doing. Applying your special diet sounds selfish and could be dangerous in long term. If your child doesn't suffer any illness, which makes a special diet necessary, you should not enforce a special diet.Treat your kid normal, until a qualified person (a doctor) or obvious circumstances told you something other.	2015-12-04 16:20:34Z	Peter
3940	There is no danger of paramedics mistaking hypoglycemia for something else. Checking blood sugar is one of the first things they'll do for someone found unconscious for unknown reasons who is breathing and has a pulse. However, the information is still vital for them and the hospital to have because it answers the question of why your blood sugar is so low.	2017-02-09 16:46:45Z	Carey Gregory

3902	Hi! This is an interesting question. I think there's a really good  general question in here, so I am going to edit the question a bit to remove some of your details (personal medical questions are off-topic here).

I mean, I'll confess, I think this question is imminent on health.SE, but I request that you don't down-vote because of content. Down-vote because the question is too broad or opinion based or runs against health.SE's standards. We're better than down-voting just because a question sounds immature.	2015-11-30 21:16:38Z	
3892	I agree. There's nothing silly or immature about the question.	2016-10-28 18:38:54Z	Carey Gregory
3891	It really depends on the spoilage.  Could be anything from botulism to vomiting.  Should I answer, or is the question too broad?	2017-04-26 01:23:28Z	can-ned_food
3891	@can-ned_food It seems too broad to me, but if you think you can master a good answer go for it.	2017-04-26 12:38:52Z	Lucky
3891	DaveL:  A)  Why do you ask?  B)  Why meat and milk specifically?  C)  Do you only want to know what's the severest that can happen?  Or do you want to know both the lightest and severest?	2017-04-26 16:25:08Z	tealhill
3882	Hi there @Noah and welcome to health.SE! Sorry to hear about your condition, but this site isn't for diagnosis. I've reworded the question so that you might be able to get help, but otherwise, I think the way your question was previously worded might have been closed. If you feel that this doesn't help you, I would suggest rolling-back my edits and then rewording a little to ask something like, "What are some possible causes of  seizures when sick?", but again, this might be too broad. Still, I'd say you should give it a shot if that's what you want to ask. Again, welcome.	2015-11-29 21:59:33Z	Dave Liu

3872	How's she doing now?  Her symptoms seem contraindicative of a cow's–milk allergy, the symptoms of which are much like most other histamine attacks:  hives, flushing and redness, swelling, respiratory problems.  I hope you got some useful information during the 18 months since you asked.	2017-04-26 01:39:05Z	can-ned_food
3872	Thanks for asking! You're right in that it never seemed like a full-blown allergy, just sensitivity. She's doing a lot better now. She can handle cheese, baked goods with milk, ice cream. Pretty much everything except a straight-up glass of milk. That's more due to us still taking it slow than anything - in the past there has seemed to be some correlation between having dairy and getting a stuffy nose. Every time we think about trying milk she gets the sniffles so we hold off. But she has handled everything else just fine. Never did figure out how it felt to her tho!	2017-04-26 02:08:07Z	
3870	So far, I looked into the Guidelines for the Treatment of Hypothyroidism online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/thy.2014.0028 but that doesn't seem to include recommendations like what I am looking for	2015-11-30 21:32:34Z	
3851	Welcome to Healt.SE! Its's doubtful you'll get an answer "today" (which taking timezones into account might already be past), so I recommend you talk to your doctor. However, this is an interesting general question!	2015-11-26 07:20:37Z	YviDe
3851	@YviDe Indeed, it does have value to future readers. My daughter actually got a stomach bug at the same time I got a cold, so I didn't take her to get a flu shot.	2015-11-30 17:06:32Z	
3842	This question is vague - it really depends on the type of "sutures" you're talking about. Sounds like you're talking about skin sutures - but there are a lot of other places we (surgeons) put sutures.	2015-11-25 14:40:05Z	Vance L Albaugh
3837	From mentioning mumps, rubella, and chickenpox, I am assuming you are also talking about vaccinations?	2015-11-24 10:01:27Z	YviDe
3837	sure. by "letting your kids get sicknesses" i meant not vaccinating them against them.	2015-11-24 10:12:45Z	
3837	Amazonian tribes could be used as a point of reference? This would focus more on virus', however.	2015-11-24 10:25:38Z	user19679
3837	As it is, I think this question is too broad to be answered: how is a "weaker" or "stronger" immune system defined? All infections, ever? What about autoimmune diseases? What about the risks of getting the vaccine-preventable diseases, should that be factored in?	2015-11-24 11:07:12Z	YviDe
3837	@YviDe I'd define weaker and stronger as less or more reslilence against new sicknesses. Like do you get sick every time some cold spreads around, or are you one of those people who never gets sick.	2015-11-24 11:15:07Z	
3835	I'm in two minds about this question... While it clearly is about worldbuilding, it would still be better suited for Health.SO	2015-11-24 08:04:19Z	
3822	Are you sure he was commenting on the anesthesia, or maybe he was just commenting on the number of surgeries you've undergone? Regardless, this is an interesting question. I hope we get some answers soon.	2015-11-24 04:57:11Z	Dave Liu
3822	There are people out there who have had general anesthesia dozens and dozens of times so three times is not a lot by any measure. (I've had more than that.) I think @DaveL is right that he was commenting on the number of surgeries, not the anesthesia.	2016-10-18 18:46:02Z	Carey Gregory
3822	I'm fine and I have been under over 4 dozen times in the last few years.	2017-04-04 02:44:32Z	user8785
3821	Try checking out worldbuilding.stackexchange.com It's a great site for works of fiction that require some scientific knowledge.	2015-11-24 01:06:17Z	Celeritas
3821	@Sophie I edited the question to make it more general and applicable to general first-aid measures so that it's a practical first-aid question. I think that might raise the probability of your post getting an answer. Feel free to roll back if you think otherwise.	2015-11-24 08:18:19Z	Dave Liu
3821	@Celeritas Unfortunately this isn't really a very good question for us at Worldbuilding. Consider the scope of Worldbuilding SE.	2015-11-24 08:54:12Z	Michael Kjörling
3821	@MichaelKjörling are you aware that DaveL edited to remove the part that this is for a work of fiction?	2015-11-24 08:56:02Z	Celeritas
3821	@Celeritas I didn't check the revision history and see that that difference was due to DaveL's edit, but just because a question is asked as research for a work of fiction does not automatically make it on topic on Worldbuilding.	2015-11-24 09:23:24Z	Michael Kjörling
3817	Hello and welcome to Health.SE! I edited your question a bit so it's easier to read. If you disagree with any of that, feel free to edit again. Also, I removed the last part - this site is for answers based in science.	2015-11-23 17:37:32Z	YviDe
3817	I have a further question which I think would make it a better question for this site - as it is, the question is a bit vague, could you say what exactly you heard? That it's bad for digestion, or something else? Maybe you can add a source where this is claimed.	2015-11-23 17:39:57Z	YviDe
3817	@YviDe : I added a bit of context based on your suggestion in the comments. Hope it looks fine now.	2015-11-25 17:11:41Z	
3816	Hi there, and welcome to health.SE! We like to have clearly asked questions here, maybe with a bit more information like background of the question too. For example, maybe you're preparing a punch bowl for a dinner, and want to add dry ice to it or perhaps you're just curious about swallowing a cube of dry ice (bad idea). I've edited it to say what I think you meant to ask. Feel free to roll back any changes or make some more. I'll try to answer this by today.	2015-11-23 20:16:06Z	Dave Liu
3816	I want to get answer because we having restaurant I want to put in to menu	2015-11-24 07:06:31Z

3802	I very much doubt that anyone has studied causes of death in programmers specifically. You might want to edit your question to just ask about sedentary desk jobs.	2017-11-10 23:53:39Z	Carey Gregory
3797	Hmm I wonder if this belongs to linguistics.se or something? It's mainly about the language rather than health, but I wouldn't mind keeping a question like this on health.se, since it certainly does pertain to health.	2018-02-18 04:38:01Z	Dave Liu
3787	Probably not. If so, I'm sure it would be easy to find them because of the number of people obsessed with longevity. Typically adult humans will have the same hormones as they were when children, but maybe at a lower intensity since they're past the growth stage. Unless perhaps castration happens. Ouch.	2015-11-22 22:19:28Z	Dave Liu
3792	What do you mean with "major role"? Globally? Or for the individual?	2015-11-20 17:56:50Z	YviDe
3792	I don't understand the question. The study abstract makes it quite clear that it is a novel finding that there is a connection at all. The study is a few days old. If anybody in the world has more knowledge than there is in this study, it is not published yet. So, how do you expect anybody to tell you more than there is in the source you already found yourself? The question you are asking, "significant increase in fertility in humans" is so overly broad, it will take decades of such studies before anyone in the world can give an estimation.	2015-11-20 19:41:55Z	rumtscho
3792	@rumtscho has a good point, which is a shame because this is a fascinating finding that probably has implications in several arenas, not the least of which is whether the changes the worms induce might confer some sort of reproductive advantage for the worms. Sadly, I probably won't live long enough to find out unless an animal model can be found.	2015-11-21 02:25:54Z	Carey Gregory
3792	@Rumtscho-Your comment would be more apt if it is converted to an answe r!	2015-11-21 06:13:57Z	
3784	Non-compliant with what?	2015-11-20 13:42:40Z	Carey Gregory
3784	I don't know about just as effective(which is why this is a comment and not an answer), but have you tried azelaic acid? It's traditionally used for rosacea but also can work as a treatment for acne rosacea, which can appear very similar to acne vulgaris.  If you actually have acne rosacea and not acne vulgaris, it may work for you.  It's a prescription drug(brand name Finacea or Skinoren) but is less expensive than accutane in the short-term so your insurance might help pay for it.  Since it is OTC in other countries, you may be able to purchase it from abroad(at least if you are in the USA).	2015-11-21 00:14:10Z	user10800
3784	Non-compliant with taking the minocycline, my doctor now gave  me cefadroxil, clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide "You mix the clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide", and then at night i put on tretonoin	2015-11-21 00:18:57Z	
3784	@DavidMorales "effectiveness" is hard to measure and begins to sound like a request for personal diagnosis. If you could reword your question to ask for something specific, then maybe we'd be able to help.	2015-11-24 03:42:53Z	Dave Liu
3784	Yeah sorry David, the medicine they perscibed works great, any chance that i could have built up a resistance up before and now its gone?	2015-11-25 14:27:44Z	
3777	@CareyGregory, YviDe - please don't answer in comments. Clarification is fine (e.g. "What do you mean by 'weaker'?") but an answer is not. Thanks.	2015-11-21 07:41:55Z	anongoodnurse
3777	Please see meta question about comments with downvotes. You're not likely to get one, even if you ask.	2015-11-21 07:44:13Z	anongoodnurse
3777	@anongoodnurse I don't think that question is related to me. See my comment there. Also, I think that the meta post explains why answer in comment is prohibited should be link	2015-11-21 10:01:45Z	
3777	My guess is that "Based on the alarmed of many resources, superbugs are stronger than their wild type. Do you know why superbugs aren't weaker than their wild type?" You have provided no sources for this difficult claim. Naming your (re)sources (excluding the Oxford dictionary, which is an excellent source on English Language and usage) with a pertinent summary usually makes for a much better question.	2015-11-21 10:15:03Z	anongoodnurse
3777	@anongoodnurse I read them on newspapers in my native language. They are credible sources in my country (like The NY Times), but what they written in are just short interviews with doctors. Being said, I think this is widely accepted knowledge. Do you think that I really need to have an English resource? Also, why the dictionary shouldn't be a resource for definitions?	2015-11-21 10:34:25Z	
3773	Are you referring to Osteoporosis? If so, yes - it is a risk factor. We cannot demonstrate this as, an experiment would be unethical.	2015-11-18 20:13:58Z	user19679
3773	Are you referring solely to the bones in the paralyzed area? Or the bone structure in general?	2015-11-18 22:10:24Z	JohnP
3773	I guess it would be both. If there was some sort of development where a device was made in place of the muscles and suddenly the patient would be able to walk by the means of this device, would the bones be strong enough to support them? (suppose the device adds no more weight than an average student's backpack would)	2015-11-19 19:56:54Z	
3771	The point is that this question covers numerous cases. Is the victim conscious, or not conscious? Do you see one wound or two wounds at opposite sides of the trunk? Does the victim bleed by the mouth or the anus? And many other points. I'll try to answer as soon as possible though.	2015-11-22 19:54:15Z	Shlublu
3771	@Shlublu What I meant was general first aid procedure, including checking for exit wounds, consciousness, and oral/anal bleeding, altering the treatment in response to these, but i understand that this might be too complex an injury to compile a procedure for.	2015-11-29 14:19:03Z	
3768	Very interesting question that leads onto other questions that I'd like to ask.	2015-11-22 23:44:32Z	Dave Liu

3757	Sounds like the common nightmare, to me..? Just like the "falling" sensation/nightmare that most of us experience at some point - we wake up and still feel as if we are falling. So, we grab onto something until the sense of derealisation passes.	2015-11-17 16:55:07Z	user19679
3757	R.Doto.  My understanding from talking with this person is that it is different or a lot more than what you suggest.  I personally have suffered from "exploding head syndrome" or whatever it is called.  This is a weird and benign disorder where you wake up in the middle of the night hearing a heart-stopping like bomb noise.  And, that's not just a nightmare thing.  This person experiences a similar thing, but instead of hearing a bomb, she feels like she is in the midst of a 7.0 earthquake.	2015-11-17 17:08:30Z	
3757	Oh ok. I misunderstood. Well first and foremost, you should ask if the patient is experiencing any aural "issues". Doing this you can reduce the possible causes substantially. However, Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the first thing that comes to mind, for now.	2015-11-17 21:46:53Z	user19679
3757	Also, does the patient live in an area of frequent tectonic activity?	2015-11-17 21:51:11Z	user19679
3754	Optometrists may be able to help, but I think you might mean "opthalmologist". Optometrists are the good folks who make eyeglasses. Opthalmologists deal with issuea which mat result in recurrent chalazions.	2015-11-16 23:55:43Z	anongoodnurse
3754	I've had those damn things but never had one drain so I don't know the answer, but if I had infectious material draining into my eye I would want some antibiotic coverage.	2015-11-19 06:31:04Z	Carey Gregory
3754	Thanks - that was my exact line of thought, but I decided to monitor the eye closely and so far it has been doing very well. I have a small 'scab' on the eyelid but every day the eye is less swollen.	2015-11-20 14:16:48Z	
3754	Hi there, this seems like it's asking for personal diagnosis, but is dancing on the line of general treatment for Chalazion. Could you please add a definition for chalazion and then reword the question to reflect a more general question? Then we may be able to address it.	2016-02-13 00:43:57Z	Dave Liu
3747	On a more serious note, how easily are you awakened while sleep walking? (Alarms, arm squeeze, etc.)	2015-11-16 21:31:42Z	TTT
3747	I'm awoken if someone speaks to me, but grabbing me isn't a good idea. Also, I'm quite a big lad, so being fastened to the bed would just mean it came with me.	2015-11-18 14:19:55Z	
3747	@Terry Have you tried locking down your fridge over night or install the alarm once opened. In my opinion, your issue is mind issue, so you need to work on it inside your head. You won't find any fixed answer here.	2015-12-01 12:35:00Z	kenorb
3747	@Terry Have you tried Melatonin? It could change your sleeping behavior.	2015-12-01 12:36:46Z	kenorb
3747	@Terry Did Prince answer your question or are you still looking for an answer? The question keeps on bouncing to the top if no answer is accepted. You could update what your looking for or if anything has changed... Prince answer seems pretty solid to me...	2017-04-24 21:18:50Z	Narusan-in-coma
3733	If the instructions say to take it three times a day, that means every 8 hours, or as close to 8 hours as you can. So sleeping time shouldn't be much longer than any of the other gaps. Or am I not understanding your question correctly?	2015-11-14 03:02:22Z	Carey Gregory
3733	@CareyGregory yes you got me right, but what about overnight affect. Supposedly it says every 5 hours. But night can be 8-10 hours. Doesn't it looses it affect taking it after 10 hour of gap.	2015-11-14 10:59:36Z	
3700	@anongoodnurse I edited the question, is it still primarily opinion-based?	2015-11-17 16:24:22Z	
3700	I reworded your question. Instead of asking why something is a certain way, it's usually better to ask something more specific that hits the underlying issue or question that you want to ask. Unfortunately, I would suspect hospitals are simply uninformed about the consequences of this and may require a campaign to change that, similar to the history of washing hands in the hospital. I hope someone proves me wrong.	2016-01-31 22:08:14Z	Dave Liu
3698	Hello, and welcome to the site! It certainly sounds like you are going through a hard time. But please realize that we cannot, ever, diagnose somebody over the Internet! This is why we have a rule that we close all questions about somebody's personal situation, and only give information on general theory of health and medicine. This question will probably get closed, and this certainly will feel terrible to you. But please try to understand, it's not because your problems are wrong or insignificant, it's because we're the wrong place to solve them. Just like a florist or a salesman (cont.)	2015-11-12 18:02:00Z	rumtscho
3698	(cont.) cannot help you with them, we, a random bunch of people who are not even doctors, can't give you the help you need. Please don't take the lack of answers and the future closing personally, but go and seek the help of those who are qualified to give it, and whose involvement will really do something good for you. If you feel bad enough that you have to ask somebody if it's serious, it is serious. Go to a professional counselor or therapist, they don't only work with mentally ill people but also help those who are living through trouble. Good luck, we feel with you!	2015-11-12 18:04:36Z	rumtscho
3698	I've got to agree with rumtscho. I've been in a pretty similar situation, and I know how terrible you're feeling right around now. Trust me, I'd love to help. But I can't deny the fact that asking strangers on the Internet won't get you the help you want or need. What you should do is go and find someone who can really help. You say you're studying; your institution probably has someone who deals with student health. Go and find them and tell them how you're feeling. You can also reach out to me, if you want to - there's an email address in my profile. Good luck.	2015-11-12 18:15:38Z	ArtOfCode

3694	@anongoodnurse: Sorry for that. I really apologise for that. I actually got quite annoyed when saw the downvoted. I wanted to know what the case is so that I can modify my query. I know downvoting with comment often leads to vengeful voting but that doesn't mean you just downvote if you don't like. Please at-least tell what made you do so so that I can make the question better.	2015-11-17 02:41:04Z	
3693	Unless there is evidence that this is a widespread phenomenon, I think we should close this as a personal health question.	2015-11-12 17:56:28Z	rumtscho
3693	I don't have enough information to post an answer, but I believe it has to do with adrenaline production during stressful events. I'll try to answer this if I can tomorrow.	2015-11-23 03:22:47Z	Dave Liu
3682	Your question is difficult because of the word "stop." Although it's easy to measure when the heart stops, it's not so easy to measure when the brain stops because the word has no definition when speaking of the brain. By stop do you mean unconscious, permanently damaged, or actually brain dead as defined by neurologists?	2016-02-18 02:23:22Z	Carey Gregory
3682	Brain dead, when no more activity happens.	2016-02-28 10:34:12Z	
3680	meat has more calories than bread.	2015-11-11 00:49:41Z	Kate Gregory
3680	@KateGregory In general that is true, although it of course depends on the type of beef and the type of bread.  That said, the Quarter Pounder has 1 thicker patty and the Big Mac has 2 thinner ones, so I'm not sure how much difference there is in the amount of meat.  In contrast, the Big Mac has 50% more bread content plus the "special sauce".  Typically, restaurant sauces are filled with calories.	2015-11-11 00:55:15Z	
3680	True, but the QP comes with ketchup, which probably has as many calories as that "special sauce." I don't frequent McDonalds, but as I recall the QP bun is larger than the Big Mac bun, so that probably evens out the bread calories. So if the bread is roughly equal and the sauce is roughly equal, that leaves the meat. Two small patties = one big one? Don't know but probably.	2015-11-11 01:33:30Z	Carey Gregory
3680	@CareyGregory Hmmm... bun size. That's a good point. I assumed they were the same size.  Perhaps they are not. Maybe a frequent customer or staffer knows.	2015-11-11 03:45:02Z	
3680	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this is about the calorie content of a specific product and not about health	2015-11-11 10:41:28Z	YviDe

3672	Lack of sleep is so detrimental to the system, the body has a safety mechanism which, after some deprivation, forces you to go to sleep even if your rational mind doesn't want it. How would you expect to find a workaround of a major health safety mechanism which qualifies as "healthy"?

3672	But each occasion of sleep deprivation is unhealthy on its own. Your question is akin to asking "what's a healthy way to smoke a cigarette". The whole premise contradicts itself.	2015-11-16 16:18:25Z	rumtscho
3672	Ah, and in case you want some more info, look what question just happens to be on top of Bio: biology.stackexchange.com/questions/20631/…. These are just the acute effects. If you were to repeatedly derive yourself of sleep, that would add chronic effects.	2015-11-16 16:38:26Z	rumtscho
3672	@rumtscho IMO this line of reasoning is fallacious. First, some of us (at least) encourage IV drug users to use clean needles because, well, it's less bad. Second, some of us do things like work nights (:-o). This is generally because we have priorities (or indeed necessities) other than our own health that lead us to make the decision to continue such behavior. Life involves compromise. Optimizing performance and minimizing health consequences within a framework of sleep deprivation is neither contradictory nor ignoble.	2016-03-11 10:09:01Z	Susan

3648	Welcome to Health SE. This has potential to be an interesting question, but a few things need to be edited. First, we like to only have one question per post, but you ask several questions, which makes this post very broad. Also, some of the things you are asking seem to be looking for personal medical advice, which is off-topic here. Could you generalize this question so that it applies to a broader range of people. Thanks :)	2015-11-06 21:37:07Z	michaelpri
3648	Good point. Edited.  I can ask other questions in other posts. :)	2015-11-06 22:40:46Z	
3647	Do you find that you have a lot of flatulence?  Did any of the imaging show substantial air pockets?  How high on the upper right side is the pain?  It's much easier to think of ways we can show that this is NOT the case rather than testing for something to be true, which is how modern science works.  You need to eliminate your other hypotheses and be left with this one.	2015-11-13 17:32:33Z	Atl LED
3646	What exactly are we talking about here? Actually dizziness like hard to stand up or just runner's high where you feel kinda euphoric, light headed, relaxed, flexible and air headed.	2015-11-06 19:51:25Z	maplemale
3646	"Dizziness" as in light headedness almost to the point of fainting. Not a vertigo "the whole world is spinning" senation, and not a runner's high.	2015-11-06 20:02:58Z	
3646	Interesting. Most of the conditions that I am aware of (as a lay person) would also cause dizziness during exercise.	2015-11-06 20:07:49Z	JohnP
3646	Hi @JohnP (+1) - I'll relax the constraint for strictly "after" exercise (please see my edits). The reason for this is that, in my case, I definitely get hints of dizziness during exercise, but it typically does not set in until after my cooldown period.	2015-11-06 20:19:16Z	
3646	In addition to heart conditions there are some non-cardiac conditions and many meds that can do the same. Are you including those in your question or strictly heart conditions?	2015-11-07 00:52:38Z	Carey Gregory

3637	Hello, questions asking for recommendations are generally not a good fit for Stack Exchange. Please considering weighing in on this Meta discussion if you have thoughts about how these could be effectively dealt with on this site. Thanks!	2015-11-06 02:11:22Z	Susan
3637	@Susan, though this can involve opinion, I do not think it has to be considered bad. The NYT is considered a reliable source, for example, so my question is really aiming to look for a reliable source of drug reviews. Asking for reliable sources of news might return the BBC, NYT, and NPR. Some may disagree, and no source is perfect, but it is legitimate. It isn't a fake site, it is something that generally warrants trust. Do you know of any such sites for drug reviews? I doubt there are any and it would be hard to find a reliable site like that, unless it was by an NGO or something.	2015-11-07 01:09:41Z	
3637	Hi zagadka314, at the moment it looks like the top answer on that meta question says Recommendations asking for resources where you learn about medical or health related topics should be on-topic., so I am re-opening. Thanks for your patience.	2015-11-07 06:56:52Z	Susan
3637	I don't see any reason treato shouldn't be trusted, but they don't actually offer much. All they are is a search engine that goes out and plucks posts from other sites that match whatever it is you search for. If you try to read the full text of one of the posts, it actually just takes you to the web site where it was found, so you have to view all the ads on the other sites. I found it largely useless and annoying.	2015-11-10 00:06:05Z	Carey Gregory

3635	Hrm. Interesting, but at 31 calories for the entire 1/8 oz I don't know how significant the abosrbed calories would be, especially when weighed against the calories lost from the turkey in the cooking process. Might be a wash, but as you say, I'm not exactly sure how you'd quanity it outside a lab. This might be a better question for the food SE, I'll ask one of their moderators.	2015-11-05 19:32:19Z	JohnP
3635	Your answer puts things into perspective, but still made me long for my own lab or even just the chance to visit one. Since so many other things previously unattainable have been made available to the average consumer (e.g., water purifiers, drones, movie making software, ...) I wondered why something so beneficial to health hadn't been developed. Then I discovered someone has already taken steps to move this from a lab to the hands of the consumer. GE to the rescue!  About a year ago GE developed a prototype according to this article here: goo.gl/YM8rIy. Anyone know how safe this is?	2015-11-06 17:03:12Z	
3635	Watching bomb calorimetry is kind of fun, our college had a lab that did that. As far as your question about safety, I don't know. You'd have to research.	2015-11-06 17:27:53Z	JohnP

3627	Are you asking about causes or about treatment? It seems that you assume that your problem should disappear once whatever caused it disappears, but this is not really necessary. It can happen, or the problem, once triggered, can persist.	2015-11-05 18:59:38Z	rumtscho
3627	Hi @rumtscho (+1) - I guess I'm not really sure what you're asking. But I am looking for the cause here. Once we know the cause, the treatment (or  lack thereof) should be obvious. In my case, I'm not responding to any of the normal things that GERD patients respond to. For instance, some people respond by losing weight and eating a better diet. I've done both of these and still reflux daily. Most people respond to PPIs, I don't. So I'm wondering if there are other causes for a dysfunctional LES (neuroligcal? MS? etc.) that wouldn't be treated by diet and PPIs.	2015-11-07 00:19:40Z	
3627	Hi there @smeeb, we cannot diagnose you here. The wording of your questions lends itself towards that direction. If you reworded it into a more general case, say "What are possible causes for ____ given these current conditions, X, Y and Z?" we might be able to answer that, but in the the given state, I believe it's likely to be closed.	2015-12-02 22:15:38Z	Dave Liu

3618	Of course, also treat your skin infection properly. Here are some suggestions:	2017-04-25 21:19:58Z	tealhill
3618	In the US, terbinafine (e.g. Lamisil AT) is the strongest nonprescription treatment. Or you can use clotrimazole (e.g. Lotrimin), miconazole (e.g. Micatin), or tolnaftate (e.g. Tinactin); but they aren't as strong. ❧ Read and follow the label. ❧ Apply it to the affected area plus a few extra centimeters. Continue for a week or two after the rash is gone. (Source.) Also follow these tips.	2017-04-25 21:20:22Z	tealhill
3618	If a fungal infection persists, it can spread to the soles of the feet — or to the toenails. A toenail infection is ugly, and can be very difficult to cure. ❧ If four weeks of treatment don't cure your athlete's foot, you may need prescription medication. Visit your doctor.	2017-04-25 21:20:39Z	tealhill

3585	The one problem i can see is how your body reacts with no food for the rest of the day.  The 2000 calories may be enough for a whole day, but I would wonder how much of that gets stored for later and how much goes to waste.  The other problem is you are fasting for the rest of the day, and your body works differently when fasting versus eating throughout the day.  More questions than answers, but it's something to think about.  Unfortunately, there's too many unknowns I don't know about either.  Just remember, you get hungry because your stomach is empty, not because of needed calories.	2015-12-10 05:36:37Z	dakre18

"The Romans believed it was healthier to eat only one meal a day," she says. "They were obsessed with digestion and eating more than one meal was considered a form of gluttony. This thinking impacted on the way people ate for a very long time.""	2017-06-19 06:26:36Z	Count Iblis

3578	I think this applies to every human who strains his body in combination with not providing the needed energy?

3578	@MarchHo It is way too broad. Something like How does lactic acid build up contribute to muscle soreness would be an answerable question. There are too many parts that would need to be explained to provide a proper, referenced answer and would be too long for this format.	2015-10-30 01:20:31Z

I perceived this as "all my floaters have decided to get in my way at once" more than "whoa, look at all the new floaters!", for what that's worth.	2015-10-28 03:01:51Z

3448	Could you please clarify whether you are asking about irregular sleep without or with sleep deprivation?	2016-01-13 19:34:53Z	YviDe
3429	Hmmm....I'm  not entirely sure that this site is the best for the question. While it may be affecting your sleep, the basic question is "How do I test for EMF interference", which is not a health issue. I'll leave this open to see how the community feels.	2015-10-16 17:41:45Z	JohnP
3429	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's not about health. It would perhaps fit on electronics.SE.	2015-10-16 20:54:36Z	Carey Gregory
3429	I beg to differ only because while the title mentions electronics (tools), the overall context / concern / application is around health.  This may help illustrate:  I spoke to a specialist in EMF health and asked which of the devices are more useful and tend to help most in detecting potential health issues.  The specialist said the voltmeter was less useful than the gaussmeter, and that some ranges of radio frequencies impact human biology more than others.  That's the kind of information I hoped to find here more than in electronics.se.  Perhaps I should reword title to "..for sleep impact"?	2015-10-18 04:47:59Z	
3429	Then you should probably reword the entire question more to reflect the desired results, something such as "What are the health impacts of EMF interference in a bedroom?", which while possibly broad, is much more on topic than "How do I test for EMF because I think it's causing sleep problems?" The why of wanting to test in that second example is outweighed by the basic "How do I test for EMF?".	2015-10-19 21:35:33Z	JohnP
3429	By EMF, you mean Electromotive force or electromagnetic field? In any case small devices would not create strong fields that can have if at all any effect on the brain. At least humans are not known to have that keen a sense of electric fields.	2015-10-20 08:07:50Z	WYSIWYG

3405	as i see it, the gaining of weight is a symptom of an unhealthy lifestyle, and even if there is a way to loose the extra weight without doing exercise, this might be actually a bad idea. rather try to make your life sane again, because as kind of mentioned by @CareyGregory, if you really can't find a few times 30min of time a week, you have bigger problems then just gaining weight, like stress. for whatever reason you have no time (work, children, ...), remember that if you get more and more sick, you will not be able to be a good partner, parent, employee or whatever.	2015-10-16 10:06:29Z	hoijui

3399	I personally appreciate that you've given the backstory, however, the two conditions are both common. Did you do any research before asking here? What did you find confusing? It's much easier to start from a knowledge base (even with confusion) than from a blank slate.	2015-10-13 19:43:13Z	anongoodnurse
3399	@anongoodnurse I looked at a number of online sources (WebMD, Healthline, Mayo Clinic) although mostly for gallbladder related things; much of this research happened before she even went to the doctor, to convince her to GO to the doctor. I will edit some things into the question.	2015-10-14 13:46:31Z	
3397	I can't give you a real professionally-backed opinion, but my mother has it, and I might but we've never confirmed it (in my case it seems to be chronic unexplained migraines often manifesting as vertigo / nausea). From her experiences and what I've observed, no activities have any effect on the disease itself, but the disease can make activities themselves dangerous. For example, an activity that requires balance would be unwise during a minor attack, not because you can damage your sense of balance further, but because you can hurt yourself. So I think that...	2017-04-27 20:37:51Z	Jason C
3397	.. it really varies and basically comes down to the patient's own conscious judgment and comfort. My mother, for example, refused to drive a vehicle during mild attacks or when she felt one coming on, just as a policy, sort of like how a responsible person might give somebody their car keys before drinking. It's more of a "be safe and comfortable" kind of thing. Comfort, too, e.g. some folks may get irritated by certain noises, so obviously they should try to avoid them. Others may not, and so no need. It varies greatly.	2017-04-27 20:39:30Z	Jason C
3394	Did you happen to research this? If so, what did you find (was this universal? Did any source go into more detail?)	2015-10-12 22:30:54Z	anongoodnurse

3393	Fear and stress is your main enemy.	2015-10-15 17:37:38Z	kenorb
3393	not all allergies are dangerous. I developed a shrimp allergy as an adult (old enough to enjoy shrimp and regularly order it in restaurants) but I don't have an anaphylactic reaction, I just throw up every hour for about 12 hours. (Or did; not surprisingly I haven't had shrimp in over 30 years.) An allergy like that won't kill you. So when you read about adult-onset allergies, don't assume that means your health or life is in danger.	2015-10-17 00:41:25Z	Kate Gregory

3383	These are two completely separate articles. The suppressing inflammation is taken out of context from the section on when first noticing symptoms of tendinitis, not after a lengthy period. The first article is written in support of PRP, which is a mechanically induced state of inflammation. They aren't related.	2015-10-12 14:50:53Z	JohnP
3383	@JohnP For suppressing inflammation,  I've added a WebMD reference. What's the issue with the TheHuffingtonPost article? PRP is just one way amongst others to induce inflammation, and is mentionned as an example.	2015-10-12 19:17:02Z	
3383	I'm just pointing out that you are using two different sources that describe treatments for different phases of injury to "be at odds". PRP is used to treat chronic (As I understand it), while the ice/suppressing inflammation is used when the injury/stress is still in the acute stage. They aren't really contradictory statements.	2015-10-12 19:25:54Z	JohnP
3383	@JohnP Good point, I agree, my understanding is the same, I guess the answer would distinguish early phase from the rest of the recovery, and ideally give some criteria to define approximately when the early phase ends. (and I also guess my comment will be deleted since it contains some elements of answer…)	2015-10-13 15:36:47Z

3355	I'm voting to close because I think the question as posed is unclear and too broad to be answered. For starters I think you need to define what you consider to be blindness. The numbers you mention appear to be the myopia correction values used by optometrists when writing lens prescriptions, but does severe myopia constitute blindness?	2015-10-10 02:03:15Z	Carey Gregory
3355	I think you don't understand.  -6 doesn't mean your eyes are weak, it means they are focusing too close.  It's a measure of the corrective lenses needed to give normal vision.  My wife has been extremely nearsighted her whole life, -9 or worse in the decades I've known her.  If anything her vision has improved slightly over that time--it's an annoyance, not a sign of impending blindness.	2015-10-11 04:06:50Z	Loren Pechtel
3355	"He is really very upset and he even doesn’t want to discuss anything on this." Yes, and this is why people are entitled to privacy of their medical information. Prying is rude.

3321	Welcome to the site. Just out of curiosity, how much research have you done about this? For example, there are genetic and acquired PCD, and if yours is acquired, can it be passed on?

3267	Welcome to health SE :-). Have you tested for iron deficiency? It is a simple blood test, one can test hemoglobin levels, iron levels and even iron deposits (which are empty if you have severe iron deficit). It would be especially useful if you could compare the results after you started feeling like this to some previous results when you felt fine, if you have them. Your questions are answerable without this information, but if you suspect a certain health condition, you ought to do some tests.	2015-09-29 11:01:47Z	Lucky
3267	@Lucky I have not, no. I had a big health check up about six months ago and that didn't flag up anything unusual. The trouble is that if I am iron deficient it's going to be only slight and it's not going to be all the time. The "symptoms" I have are very minor.	2015-09-29 12:06:32Z

3202	I edited your question to make it less subjective, I believe the "should" cast it more into medical advice and personal, both of which are close reasons.

3197	Could you clarify what you mean by “supplement”? The title just says “pill”, so I thought you were talking about pharmaceuticals of any sort, but after that you use “supplement” which makes me wonder if you’re talking about micronutrient (vitamin/mineral) supplements only? (In that case someone might be able to help you divide them up into fat vs water soluble, but I’m not sure there’s going to be a practically applicable answer other than to look at the pharmacokinetic studies for each substance. But if we can narrow it down a bit that would be a good start.)	2015-09-22 01:16:33Z	Susan

3193	There are answers to these questions, however, the way the question(s) is(are) framed now, it's a bit broad. It's understandable that all the information you seek would be in one place. The policy, though, is one question at a time. If you can imagine a chapter of a book answering this question, it is too broad.	2015-09-21 18:26:44Z	anongoodnurse
3193	Just what I wanted to say. I could for example answer something about the medicines, but for the first and the third question someone else would be more competent.

3193	@anongoodnurse , @ Lucky :  I have edited my question to make it more precise.	2015-09-22 01:29:29Z	
3192	This is very unclear. Are you talking about food or supplementation? What is a "big difference"? Are we talking about a person with defficiency in either B6 or amino acids, and if there is a defficiency, is it caused by inappropriate diet, or by some pathological condition? Also what do you mean by "how", are you interested in the exact biochemistry of amino acids absorption in the gut, or something else?	2015-09-21 13:38:50Z	rumtscho

3194	First, I would wonder why you would want to live on a liquid diet for long periods of time. While you may get everything needed to survive technically, it will effect your entire GI tract. The pancreas has a much shorter time to respond to rapid increases of food in and out of the stomach. The colon does appreciate fiber to create the proper stool consistency. I do not have the luxury of eating much solid food any longer. I use a mix of protein shakes, smoothies, yogurts, soups, broths, etc. My stretch foods are breads that I dip in soup, cream cheese on saltine crackers, eggs, and other soft	2017-06-26 06:34:42Z	Lilibete

3185	For the "& in what way" part of the question, are you asking for the biological mechanisms behind changing metabolisms?  The studies I know off hand are from people who were starving due to circumstance (not anorexia), but I think it will be generalizable.  I'm going to start a lit review to be sure, but if the case is similar to say, a starving child, then the answer will be yes, though if growth has been stunted the delay will often persist.	2015-09-21 00:00:34Z	Atl LED
3185	@Atl That's definitely a good part of what I'm looking for. Would you mind providing sources?	2015-09-24 05:08:41Z	
3183	If you want a constructive answer, you may want to specify why you are experiencing hair loss. Hair on your face tends to stay there in the absense of a medical condition. If your doctor hasn't provided you with a diagnosis, you may want to ask for one, or even get a second opinion. Most forms of hair loss are at least somewhat treatable, if you know what's causing them.	2015-09-20 18:54:09Z	TheEnvironmentalist

3180	Not my downvote, but there are a few things that make this question difficult to answer - firstly it contains several different questions. Are you interested in types of flu vaccines or advice on communicating with your doctor? Secondly, there is much more to determining a suitable vaccine for someone than age. E.g. vaccines produced on chicken embryos are not suitable for people allergic to eggs (nothing to do with age) etc. Many contraindications and precautions are listed at the website you linked. If you could make your question more specific, it still might be salvaged.	2015-09-20 10:22:14Z	Lucky
3180	Oh, and by specific I don't mean asking for personalised health advice, that's strictly off topic - we cannot recommend a specific vaccine for you nor your parents or anyone else over the internet.

3167	@briantist yes, that makes more sense :-). @ Dan sorry I misinterpreted your question, but it is still very broad. Mechanism of toxicity for most toxins isn't inflammation, but people ("health gurus") classify all sorts of substances as toxins.

3158	Welcome to health SE :-). Since you are already checking your biochemical parameters/lipid status and BP there must be a physician involved who can advise you on the meaning of these results.

Placebo effect is a beneficial effect of a treatment, based on patient's belief, and the body of the question seems to be about experiencing symptoms that you read about. That being said, the question seems to be asking for personalized advice - if you edit it to make it a bit more general, you will make sure that it remains on-topic.	2015-09-16 10:45:05Z	Lucky

3146	Thank you though. This does seem to fit. Do you know or know where I can learn whether this psychosomatic symptom will persist?	2015-09-16 10:54:15Z	
3146	That's just the thing - I can't tell whether it is psychosomatic or not, nor can I make any prognosis. Firstly, this sort of thing cannot be done on-line, it has to be done by a physician in person (this is why personal medical advice is off-topic here), and secondly it isn't my area of expertise. I just wanted to clarify what your question is about - I didn't try to make a diagnosis, because I can't. As for the terminology - don't worry, that's what comments are for - to clarify a question when something is unclear.	2015-09-16 11:25:44Z	Lucky

The tissue grows back entirely smooth, much smoother than the surrounding tissue! p.s. it hurts rather alot and a liquid diet will be required to avoid complication in the work up to the extraction site becoming fully healed.	2015-10-30 23:10:03Z	user19679

The site tour and help section will provide more information about the site, as will a quick look at meta. Thanks, and again, welcome.	2015-12-05 12:55:58Z	anongoodnurse
3106	@YviDe, thank you :)	2015-12-05 18:14:38Z	
3106	Are you asking if these antidepressants are DRIs?	2015-12-22 01:13:10Z	HDE 226868
3106	@HDE226868 So antidepressants that are DRIs can treat ADHD?	2015-12-23 20:52:57Z	
3106	From what I understand, yes, but I'm not positive.	2015-12-24 13:29:26Z	HDE 226868
3097	Perhaps you can explain what you mean by partially healed? The answer does depend on your definition. Thanks. :)	2015-10-27 02:45:00Z	anongoodnurse
3097	@anongoodnurse added pretty much the description my doctor gave me (it has fully healed now, too). Apparently my other ear had went, too, but I didn't notice it whatsoever.	2015-10-27 09:33:59Z	
3089	I would expect quad injuries to mainly only happen to people involved in strenuous sports or jobs. Are you asking about people with sedentary jobs who then go out and participate in sports, or just everyone in general?	2015-09-10 17:36:31Z	Carey Gregory
3089	Well yes, sedentary jobs but definitely not a sedentary lifestyle.	2015-09-10 18:15:11Z	
3089	I have seen much info over the last few months to validate that prolonged sitting tightens the psoas muscles which tightens hip flexors and quads and leads me to believe that my hypothesis is correct. I will continue investigating before posting a full answer.	2015-12-19 20:59:57Z	
3072	Even if you can, I highly doubt that standard commercially available earphones can do it, as depicted in your screenshots. Did the movie specify the exact mechanism? Was it the loudness of the sound or did they presuppose a sound pattern which magically triggers something akin to a self-destruction mechanism in the brain? Movies from that era tend to reflect a fear of brainwashing which seems to have been perceived as a realistic cold-war threat.	2015-09-09 13:11:01Z	rumtscho
3069	What sources say that ear tubes (I guess you are referring to tympanostomy?) are the primary treatment for chronic ear infections? Doesn't it depend on severity of the symptoms? I understand your reasoning, but for such a complex question a few resources to back up your arguments would be very useful to someone who would try to answer (IMO). Thanks!	2015-09-09 12:01:24Z	Lucky
3069	As for the terminology - it differs across countries, so I just wanted to clarify (that's what the comments are for, after all). It seemed by the way the question was constructed that you already had done some research before posting, so I simply asked you politely to share it with the rest of us :-). The request for prior research is not solely mine, it is a request agreed upon by the community. For more information please refer to the help centre and meta.	2015-09-09 17:34:38Z	Lucky
3069	If most of life took place after nasopharyngectomy, that paper would be relevant.	2015-09-11 08:13:14Z	Susan
3069	It’s not one specific form of the complaint; it’s people who have had their nasopharynx removed, usually as salvage therapy for cancer.  The anatomy in the region of the Eustachian tube is....different. Not saying it isn’t interesting, but it does not support your contention that a Google search yielded quick data about this alternative for chronic ear infections that anongoognurse has inappropriately neglected.	2015-09-11 08:38:42Z	Susan
3069	After you clarified the exact nature of your question, I think it has to be closed. For details why I think so, please see meta.health.stackexchange.com/questions/422/….	2015-09-11 11:25:54Z	rumtscho
3066	I think deadlifting for first time caused this. Should i continue to lift?	2015-09-08 18:14:39Z	
3066	This is not something that can really be diagnosed over the internet, I would recommend that you see a health care professional.	2015-09-08 19:10:34Z	JohnP
3058	fitness.stackexchange.com/questions/18/… - Bottom line, it's really up to personal preference.	2015-09-08 19:26:03Z	JohnP
3058	@JohnP the linked question is about boosting someone's metabolism - a read this question differently: the best time when you take various conditions into account. For example, I was told by my PE teacher a long time ago, that doing exercise in the evening is easier, because your muscles and joints have moved a little during the day (in the morning they are all stiff), and doing exercise in the morning helps reduce this stiffness. So perhaps the OP is looking for arguments on which they would base their decision/preference? @ OP - can you please specify if this is what you are looking for?	2015-09-09 12:06:30Z	Lucky
3058	@Lucky - The question title is "Is there a best time of the day to exercise", with the addendum that it is for weight loss. In either case, the base answer there stands. It's personal preference, since in any exercise you should do some kind of warmup first, whether it's in the evening or some other time.	2015-09-24 22:45:13Z	JohnP
3055	Hello Eli! The Stack Exchange sites are not for asking about personal opinions. Your question can probably be edited into something which fits our format, but currently, it sounds like it will be closed soon. So, what do you want to know about Omega 3 supplements exactly, besides personal opinions?	2015-09-08 09:02:15Z	rumtscho
3055	@rumtscho Thank you for letting me know that information about the forum! I want to know, about the Omega 3, - if people really suggest to use it or not, is it good to take it once a day or should I just eat food that contains it. In addition, I will edit my question.	2015-09-08 09:43:47Z	
3055	If this is really what you are looking for, you came to the wrong site. We have a specific voting system which works great for people who are looking for objective, verifiable information, but breaks down when it comes to judging the quality of opinions, so we don't do these at all. If you want to make your decision yourself, but you are missing a specific piece of information, we'll do our best to provide that. But if you want to just know what others think and whether they prefer to take it or not, I'm afraid we are really the wrong place, and your question will be closed.	2015-09-08 11:29:21Z	rumtscho
3055	Welcome to Health SE. I'm afraid that this question is at a high risk for closure, because it is asking for opinions, which, as said above, is off-topic here. We still may be able to salvage this, though. Are you looking for anything specific about Omega 3 supplements?	2015-09-09 04:08:13Z	michaelpri

3049	Would you like to ask the writers? Only they can answer this question. Would you like this migrated to Movies and TV.SE?	2015-09-07 03:15:36Z	anongoodnurse
3049	@anongoodnurse - No, because the question is medical - "Does heroin, or heroin withdrawal, lead to grand mal seizures?"	2015-09-07 03:17:50Z	
3049	@anongoodnurse - I see what you're saying, so I edited the post to make it more general.	2015-09-07 03:23:05Z	
3049	It is possible that the show isn't medically accurate. Many TV shows are not medically accurate. What happened in the show could be for a more dramatic effect.	2015-09-07 04:11:35Z	michaelpri
3049	I currently know a young woman who is detoxing from heroin. She has only been in detox for 1 week and a half, and has had 2 grand mal seizures.	2016-01-19 17:37:59Z	
3043	I've read that there is even a difference in color of lungs of non-smokers between those who have lived most of their lives in rural areas and in cities (and we're not talking about cities like Beijing here, just ordinary cities like London).	2015-09-06 17:02:44Z	Count Iblis
3043	@CountIblis I'd be happy to see that as an answer if you can find the references. It might only be a partial answer but partial is okay.	2015-09-07 05:06:48Z	
3043	I went to a medical summer camp when a couple years ago and they passed out a normal lung and a smoker's lung. The lungs were definitely real and the smoker's lung was black and not nearly as healthy looking as the normal lung.	2017-11-24 06:18:19Z	Ayomide Manns
3043	@FredrikEich Thank you for adding links to the sources of the statements I quoted; however, the link to the source of Dr. Carr's statement didn't contain that quote, so I removed it.	2018-01-09 00:57:29Z	
3034	You have a very simplistic view of cohort studies. Even if we could find a goal variable (= some way of measure "healthy"), which is already an exceedingly tough problem, we have tons of confounding variables which correlate with your two conditions, such as exposure to smog, access to different food, access to different levels of medical care, different stress levels, access to gyms, etc. So, if somebody ever made a study, found out that big city people are on average healthier than rural people, and concluded that it's due to more walking to work, this would be an example for bad science.	2015-09-05 12:49:11Z	rumtscho
3034	How can walking a few blocks and climbing a few stairs be "physically strenuous" for anyone other than extremely obese people, people who suffer from serious illness etc.?	2015-09-06 17:31:14Z	Count Iblis
3034	Is this taking into account the high(er) levels of air pollution?	2016-01-28 22:38:43Z	HDE 226868
3034	Your question now is basically "Why is walking healthy". Would you mind editing your question so that body and title are more descriptive of the problem?	2017-09-17 14:59:02Z	Narusan-in-coma
3033	Did you do any research into this question by any chance? Could you share what you found? Thanks, and welcome to the site. :-)	2015-09-04 19:46:22Z	anongoodnurse
3032	I'm sorry not to be more diplomatic, but the last line and a previous line ("why bother going to the doctor when I can get more information on my own first.") together seem amusing to me.	2015-09-05 10:09:25Z	anongoodnurse

2019	The general idea you are asking about is very interesting, but I think that you would get better answers if you edited your question to narrow it down a bit, make it more precise. There are many types of medicines used for cough (not trying to answer in comment, but just to illustrate): antitussives, expectorants, bronchodilators (in some cases) etc. and each group contains sub-groups with different mechanisms. As for herbal syrups - depends on the herbs they contain. Chicken soup and raspberry tea are more of folk remedies for common cold, than for cough per se. The answer would be too long.	2015-09-03 19:40:09Z	Lucky
2019	@Lucky thank you so much for naming those classes of medicines, that's partially what I wanted.	2015-09-03 22:44:29Z	
2014	Welcome to Health SE. I'm afraid that this question is too broad in its current state. You ask three separate question, and they are all pretty broad by themselves. If you can narrow this question down, please flag for reopening.	2015-09-04 01:02:38Z	michaelpri
2011	To answer this question I think you would need to read the manufacturer's instructions for the specific product since they may not all be the same.	2015-09-02 21:38:16Z	Carey Gregory

2007	There are sites on SE that deal with "what if" scenarios, including Worldbuilding.SE. Biology.SE deals with questions about evolution. This site deals more with health issues. As a doc myself, my stance is that since our atmosphere is what it is, and breathing a different %O2 would be impossible for all but a few without great expense, the point is moot. (I would propose, however, that NASA docs are not slackers; if there were a better %O2, the people up there would be breathing it. If you doubt NASA docs, read about Joe Kittinger and other test pilots.)	2015-08-31 18:44:20Z	anongoodnurse
2007	@anongoodnurse  My question isn't about "what if" scenarios, it has nothing to do with evolution, and breathing different oxygen ratios happens all the time, I'm just asking about the long term effects.  I'm asking about health, that's why I posted in Health.  As for relevance, there are plenty of people who deal with oxygen ratios and air recycling every day: scuba divers, astronauts, submariners, and high-altitude climbers, just to name a few.	2015-08-31 18:50:38Z	
2007	Please forgive me. I mistook the "I'm working on a science-fiction story..." for "what if", and the fact that we evolved in an atmosphere of 21% O2 making a "better" ratio more "beneficial" to be theoretical. "breathing different oxygen ratios happens all the time" - not long term (hence my comment.) I know (as I suspect you do) that O2 rich air is toxic to lungs. Ventilator studies will bear that out. Maybe you can start there.	2015-08-31 18:53:52Z	anongoodnurse
2007	@anongoodnurse No problem! The "science-fiction story" bit was just backstory to explain my reason for asking, and when I said "more beneficial" I meant in terms of improving a person's health. For example, nitrox gives scuba divers increased energy, but might have other detrimental effects over time (I'm not sure).  I didn't mean better for our species, I'm asking about the health effects of differing levels of O2 for an individual, long-term.  But, apology accepted.  :)	2015-08-31 18:58:44Z

1971	Addendum: I tried to keep the description of the story from being too graphic, but if it's still too explicit for this SE site, I understand if someone would edit it. also, I won't link the particular story since that would probably negatively affect our rankings on search engines and might even get us into trouble with corporate filters.	2015-08-27 07:32:27Z	
1968	Why was it tested?  (This actually is relevant. If there were truly "no symptoms", it's hard to see why we even have this information. Sometimes, though, it's checked to evaluate another lab abnormality (e.g. hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), for instance. This may affect the treatment decision.) Also, cortisol levels have a circadian oscillation, so it's not possible to interpret a value without knowing at what point in the circadian cycle (e.g. hours after habitual wake) it was obtained.	2016-03-09 21:05:37Z	Susan
1968	It was just a routine screening with my endocrinologist... I complained that I have a hard time to build muscle and I did more than 50 blood tests..I made this exam at 8 a.m if I remember right... But I usually wake up about noon...	2016-03-10 02:11:15Z

1948	A quick look did find this article at the NIH website which shows altitude changes and cold as risk factors, but I don't understand the why behind it, so hopefully someone with more knowledge can elaborate.	2015-08-24 20:06:43Z	JohnP
1948	@Carolyn - Were your friends concerned with ear infection risk with flights, or did they specifically mention altitude of the destination?	2015-08-25 05:29:03Z	anongoodnurse
1948	In fact we were on foot, and arrived in the area by train, so no rapid changes in elevation were involved. We went from 1000 m to 2700 over the course of a couple days of hiking. It was well- meaning passers by that stopped us on the trail with their concern about her ears while at altitude, not about shifts in altitude.	2015-08-25 05:33:53Z

1868	Are you asking if BPA is a health concern, or if canned food linings contain BPA?	2015-12-19 15:15:57Z	HDE 226868
1868	@HDE226868 Both, essentially. If BPA is never a health concern, that'd answer the question. If BPA is never used in can linings, that'd also answer the question. Or perhaps BPA is a health concern in some cases and can linings contain it, but are still not a health concern due to the quantities involved, the fact that they're for storage not heating, or some other factor. I don't know, I've just seen people make the general claim about can linings being "bad", hence the question.	2015-12-19 16:03:31Z	
1868	Okay, thanks. I covered both of those in my answer.	2015-12-19 16:35:42Z	HDE 226868
1865	Hi, and welcome to the site! Not your downvoter, and don't know why it was downvoted, but you might get a better response if you include your research. I know I would be happy to answer this question if you did show your (real) research efforts.	2015-08-13 19:53:10Z	anongoodnurse

1852	Moderate-to-severe fungal nail infections are difficult to treat, and 15% to 20% of successfully-treated cases relapse within a year. If you have a healthy immune system and you are free of diabetes, you could let the infection progress instead. (Every time your toenail fungus spreads beyond the nails, you should definitely cure your new case of athlete's foot. Lamisil Once film-forming solution is the most-convenient treatment option.)	2016-07-24 07:02:55Z	tealhill
1852	Mentholated chest rub, such as Vicks VapoRub, is useful for treating fungal nail infections. If used nightly, it reduces the ugly appearance of the infection. It also has a mild antifungal effect, though I used it for perhaps a year and it didn't produce even a partial cure. It only provided cosmetic improvements.	2016-07-24 07:14:37Z	tealhill
1852	If topical treatment doesn't cure your toenail fungus, and if you still want to fight the fungi, oral medications are usually the way to go. There exist quite a few options. Which oral medications have you tried? Were you allergic to all of them?	2016-07-24 07:14:46Z	tealhill
1846	Welcome to Health.SE! This might be a borderline question. I will not however vote close yet. Are you on antibiotics? What did the cultures say? Obviously it is some kind of inflammation. You should update your question. It is a kind of rebus now.	2015-08-10 13:50:07Z	arkiaamu
1846	Did you break a bone or injure yourself in that location recently? I'm not a doctor but that doesn't look like empetigo at all, or even a rash for that matter. It looks like cellulitis, which could be secondary to osteomyelitis. I would be very surprised if the doctor who diagnosed osteomyelitis didn't insist on beginning antibiotics.	2015-08-10 20:44:44Z	Carey Gregory

1825	70 kg. I find it difficult to sleep if i go to bed hungry, but light dinners help me to wake me up early because they leave me hungry by breakfast. I'm trying to eat enough so that i'm not trying to sleep on a empty stomach but still eating no more then i must,	2015-08-09 07:21:38Z	
1825	It sounds like you're figuring out the balance on your own. If you're having trouble sleeping or waking up too early because you're hungry, then you should eat a little more for dinner.	2015-08-09 16:11:40Z	Nate Barbettini

1819	I have two friends who almost never wash their hands.  They get sick less than my friends who wash their hands all the time.  So, without a controlled study, it's hard to know if even washing hands has a positive effect.  It seems like it should, but it's hard to know without good data.	2016-01-30 01:28:25Z	RockPaperLizard

1795	What @arkiaamu said. Since your father's reasoning seems to be that he won't live long enough for long-term damage to matter, I guess we need an idea of what he considers short-term.	2015-08-05 20:42:35Z	Carey Gregory

1762	There are too many possibilities here to address (let alone that the question asks for very personalized advice.) The box on the upper left hand side of this page states: Health Stack Exchange... is not intended as a substitute for individualized diagnosis and treatment by a qualified healthcare provider. Despite your problems with doctors, they are still better than the internet.	2015-08-02 20:15:24Z	anongoodnurse
1762	@anongoodnurse I wasn't looking for individualized diagnosis and treatment. Maybe my question isn't very clear, but my goal is to figure out what my next steps are. I tried to include a lot of background information to help with this. Jellobear's answer was very helpful in that regard. I was wondering if there is another path I could take or another kind of doctor I should see. Or maybe even another test I could benefit from (such as one concerning allergies).	2015-08-02 20:30:26Z	
1762	It's best to ask those specific questions and minimize all the personal history. I believe the question can be generalized to be helpful to more people (which is my measure for personal medical questions.)	2015-08-02 20:36:17Z	anongoodnurse
1762	@anongoodnurse I just created a new question about air filters and tried to make it more broad and general. I think I understand how to write questions now. Do you think I asked that one well?	2015-08-04 11:32:45Z	
1749	The test setting is not clear. Were the blood tests done after an individual was fed with different foods? Were all the tests done on one individual or on different individuals? If multiple individuals were involved, how many tests were done in each individual? These may affect the interpretation of the graph.	2015-08-09 10:50:15Z	rnso
1749	I've been wandering the same thing as @arkiaamu in the edit of their answer: is it IgG (as in the title of the question) or IgA (as in the body of the question) - there can be quite a difference. Or would you like all three discussed (but still it would be good to know which ones are compared in your picture).	2015-08-09 17:39:44Z	Lucky
1749	@Lucky - Apologies. I have updated the heading. The question pertains to IgG and IgE.	2015-08-12 06:23:19Z

1740	Hi there, and welcome to health.SE! I modified your question because we can't really provide suggestions about dealing with the cough (that would be giving personal medical advice and we probably don't have enough information), so instead I reworded it to ask what kind of help you should look for.

1710	The symptoms you describe can be caused by a wide range of things, and it is impossible to tell on-line how serious it is or what course of action you should take. It is not about the amount of detail that you provide (you have given a lot of those) but the fact that some things can simply be determined only in person. I have one piece of "advice" though: disagreement with something a therapist or a physician said is no reason to give up on healthcare practitioners - you can either state your concerns to the professional you are seeing at that moment, or go to another one for a second opinion.	2015-07-27 13:25:18Z	Lucky
1710	Welcome to Health SE! Here on Health, we cannot reliably answer this question, as it is a personal medical question. There are too many factors and too much information that we don't have access to, so we can't properly diagnose you.

1706	This doesn't warrant a new answer (the existing one is very good), but to answer one of your questions that isn't addressed - twins are usually detected during an ultrasound starting from as early as 5 weeks. At that point, there will be two or more gestational sacs visible. If they are both viable, from week 6 onward, two or more embryos are visible.	2015-10-18 13:53:14Z	YviDe

In some cases this also can be a result of injury (catheterization, children putting things into urethra, bicycle accidents, ...) or inflammation.

1696	What do you mean by "satisfying answer"? You are asking "why do some painkillers work for me and others not", and you got the (correct) answer that pain (and the effects of medicine on it) is a subjective perception different between people. Note that 1) nobody can tell you what causes the idionsyncrasies of your subjective experience of pain, and 2) explaining even the known parts of the biochemical action of the 6 drugs you listed will fill books and won't give you a clue as to why the effect on you personally is at the level it is. So what answer are you really looking for?	2015-07-30 12:51:34Z	rumtscho
1696	@rumtscho Well, I was looking for a more specific answer. Both answers over on the Biology Stack aren't bad, but are more general than what I was looking for. I like the answer by arkiaamu, because it answers (some of) the specific examples. I was hoping for a simple answer with predictive value, but if there's none, there just is none.	2015-07-30 19:54:49Z	
1696	Also, I was hoping for advice such as "have yourself tested for X" or "you really should ask your doctor Y", but perhaps that's a question by itself.	2015-07-30 19:56:10Z	
1692	The problem with medication and even some herbal teas is that they are first tested in adults, and data for children are often lacking or insufficient, so a precautionary principle ("better safe than sorry") is applied. I wanted to suggest that you look into Melissa tea, but I ran into that obstacle - from European Medicines Agency website: "The use in children under 12 years of age has not been established due to lack of adequate data." A direct consultation with a physician (and looking for a 2nd opinion in person if you are not satisfied or have concerns) is your best option (IMO).	2015-07-24 23:49:59Z	Lucky

1692	@vsync You need to do a little more research. Melatonin is produced by the body before sleep begins, as well as during sleep, and is a big part of what makes us feel "sleepy". I have observed first-hand the efficacy of using it as a sleep aid, as I detailed in my question. It likely doesn't work for everyone, or in all circumstances, but it has definitely proven effective for my situation.	2015-07-29 14:31:55Z

He prescribed me Minera and inserted into my uterus. It also works as a contraption and is effective for up to five years and is said to eliminate periods completely.

1688	Let me make sure I understand. Let's say you go out and exercise and then rest until your breathing and heart rate are back to normal. If you then stretch major muscle groups, your respiratory rate increases. The same thing happens if you eat a large meal before stretching. But if you do the same stretching without prior exercise or food, your breathing remains normal. Is that correct?	2015-07-24 14:05:15Z	Carey Gregory
1688	Yes. Although "back to normal" might not be technically correct, since the body is regenerating/digesting, which requires blood, oxygen and energy.	2015-07-24 14:11:30Z	
1688	Understood, but I meant your respiratory and heart rates only. Those are back to normal resting levels, right?	2015-07-24 21:51:57Z	Carey Gregory
1688	Yes, that's correct	2015-07-25 20:20:56Z	
1688	Maybe you could borrow a heart-rate monitor (like the ones that can be strapped to your chest), then post the data here in your question? This seems like a difficult situation to explain, and there could be many factors involved.	2016-05-11 17:02:49Z	tniles09
1685	You have a bunch of partial truths there - your friend has oversimplified things (or has heard/read them in a simplified version). What do you mean by "a bad idea" - the painkiller might not work or it might have toxic effects on the liver or both? (Which aspect did you hope to see discussed in the answer?). Mind you, drinking enough to have a hangover afterwards is a pretty bad idea in its own right.	2015-07-24 10:32:02Z	Lucky
1685	As for "bad idea", I was thinking toxic effects on an already overworked liver.	2015-07-24 12:53:17Z	
1685	I'm mostly curious as to the difference between painkillers and how our bodies absorb and use them (if there are differences between them) the liver thing was an example of why one might not use a particular painkiller for a particular kind of pain.	2015-07-24 12:54:48Z	
1685	Each is a broad question, so both are definitely impossible to answer in one post. Toxicity does depend on metabolic pathways and concomitant use of other substances, but it also depends on the chemical structure of each drug and its potential to react with the structures in hepatic cells. On the other hand, when taken, all medicines go through these stages Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion which are all inter-related. One could, say, construct an answer describing the pathways of two medication from you example. I might, but not today; perhaps someone else will pick it up before me	2015-07-24 13:05:16Z	Lucky

1652	I don't have an answer but can share my personal experience. I'm also a CS researcher and I had dry eyes which caused a burning sensation in eyes. I think dry eyes can be with any computer type. It was mainly due to reduced blinking rate. Doctor advised me to take regular breaks, blink at a normal rate and look out of my window to the farthest object I can see. Also, he said that air conditioner promotes drying so advised to keep a bowl of water near my PC. I had to use artificial tears for some time but now the problem is gone.

1609	My first thought is that at the very least a study into this needs to correct for number of children - having more children is correlated with a lower risk of breast cancer, while being on contraception is of course correlated with having less children. So that might lead to women on contraception seeming to have more breast cancer, while actually, it's not because of the pill itself.	2015-10-18 13:45:55Z	YviDe
1607	Can you please give a link to the original text? Just the words "trial treatment" could perhaps imply that this is a treatment given as a part of a clinical trial - but in the sentence you quoted it doesn't make much sense to me. Maybe if I read a few sentences before and/or after that one it would help.	2015-07-19 16:23:04Z	Lucky
1607	I've tried to do a Google search on the sentence you quoted and even tried to add the key words "herbal remedy", but I couldn't find this particular construction (not even when I accepted Google's suggestion for typos correction). If this is not an article from the internet can you please quote let's say two sentences before and two after that one (with the sentence in question in bold perhaps). Or, if it is from the internet, a link would be great :-).	2015-07-20 11:41:08Z	Lucky

1595	UPDATE       So it turns out I was actually misdiagnosed, I am a in fact a type 1 diabetic. I only found out after my health kept going down even with Metformin and dieting. I am the only person in my family to have been diagnosed. Thank you for all the suggestions, now that I am on proper insulin treatment, things are getting a lot better.	2017-05-05 15:39:59Z	
1589	I think the word you are looking for for "chest side down" is "prone", and the word for "chest side up" is "supine."  A good discussion of the two words is here: dailywritingtips.com/prone-vs-supine	2015-07-18 10:32:28Z	whitebeard
1589	I don't know about any possible harm, but humans do have special spines.  Almost all mammals have spines adapted for horizontal posture, where humans have spines (sort of) adapted for a vertical posture.	2016-01-08 05:09:46Z	Mark
1587	Naturally it often goes in the opposite direction, bacteria "want" to be more virulent (cause disease more easily). This can be done by transferring genetic information among them. You might find this interesting: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith%27s_experiment.	2015-07-16 23:30:51Z	Lucky
1587	Couldn't they instead become more commensalic or symbiotic?	2015-07-16 23:38:32Z	
1587	To be honest, I don't know for sure. But my reasoning is this: evolution is about the survival of the fittest. And in bacterial species where some strains are virulent/pathogenic the most tough bacteria are usually the ones that make you sick (because it's not easy to kill them, they overpopulate the host, so to speak). If you used antimicrobial agents (such as antibiotics) - the resistant ones would prevail. On the other hand, there are extremophile bacteria that are quite tough, and are not pathogenic. All in all this is a very interesting question.	2015-07-16 23:56:16Z	Lucky
1587	Well definitely bacteria want to be more virulent. But they don't want to kill their host( at least not so fast) that's why the most successful bacteria infects nearly every human, but do not cause disease. So they can spread more , not trigger immune defense and we don't research how to kill them. HIV is a example of top of my head of a virus that is getting weaker and less lethal	2015-07-16 23:57:14Z	Freedo
1587	I guess we could surround ourselves by human cell cultures that microbes will then find easier to infect than the cells in our bodies. Farmers use a similar technique: by planting weed near to crops they make the pests go to the weed. Insects like weed better than crop, also by using pesticides selectively on crops the weed will become a lot more attractive, you only need a small amount of pesticides, resistance is less likely to develop.	2015-07-17 18:42:50Z	Count Iblis

1572	Telling us which medications you're on, and what quantity of actual lemon juice you're drinking in a 24 hour period will help you get a better answer.

1564	I am no expert on the matter, but it is generally considered that "this works for me it will work for you too" approach is not a good one. The pain can be similar but originate from different conditions. Different conditions may require different exercises. If it is possible, it would be best to consult a physiatrist and/or a physiotherapist. There are some types of gentle stretching that are generally safe and don't improve the posture much, but do relax the paravertebral muscles; however, whether those you got are good for you is impossible to tell without seeing both the exercises and you.	2015-07-15 11:52:45Z	Lucky
1564	Old age isn't really a health condition nor does it cause back pain. I assume that you mean that you have back pain and are getting older and wonder what you can do to help your back. Scoliosis is a specific condition, and while stretching may be beneficial for you your question is not clear and does not lend it's self to an answer. You should probably see a professional about your back pain, but the question's false assumptions and lack of clarity prevent quality answers. You could ask about Spondylosis (common degeneration in the elderly) and how it compares to Scoliosis.	2015-11-25 02:26:45Z	Dr. Duncan
1564	@Dr.Duncan i see. The health condition that i am currently experiencing is scoliosis, and I am only 17 years old. According to my mother's boss, he suggested that I use the korean wood exercise to improve my condition, at least to ease the pain. Have you heard of such tools?	2015-11-25 02:32:24Z	
1564	I would recommend following the advice of doctors, not your mother's boss.	2017-11-29 02:10:06Z	Carey Gregory
1540	I am no doctor, but although I did some research about this topic some time ago, I did never really find out about clear and early symptoms. If I was you, I'd better visit my physician and ask him/her for a blood test.	2015-07-13 19:26:42Z	Byte Commander

1530	There are also pince-nez glasses.  Better yet, try sport glasses that have an elastic headband -- you could perhaps put the elastic headband across your ears, which would decrease the pressure on your scalp.  Or take some old glasses, remove the over-the-ear frames, and attach an elastic loop to each side, then put the loops over-and-around your ears.  That would probably press on a different part of your scalp.	2015-07-12 06:41:56Z	Iron Pillow

1530	I have been wearing new glasses since two months ago.  I specifically picked out some frames that would not press against my head, but go along with it.  The aforementioned headaches are no more!  The glasses don't sit as tightly anymore (obviously I'd say), but that's a trade-off I'm willing to make.  (Now I have a new 'problem': one glass is much closer to my eyes than the other glass.  Glasses are complicated.)	2016-08-17 07:28:01Z

1524	If you need bi-annual cleanings, then that in itself suggests that you are not cleaning your teeth very well.	2015-07-11 16:23:14Z	Count Iblis
1524	@CountIblis A bit off topic, but if you don't want to do it bi-annually, that's fine, but note that most professionals think even if you clean your teeth perfectly on a daily basis, you will have plaque after 6 months.  Also, with national insurance, it only costs me USD$3 to get a cleaning, so I choose to play it safe...	2015-07-12 13:36:37Z	
1524	@kfmfe04 just a little clarification: Biofilm and plaque start accumulating almost immediately after a cleaning, but that can be controlled by flossing and brushing. Visits to the dentist are necessary, because some of the plaque becomes tarter/calculus, and cannot be removed by the patient.	2015-11-28 10:15:58Z	enap_mwf

1512	Physiologic nicotine withdrawal only lasts a few weeks.  The behavioral and psychological addiction lasts much longer.  Even so, it is much more likely that you had depression while you were smoking (and were self-treating with nicotine).  Smoking cessation is a very poor explanation for depression.  You should consider speaking to a health professional about your symptoms.	2015-07-11 00:41:29Z	scottb
1512	Maybe i should add that i actually did smoked one or two roll-your-owns every month.	2015-07-12 20:18:39Z	
1512	Yes please. Are those one or two cigarettes per month the total amount you smoked? Also, how long did you smoke before you quit?  Length and intensity of withdrawal symptoms can be partially dependent on how much and how often you smoked, so that information would be helpful. I'll wait to hear from you. Congrats on your first anniversary! You're strong and brave, and a great example for others! Give yourself a big reward :)	2015-07-12 21:51:05Z	Sue

1512	Thanks for the information. It will help me, or anyone else, give you a better answer.

1504	Good question but one little semantic quibble: I don't think microbes can develop resistance to vaccines per se since vaccines don't affect microbes directly.	2015-07-10 05:36:18Z	Carey Gregory
1504	Microbes can definitely develop resistance to vaccines.  It happens every year with the currently available flu vaccines.	2015-07-11 00:57:10Z	scottb
1504	@scottb As I said, it's a semantic thing. Microbes don't develop resistance to vaccines, they mutate and escape detection by the immune system. That's not "resistance" to a vaccine as the word is commonly understood.	2015-07-11 05:31:14Z	Carey Gregory
1504	@CareyGregory: I'm more curious about why you believe it's worth quibbling over.  Both the NIH and CDC websites recognize and acknowledge the phenomenon of "vaccine resistance."	2015-07-11 06:14:35Z	scottb
1503	My guess is that the preworkout powder contains an ingestible nitric oxide donor (NO) or substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS).  NO is a physiologically occurring molecule with a panoply of physiologic effects both beneficial and harmful.  NO is the most potent vasodilating substance known (massive NO release is the cause for hemodynamic shock in severe bacterial sepsis).  When used during exercise, the idea is that boosting NO production will increase blood flow to muscles, thereby enhancing their recovery and development.  Nitrates are also NO donors, hence the caution.	2015-07-10 01:59:18Z	scottb

1487	No, it's not obvious that if you fast your blood sugar will be low. Someone with uncontrolled diabetes may very well have a high blood sugar level despite fasting. And if you eat a big plate of pasta before your test, how do you propose that they distinguish between a normal high reading because of your meal and a sugar metabolism problem? Like all scientific tests, it's crucial that confounding factors are controlled.	2015-07-08 15:06:43Z	Carey Gregory
1487	I see. The equilibrium glucose is what identifies diabetes or not. It makes sense :) But as @rumtscho mentioned, it would also be important to check the actual average levels, because if someone has a diet so horrendous that raises him to diabetic levels of sugar on daily basis, even without the disease, that is equally bad for him.	2015-07-08 19:19:32Z	
1480	A cold is an infection itself, so when you say "infection" do you mean bacterial infection? Or do you mean a lung infection in general, which can be viral or bacterial, such as in viral pneumonia?	2015-07-08 00:03:54Z	Carey Gregory
1480	I mean bacterial, that will require antibiotics	2015-07-08 00:45:24Z	
1480	Many have this theory (myself included) - but I have no evidence to back it up (if I wind some, I'll post an answer). The only 100% certain way to tell if you have bacteria (and which) is to do microbiological tests of the sputum or of a swab, which of course implies a visit to the doctor's. If you don't get a better answer - anything that makes you really suffer, or last longer than a few days deserves physician's attention. If it's too difficult for you to go there (the office is far away or it would cause you to loose days from work) is there an option to consult with your doctor by phone?	2015-07-09 12:41:34Z	Lucky
1474	I do 8-10h each day for over 15 years and I'm fine. so track the problem somewhere else (like what you eat or what you do). Do hair tissue mineral analysis for metal heavy metal poisoning and start from there, this usually gives clouded mind thinking.	2015-07-16 09:30:36Z	kenorb
1474	Are you idle for 15 years?	2015-07-16 12:23:46Z	
1474	Not sure what do you mean idle. You have to do something if you're sitting in front of the computer, otherwise it's more sense to sit in front of the wall which would be fairly the similar. There are many reasons, but not sitting it-self. For instance, my friend had clouded mind and not clear thinking, because of some dental problems.	2015-07-16 12:58:16Z	kenorb
1474	Doing nothing. Or Browsing for nothing. nothing comes in mind. Nothing goes. Facebook if open that is nothing, scrolling and scrolling, means nothing in the mind. changing firefox tabs from one tab and write google.com and then nothing. open another firefox and open google.com again then another tab opnen and facebook .com or something.com and when homepage load do nothing. mean clueless opening and idle man opening or devils opening or you can say nothing.	2015-07-16 13:01:02Z	
1474	Then try changing your life, work or profession. You could  also have hormone imbalance, so try 5-HTP (made from seeds) to trick your brain into producing more serotonin and see if that helps for you.	2015-07-17 10:00:33Z	kenorb

1426	Considering that drinking large amounts of water in a short period of time has resulted in numerous fatalities due to water intoxication, it's an unlikely subject for research.	2015-07-04 05:35:06Z	Carey Gregory
1426	@CareyGregory, perhaps we could study this in animals.	2015-07-04 14:54:16Z	
1426	Understood, but this isn't basic science -- it's clinical research and you're going to be harming, perhaps killing, lab animals. That's a higher standard to meet for research funding and ethics committee approval. I think you would need some supporting science since the hypothesis flies in the face of what we know about the renal system.	2015-07-04 15:45:19Z	Carey Gregory

1413	I updated my question.  I would say that it's almost certainly not gaps because when I wear nothing at all, I don't experience anything like this.  It's as if the earmuffs themselves are somehow creating the problem.	2015-06-29 03:17:29Z

1401	You are just thinking about flouride?  Think about all of the bacteria you have just scrubbed off your teeth.  Do you want to digest all that stuff or do you want to rinse it and spit it out?	2015-06-27 23:57:34Z	Kenshin
1401	@NinjaDoc - You swallow approximately a liter of saliva a day. That liter contains approximately 100 billion microbes. Brushing your teeth is more to remove surface bacteria/plaque that produce the acids causing tooth decay. Rinsing and spitting to get rid of the toothpaste is a good idea, but it's not really related to digesting a bit of extra bacteria,.	2015-06-28 03:38:54Z	JohnP
1401	@NinjaDoc That's what I thought, but if you google around you'll find several sources suggesting that rinsing with water right after brushing is not a god idea.	2015-06-28 08:03:00Z	
1401	@JohnP Why is it a good idea to rinse and spit to get rid of the toothpaste, then?	2015-06-28 08:04:11Z

1394	Yes, I mean they will crack and break, and some materials will release toxins at those temperatures. I don't know about the material you're asking about specifically, but I do know that if they can release toxins those sorts of temps will do it. Why you choose to break plates instead of washing a pan is mystifying to me.

1393	"Anyone can have a number of undiagnosed diseases."  Absolutely true.  And bad outcomes occur when no one stops to think about the possibilities.  We screen high school athletes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is rare.  The military screens every recruit for sickle trait, to avoid the small number of sudden deaths it causes during exertion.  This site takes cavalier liberties with people's health that it shouldn't.

I found that switching to white-lettering on a black-background eliminated the pain.  This was a big surprise to me, because the light from a monitor is surely less than the light outdoors.  So I tried several times to go back to the normal display, but it always caused pain recurrence, and switching back to a black background always cured the pain.  This was a black-and-white display.	2015-06-27 19:48:19Z	Iron Pillow

1337	I am genuinely intrigued. I have removed nails from people - roofers, carpenters, people playing with nail guns, even people who couldn't pull a nail out of their foot after stepping on it - and sometimes the nails have been in place for several hours or longer. Not once have I thought to order an iron level. Most iron toxicity comes from ingestion of vitamins with iron (especially in children). Are you sure about your story? How long was that nail in her body?	2015-06-22 02:54:17Z	anongoodnurse
1337	Nail was in her body for max like 2 hours . Is it hemochromatosis? Iron overload.	2015-06-22 02:59:21Z

1296	Why would a study of high fluoride concentrations in water be relevant to people who drink the low concentration of fluoride in tap water?	2015-06-22 03:15:13Z	Iron Pillow
1296	@IronPillow, I am asking about people who drink high concentrations of flouride not low concentrations in tap water.  I'd imagine my question won't be relevent to the people you are referring, but why would that matter???	2015-06-22 07:51:07Z	
1296	Now I am confused.  Are you asking about tap water fluoride, or are you asking about situations of ingesting water with a higher concentration of fluoride?  (What would that be?)  Or are you referring to the range of fluoride concentration in tap water and the effects of concentrations that like at the higher end of the spectrum?	2015-06-23 16:41:58Z	Iron Pillow
1296	@IronPillow, Think of it as this:  If i were the government, how much fluoride can I add to the water before it will start to negatively affect IQ.  Alternatively think of it as in some countries the dam water is contaminated by natural flouride from neighbouring rocks.  At what concentrations (if any) will it start to negatively affect IQ.	2015-06-24 08:23:23Z	
1296	This is a much clearer question.  However, I seriously doubt it can be answered with any kind of scientific rigor.  It does not lend itself to randomization (one would have to randomize entire water districts) and it would require a decade of follow-up, and one would have to account for people moving into and out of a water district.  Tough.  Observational studies would have zillions of contaminating correlates.  As far as I know, IQ is not defined in animals, so animal studies would not work, although surrogate measures of intelligence could perhaps be employed.	2015-06-27 19:16:33Z	Iron Pillow

1285	That it's banned it's not a good answer, even if it were true (for what's its worth, it hasn't been banned in any country.) Linking it to obesity because it makes food taste better is as meaningful as saying that cinnamon leads to obesity because them rolls are yummy. High sodium content can be found on salt, also not banned. I have yet to see a good, meaningful study saying it's dangerous when eaten in normal consumption levels (of course it can be dangerous, you could drown if you fall into a pool filled with it.)	2015-06-22 18:42:42Z	Leonardo Herrera

1284	Super size me is irrelevant to the question. It was undertaken by somebody who, on purpose, restricted his diet to the menu sizes and upsell suggestions created by McDonald's.

1284	Diet is a matter greater than weight maintenance. Eating fast food daily is one of the worst things you can do to your health. That was my experience and that's what nutritionists say, they advise eating it once a year at most. Nutrition is key to your health, and fast food has very little nutritional value, so it's an inefficient use of caloric intake. Not to mention the effects it has on your arteries, bowels, plus all the chemical additives, etc. I wouldn't make weight the most important factor in determining a proper diet.	2015-06-21 13:15:51Z	sss4r

1263	I'm a bit at a loss: what kind of answer do you expect to your question? People obviously don't have enough evidence to classify it as "something will likely happen" because else it would have been banned, not gotten a warning. People don't have enough evidence to classify it as "we are sure nothing will happen" because else they wouldn't be plastering a warning. So the warning itself tells you "nobody knows if there is a risk". What more do you expect to hear?	2015-06-16 14:33:15Z	rumtscho
1263	Okay, I'll try to explain it better. According to Wikipedia the "Proposition 65 is formally titled 'The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986'.", which makes me wonder that only products that I might somehow ingest, or that might be in touch with something that I'll eat later, are harmful regarding to the prop 65. (because of the Safe Drinking Water part)  So if I just have contact with the luggage, not ingesting anything that had contact with, will it be safe?  If there is anything else that I can clarify, please let me know. And thanks for trying to help. :)	2015-06-17 02:47:44Z	
1263	Your luggage may contain nothing harmful at all.  In many cases, the Proposition 65 warning is an incantation used to ward off lawyers rather than a warning of hazards: see, for example, the appellate court opinion in *Consumer Defense Group v. Rental housing industry members -- the alleged carcinogens were automobile exhaust fumes from cars in parking lots, and the possibility that someone on the grounds of the apartment buildings might be smoking a cigarette.	2015-06-18 01:02:27Z	Mark
1263	Hmmm, that makes sense and also remove many of my fears. Thank you @Mark! Do you want post it as an answer so I can accept it? :)	2015-06-18 23:16:38Z	
1262	Clarification - Is marijuana legal where you live? If not, legal is always a recourse.	2015-06-16 02:43:52Z	JohnP
1262	Thanks for your comment. I'm not aware of current marijuana law in my state of Georgia. Even then, it takes the police too long to arrive, and, even if they arrived in time, I think it would be difficult for them to get a warrant.	2015-06-16 03:11:55Z	
1262	On a personal level, your situation is indeed a confounded one, I'm sorry to hear that you have to deal with it. On a site policy level, I'm not sure we can help you. "How likely" is not very answerable even for a single potential outcome counted over a vast majority of "standard" people. But you are asking about any possible outcome, and that for a person who is unusually sensitive and so large epidemiological results are probably not generalizable. Second and related, the question is too close to personal health advice and I don't see how to remove that and still have it applicable (cont.)	2015-06-16 14:39:32Z	rumtscho
1262	(cont.) to your situation. Third, you are taking a logical leap here. You could be sensitive to something else in the apartment - mold, formaldehyde treated furniture, whatever. You provided a laundry list of symptoms, but there is no certainty it's really a pot connection, especially seeing that marijuana and especially nicotine are generally good for depression, so unlikely to cause it. So I cast a close vote - while your concern is warranted, I don't see how we could help, and I think this is not the type of question this site can do well with.	2015-06-16 14:43:01Z	rumtscho

1258	it is quite common in Sinophere countries (but even in some Western ones) back in ancient time that people did this practice. People who was cut of his penis was called Eunuch. After being cut, they had to avoid eating or drinking (at least in three days) to heal the urethra. And sure, they (mostly) survived	2015-06-15 16:04:59Z	Ooker
1258	@Ooker - This sounds like an answer to me! Would you consider fleshing it out a bit and posting? :-)	2015-06-15 20:19:25Z	anongoodnurse
1258	@anongoodnurse but I can only give historical information. Those Eunuch actually got cared after the removal. I don't know what happens "if a person without knowledge and tools cuts off somebody's penis and then doesn't call an ambulance immediately", quote the OP	2015-06-16 05:48:37Z	Ooker
1258	@Ooker - A slight misconception. A eunuch is someone that has had their testicles removed, not the penis. It was done primarily to ensure a place in certain societies, such as harem guards, treble (high pitch) male singers, etc., or as punishment for certain crimes.	2015-06-16 16:28:00Z	JohnP
1258	@Ooker - That may be true, but the main goal of creating a eunuch was to remove the testicles to prevent sex hormones creating changes or preventing sexual urges. Some may have also removed the penis, but that would mostly be irrelevant in the intent of the procedure.	2015-06-17 14:22:09Z	JohnP

1247	Aside: extra sugar calories, as in added sugar? There is milk without added sugar. And if the children don't like milk, how about yoghurt or cheese? Or egg yolks, legumes, nuts... It's not about taking a lot of one sort of food that contains a certain nutrient, but about balanced nutrition. Calcium isn't important just for height, but for bone density (and other things, but let's stick to bones for now). Once the susceptibility to fractures is there the problem has already started and is more difficult to reverse than prevent.	2015-06-15 19:10:38Z	Lucky
1247	I mean the calories from the lactose in the milk. But the bigger problem is that my kids just don't like dairy products enough to get enough calcium that way. But I've read that some people are questioning whether dietary calcium is actually needed in that quantity for optimal bone health, and since Paleo people didn't consume dairy, maybe that is correct.	2015-06-15 21:03:23Z	
1247	I think our ancestors got calcium from fruit and animal bones. Though maybe centuries of increasing dependence on cattle milk made our bone structure favor calcium more.	2015-06-16 09:50:02Z	jiggunjer

1223	The fact that it only happens sometimes means there's a variable (which could be anything). Try looking at all the variables: water temperature, water source (does it happen at the gym? after swimming?) the towel you use (fresh? What kind of fiber?), etc. etc. Eventually you'll narrow something down which will make this question easier to answer with facts.	2015-06-11 19:04:18Z	anongoodnurse
1223	I can rule out gym/swimming, and generally the water temperature is the same (warm and not too hot). The towel material could be a variable, as well as the detergent used to wash it, but again these don't vary. Drip-drying could be a useful experiment I suppose.	2015-06-12 17:03:00Z

1221	@CareyGregory in all my readings done by a professional, my systolic was in the 100 to 120 range. I've had 63 for diastolic before, but that's slightly on the low side for me. The meds were prednisolone, and AFAIK hormones act quickly.	2015-08-16 11:31:48Z

1214	Hello George! Not even the best doctors can diagnose somebody over the Internet, sight unseen. No matter how many symptoms you describe, the person has to go to a health care professional. I think only the third of your four points is clearly on-topic. Maybe the fourth one can be asked on its own, starting out from the assumption of a real infection, but the "tactful prevention" is not something I'd expect a health professional would have advice for. The first two are unanswerable, however.	2015-06-10 21:14:38Z	rumtscho
1214	Thanks. I have removed the other questions to try and make my question more on-topic. This is probably the most important question	2015-06-10 21:16:56Z	
1209	I voted to close. There are hundreds of natural moisturizers and hundreds of industrial moisturizers, and possibly a lot which fall in between (moisturizing mixtures produced by commercial entities in the organic branche). I doubt that there is a single health effect which all natural ones have in common but all industrial ones don't have, and vice versa. There is no way to make a meaningful comparison.	2015-06-10 13:49:47Z	rumtscho
1209	What if I don't count what fall in between?	2015-06-10 14:48:24Z	
1209	I only mentioned the in-between ones to show you that the categories don't have a real definition. You'd need a criterion for deciding what's on one side, or the other, or in-between (it's more of a fluid spectrum). But that's less relevant. The main point is that even the ones on both sides have nothing in common, health-wise. There are more differences between the single products in each category than between the two categories. So there are no health related statements which can be made about the distinction of the two categories.	2015-06-10 14:58:35Z	rumtscho
1209	sorry, I'm not sure that I understand you correctly. In your first comment: " I doubt that there is a single health effect which all natural ones have in common but all industrial ones don't have, and vice versa" ~> This is what I'm looking for. If it don't exist, just say it. It doesn't relate to the broadness of the question. In your second one: " the categories don't have a real definition" ~> no? For me, it's clear as crystal since we agree that the products fall in between are not be counted. Can you explain more?	2015-06-10 17:31:06Z	
1209	I know of no crystal clear definition of "natural". What makes you put olive oil in the natural category and vaseline in the unnatural one, for example? And whatever this criterion is, is it applicable to all other examples you can come up with?	2015-06-10 20:46:37Z	rumtscho
1207	Welcome to the site! Have you seen a doctor? AC joint injuries, while not uncommon, can cause extensive damage, which often worsens over time. X-rays and/or other tests are vital for early and accurate diagnosis, and to put a treatment plan in place. A period of immobility may be required, and any boxing at all may be making it worse. While I'd like to help you, my personal opinion is that you should seek medical care. Someone here may disagree with me, though, and offer some good advice. I hope you feel better soon!	2015-06-14 20:55:36Z	Sue

1207	@Sue, the doctor's examination stated: severe arthritis on the AC-joint. Pain can be suppressed with anti-inflamation and painkillers, or even cortisone injections. In the long run, it could be advised to get the joint removed. But for now on, I can carefully restart training and do more stability exercises.	2015-07-31 10:27:25Z	
1207	@c0s1n3, steroid injections weaken the tissues around the injection (tendons, ligaments), so repeated injections increase the risk of tendon rupture. Also, I believe arthritis that resulted from an injury, can heal optimally with rest, not with training.	2016-10-05 18:49:49Z	Jan

1198	Interesting question, but I can't imagine that any amount of ethanol can be healthy for a developing brain, as it's a neurotoxine. Unfortunately I can't proof this with anything, but the actions you describe - even if that very small amount would not be toxic yet - are preparing the children to drink more alcohol when growing up. Once they got the taste, it's likely that they will abuse alcohol at an early teen age, where it is very unhealthy and brain-damaging.	2015-07-13 19:55:21Z	Byte Commander

1198	@JohnP: I am interested in the brain development impact, and you are welcome to offer an Answer. The research you cited in your post is for rats with a BAC of 204 mg/dl. That dosage is so high, I'm not surprised that even one day caused harm, and that's why I discounted the study. Would 0.2g/kg/day (not 2.5g/kg/day) still cause harm, or can the body metabolize the alcohol before it causes damage? That's the real question.	2015-07-15 01:15:25Z

1190	I think that this question (and probably your approach to designing this app) should be redefined. Diabetes is a very serious condition. There is no way that an app can replace consultations with a doctor! This would be very dangerous. You could design an app that would help patients keep track of their routine, progress, therapy etc. which they could use when they consult with their doctor to answer the doctor's questions e.g. But a phone can't replace a doctor, no matter how "smart" it is.	2015-06-08 21:42:52Z	Lucky
1190	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question needs reframing. Instead of asking about an app, ask about what are the basic parameters a diabetic need to monitor, and then it can be fit better to the website.	2015-06-09 05:35:40Z	Rana Prathap
1190	I am voting to close because even if the question is considered on topic, it's simply too broad. This (finding out what info needs to go into an application) is my day job, and it takes hundreds of hours of talking to users and other stakeholders. It is not possible to be answered in a Stack Exchange website.

1189	As this article from Stritch School of Medicine explains, one of the main goals of general anaesthesia is amnesia, but not retrograde amnesia, which is what I think you're thinking of.

1178	In some health systems, your general practitioner refers you to a specialist and then: a) the specialist prescribes the medication or b) the specialist writes a report, based on which your GP prescribes the medication. The reason your GP refused to prescribe it might be because they are afraid to do you harm if you don't get specialist's attention; in some countries it is prohibited by law for them to prescribe certain classes of medicines. The question is does your healthcare system (insurance) cover this type of medicines for this indication. That's where you should start your search IMO.	2015-06-07 22:42:57Z	Lucky
1178	I put my location in the post, I forgot initially. And yes, I've looked up whether my insurance covers it, and it does.	2015-06-07 23:46:20Z	
1178	Unfortunately, all I know (or think I know) is that healthcare financing in the US is insurance based and that insurance is private (not state-owned), but I'm not familiar with the details how it works. It's a great question (and might interest people with a similar problem with any kind of medication that needs to prescribed by a specialist). We should ask @anongoodnurse for help with the tags and perhaps with the answer as well :-). Best of luck ;-)!	2015-06-08 00:24:38Z	Lucky
1171	Solution for what? Are you asking for alternate treatments for vitiligo (if so, she really should look into UV therapy, it worked wonders for my sister) for alternate ways of protecting herself from the sun or for alternate moisturizing creams? Please edit and clarify.	2015-06-07 19:10:57Z	terdon
1171	Done @terdon. TIA.	2015-06-07 19:15:48Z	
1171	Thanks, that's clearer. It would be even better if you could explain precisely why the products she uses aren't good enough. As it stands, you are basically asking for a list of alternatives. Could you narrow it down and specify precisely what she would need that her current creams don't offer? On a side note, if she hasn't looked into UV therapy, she really should ask her doctor about it. I couldn't believe the difference it made for my sister who also has a pretty serious case of Vitiligo. Not 80%, perhaps, but certainly ~50%. UV is the only thing we've seen that was able to reduce it.	2015-06-07 22:48:55Z	terdon
1167	Hello, it seems that you are asking two separate questions here. Your title is asking if you can overdose on nicotine from cigarettes. In the body it asks  how much.

How many cigarettes would one have to smoke to reach this point?" or something similar. Thanks	2015-06-06 20:10:59Z	michaelpri
1166	Not my field but I think it depends on the type of cancer.

1162	This is a very interesting question.

1162	@anongoodnurse I edited the question to be more clear	2015-06-07 06:46:56Z	
1162	A doctor cannot give them medicines to protect them that way. Antibiotics are not perfect. You cannot deliver antimycotics everywhere in the body. And there are viruses which are not very problematic for somebody with an intact immune system (herpes, epstein-barr) which will probably overtake somebody whose immune system is 100% destroyed. And then there are our own mutated cells which our immune system tries to destroy to prevent cancer - in the 80s, one of the first signs that there is an epidemic of an immunodeficiency disease was a type of cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma.	2015-06-07 08:52:38Z	rumtscho
1162	Aside from that, you can heal AIDS with a bone marrow transplant, which makes me think that the virus also hides in the stem cells of the immune system, not only the mature ones. But I don't know enough on the subject to write an answer. You can research the bone marrow healing yourself, it made a lot of headlines a year or two ago.	2015-06-07 09:03:15Z	rumtscho
1159	This question might be improved (and maybe get an answer) if you asked one question instead of several. Might you be willing to edit?	2015-09-27 19:42:26Z	anongoodnurse
1159	Yes, there's three questions in here that would make good separate questions, but together it's a lot to cover in just one answer.	2015-11-26 17:29:38Z	YviDe
1155	what is a "salt room"?	2015-06-04 15:54:45Z	rumtscho
1155	It is a room full of alt aerosol which penetrates your nasal and respiratory passageways. image of a salt room myautisticmuslimchild.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/…	2015-06-04 16:24:28Z	
1154	I find this YouTube clip about immunology in the skin, from Nature.	2015-06-04 23:08:34Z	
1154	-1 for quoting Hippocrates. Was a good laugh though.	2015-06-05 14:22:36Z	jiggunjer
1154	@jiggunjer are you serious? Come on, what's wrong with that? He did say that, didn't he?	2015-06-05 14:28:09Z	
1154	While that is attributed to him, quoting 3000 year old medical knowledge is not scientific best practice.	2015-06-05 14:29:41Z	jiggunjer
1154	well, I agree that 3000 year old knowledge is not best practice. But the purpose I wrote that because I just want to make some fun. It works doesn't it? The explanation in that link is based on modern knowledge although. And because I'm not sure about that so that's the reason I put it here.	2015-06-05 14:57:50Z	
1150	Did you try reading what honey consists of...	2015-06-04 09:10:53Z	jiggunjer
1140	Hi there! I think this may not be the right place because it doesn't seem to be about health, but rather discussion on the cost of tests. Unfortunately, opendata.SE would probably still be a better place for your question. Did you consider putting a bounty to draw more attention to your question? Best of luck!	2015-06-03 18:32:07Z	Dave Liu
1140	Statistics courses aimed at biologists or medics will frequently use examples from real studies when introducing ROC curves. You could probably look through textbooks and courses (maybe look at MOOC platforms?) and thus find out the validity of some tests. Utility may be mentioned there, or more likely in papers which introduced or reviewed the tests (which should be easy to find once you have leads). The cost will have to come from somewhere else, though. Maybe from public information on how much an insurance have to pay the doctors for the test.	2015-06-03 18:44:49Z	rumtscho
1140	Rather than validity, I think the technical terms are sensitivity(how many false negatives) and specificity(how many false positives). Try searching for breast cancer screening or HPV screening tests.	2015-06-04 09:24:48Z	jiggunjer
1140	Would The Validity and Utility of Selection Methods in Personnel Psychology help? It's old and it's about HR psychology as I can see, but there is a table with quantitative values for validity...	2015-06-05 02:52:13Z	Lucky
1140	I accidentally came across a paper discussing tests for one specific condition, it is of course not as convenient as having a table, but at least it is one example. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20828509	2015-06-07 19:11:16Z	rumtscho
1133	@DaveL: thanks for your edit. However why do you put the image into a link instead of showing it directly? I think it will be easier for the readers to see it?	2015-06-03 15:59:30Z	
1133	Oh, that was a mistake. I didn't notice that changed. Thanks for pointing that out. Actually, now that I consider it, the picture isn't all that relevant and does take up a lot of space. Someone who's trying to answer the question wouldn't find that image useful.	2015-06-03 16:01:20Z	Dave Liu
1130	Another interesting question would be why aren't vaccines given shortly after exposure? I'm guessing the reason is the prevent overburdening the immune system. Adding a vaccine after infection would cause inhibitive competition with antibodies.	2016-03-24 02:33:30Z	jiggunjer
1128	One of the claims I've heard is that with a varied diet you will naturally correct imbalances by craving food that is rich in whatever you have a shortage of, whereas if you're eating one thing all the time and it's not the right mix for you there's no way to correct. I don't have any citation though so not posting this as an answer.	2015-06-03 20:53:00Z	Random832
1128	In the DIY community, that's less of an issue for the creators, as they are very much in control of the recipe. For me, that also isn't an issue, as I generally get at least one real meal a day, or more. That is a decent start to a counter point if it can get backed up. Everyone is different, so there's no miracle food, but it's still probably healthier than a lot of the diets of people who live near me...	2015-06-04 03:25:35Z	
1128	I question some of assumptions that Soylent is predicated on. One is that we know exactly what the human body needs and can just put it in a shake. But what if there are micronutrients in real food that we just haven't discovered yet? Or what if the nutrient in the shake simply doesn't work when distilled into pure form, without the natural packaging provided by, say, the apple it came from. We evolved to eat food, and assuming that we can eat a processed version may be misguided.	2015-06-08 18:12:38Z	Joshua Frank

1126	Hello Zephyrus, and welcome. As you can see, this site is not suited for addressing personal situations like this. There is no way for us to know the specifics of your background that might be relevant for making a diagnosis. Please see a medical provider if you are concerned. Thanks.	2015-06-09 13:19:33Z	Susan
1119	Common sense says dry food measurements are reflected in the nutrition labels, since that is the form it is sold in. For example how would a cornflakes producer know how much milk or yoghurt etc you use? Ideally though labels should use weight, not volume for solids.	2015-06-02 03:24:44Z	jiggunjer
1119	Though if you are logging meals you should log caloric intake, not just the amount of cups/grams/whatever of a food you eat.	2015-06-02 03:30:36Z	jiggunjer
1119	@jiggunjer Agreed on both points, but not what I'm looking for: in the app I'm using, you input how much you ate and it gives you all the calories/sugar/carbs/protein, etc.  So I just need to know how much I ate.  Which should be easy, but when I go to input Rice, I stop.  "I ate one cup of rice," I say to myself, "but that was half of the one cup of dry rice that I cooked. Did I eat one cup of rice, or half a cup of rice?" I can't figure out the carbs until I know how much I ate, and because the app is independent of the packaged food, I don't know if they're assuming cooked or uncooked.	2015-06-02 05:57:19Z	
1119	And in that situation, using weight is no different: rice gains a LOT of weight from water.  Is that "5 ounces of rice" supposed to be uncooked rice, or cooked rice?  The stats will be wildly different, because the calories-per-ounce gets skewed when the water weight is added to the equation.	2015-06-02 05:59:03Z	
1119	In that case your app documentation should mention it. Though my guess is the dry/pre-cook amount, because that data is easier available to app programmers.	2015-06-02 07:21:21Z	jiggunjer
1110	While I think there are some good questions here, by having four different questions in your post makes it very broad. To avoid having it closed for that reason, I would suggest you narrow down which question you want answered, and combine/make other question posts for the remaining.	2015-06-01 14:46:31Z	JohnP
1110	@JohnP ok, thanks, I will separate the questions.	2015-06-01 14:58:53Z

1106	You might consider including other essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals and fats in your question	2015-06-01 10:57:10Z	jiggunjer
1106	It would become "too broad" and then be closed. My question is very specific.	2015-06-01 14:11:09Z	
1106	@michaelpri I feel you don't know what you're talking about. I'm not aware of any different types of vegan diets, do you? Then, essential amino acids are essential, it's not me that I want them in my diet, everybody needs them.	2015-06-02 10:18:31Z	
1106	@Attilio - Whose vegan diet? What are the elements that you are currently consuming? Your question currently is which ones might be lacking. That would be all of them might be lacking. We would need a 3-5 day sample intake to assess anything. And, as jiggunjer points out, there are many elements besides amino acids that might be lacking in a vegan diet. This currently is a very broad, generic question.	2015-06-02 16:53:38Z	JohnP
1099	I seriously doubt digestive fiber can "disappear" with blending. Does this mean flax seeds lose their health properties when ground?	2016-08-04 07:29:03Z	Lou
1098	The capsules are definitely not made of plastic. If not gelatine, they are probably HPMC capsules (made of a cellulose derivative) or something similar. Although solid dosage forms are the most stable forms of medicines, incompatibilities are not impossible (although with coated tablets and capsules they are unlikely). But to know which medication is which and avoid mistakes you would have to pack those that you need for that day each day. I would recommend a small medicine box/pill organiser (those that are devided in several little compartments) to keep different sorts of your meds separate.	2015-06-17 12:19:58Z	Lucky
1098	Right you are about the capsules! I checked the bottles and edited the correct information into the question, which is now accurate and therefore more useful to the community. Thank you for that, and for your other suggestion as well!	2015-06-17 20:11:32Z	
1098	@Lucky - "incompatibilities are not impossible". Can you think of any examples? I'd be surprised (OP stated no liquids). If they aren't incompatible in a patient's body, why would they be incompatible in a bottle?	2015-06-17 23:36:21Z	anongoodnurse
1098	@anongoodnurse incompatibilities are unlikely, but it all depends on the composition of every medicine and the period of time during which they are all kept together. The first thing that comes to mind is an uncoated tablet that contains a hygroscopic substance in touch with a capsule (if the tablet has crumbled the surface of contact increases) - HPMC capsule wall contains 2-7% water which can be absorbed by the hygroscopic powder from another medicine. The possibility is merely theoretical but I just wanted to suggest an alternative (neater) solution for the OP	2015-06-18 01:06:19Z	Lucky
1098	@ Sue it's great question, and since there are no more plastic capsules in it, +1 from me :-). @anongoodnurse is right to challenge my claim about incompatibilities - I don't think they are likely and if there were any they probably wouldn't affect medicines' effectiveness, but I'm one of those somewhat overly-sceptic people who doubt everything that isn't proven by a specific study (I'm terrible as a patient). The picture of a bunch of different medicines rolling in one bottle just doesn't sit well with my pharmaceutical pedantry; but convenience is important if it improves compliance	2015-06-18 01:18:33Z	Lucky
1095	I'll assume the collar has a DC voltage of X volts. If the voltage is high enough a detectable current will run through your leg. This current may be higher in you than in a dog, depending on how dog skin/fur contribute to resistance. So the comparison may be flawed, you also need to account for different pain thresholds between species.	2015-05-31 07:38:36Z	jiggunjer

1093	@DriftingSteps i think you should look at my question of long term sleeping at day too. I'm still waiting someone to answer sadly :/ but i think that what is hurting you more than sleeping at day is your 6 hours of sleep only. You need to sleep at least 8 hours.

1090	Without going into your collar bone assertion, usually a wheelchair, to be honest. Before wheelchairs, bedrest was common. And now you've got me curious as to what injury mechanism would cause both a broken collar bone and leg, but it's your story! :-)	2015-05-29 14:54:17Z	anongoodnurse
1090	if you have him break his ankle, he can use a crutch that straps on to your knee - you kneel on it basically and walk like a peg-leg but with the lower leg sticking out behind you.	2015-05-29 20:22:42Z	Kate Gregory
1090	I edited your title and question, as you reference the arm and leg, but state that he breaks his collarbone. If this is incorrect, the edit can be rolled back.	2015-05-29 20:44:29Z	JohnP
1090	@anongoodnurse - That's what happens when you get diagonal train tracks across the road at 53 mph on a road bike. :) I still have several road rash scars left over from that. :| (I was not the broken bone sufferer).	2015-05-29 23:13:54Z	JohnP
1090	Having been there, I agree that bedrest, followed by a wheelchair, then a walker, may be the best course of action.  A kind caretaker, who you can literally lean on, is invaluable. The way the bones are set-sling, cast, position, etc. are also determining factors when making a treatment plan.	2015-05-30 19:21:54Z	Sue
1078	If they could find the bug in your blood now you would still be very sick... Basically it depends on the sort and the severity of poisoning, that is the effects it had on your body - some cases might show changes in certain biochemical parameters (e.g. liver enzyme levels) - but for how long, for what sorts of poisoning and exactly which tests - I'll leave for an MD to answer (I'm from a different field).	2015-05-30 01:19:46Z	Lucky
1076	Just checking: have you seen this case, possibly this case, this case - close and this strange case. Is this what you're asking for?	2015-05-28 06:26:45Z	anongoodnurse
1076	@anongoodnurse was going through those now. Mostly seeing elevated DHEA-S as well which is freakishly missing here along with the pt being male.  There's a chance I was going to answer this myself with a few of these.  Or maybe I should just delete the question.	2015-05-28 06:32:49Z	
1076	DHEA wasn't elevated in two of those, if I read correctly. The other two were less suitable, I agree. But they don't seem to be exceedingly rare - interestingly these were detected in women because of hirsuitism. How would they be detected in men? Aggression?	2015-05-28 06:38:12Z	anongoodnurse
1076	@anongoodnurse I completely missed that last one.  I have a habit of working through my own Q&A in Bio.SE, which maybe I should avoid here.	2015-05-28 06:39:21Z	
1076	Not at all. Makes for good questions. :-) If you're satisfied with those, I can write it up as an answer.	2015-05-28 06:43:04Z	anongoodnurse
1063	Hm....I know of know disadvantage to sleeping on the stomach in adults (actually would cure most sleep apnea if people could manage it consistently). Could you cite a source you read that was making that claim (“according to many articles”)?	2015-05-26 06:45:02Z	Susan
1063	@Susan I edited my post to include some links.  Good point about sleep apnea - someone I know with apnea has had multiple sleep studies done and had the least occurrence of apnea events when on their stomach.	2015-05-26 15:44:24Z	
1063	Thanks for adding the references! One other thing: I think there are really two questions in here: 1) Is stomach-sleeping bad? and 2) Why are people drawn to something bad? The second seems to be either a teleological or evolutionary question that might be better on (in the first case) a philosophy or religion site or (in the second case) on biology.SE. The first question, on the other hand, is eminently on-topic and answerable. Could I convince you to narrow it accordingly?	2015-05-29 11:32:58Z	Susan
1063	@Susan I guess the reason I put both in the question is I'd like to see any answer to #1 account for the fact that people seem to be drawn to stomach sleeping, even from a very young age where societal influence if anything seems to steer towards the opposite (e.g. "back is best" SIDS campaign).  I suppose I could just reply in the comments to any answer which didn't address that, but I figured might as well put it in the question itself.	2015-05-29 15:05:13Z	
1060	Your first link does not differentiate drinking water during or after a meal. The second advocates drinking water half an hour before or one hour after a meal, citing the myth of dilution of digestive juices. If you want to address drinking during a meal or dilution of digestive juices, you will  need to change the question a bit. Thanks.	2015-05-25 17:41:37Z	anongoodnurse

1055	This may be related to loss of flexibility. The problem with this is that if parts of body don't flex properly, they can put additional stress on other parts of your body.

1042	What do you mean by "the body acts"? They don't cause insulin spikes (unless you are eating sweeteners "filled" with glucose), but other hormones react as with real sugar. Also, do you consider the gut flora to be part of the acting body or not?	2015-05-22 18:51:01Z	rumtscho
1042	I understand that an insulin spike is a reaction to carbs, which have calories. Artificial sweeteners, since they have no calories, should thus cause no insulin spike, in theory.	2015-05-22 19:11:02Z	
1042	Insulin secretion is usually a reaction to carbs or fat (with the carbs causing a larger spike because of high GI) but this does not mean that it doesn't increase in other cases. Anyway, artificial sweeteners interfere with leptin signalling, I don't remember if they also do something about insulin or not. If you want to keep the question small and answerable, it's better to ask about insulin effects only. But like everything else we consume, they have tons of other effects, and the net effect on weight (which I assume you are interested in) tends to be weight gain.	2015-05-22 19:22:29Z	rumtscho

1037	Can we assume you are only considering adults and not pt that are suffering malnutrition?  BMR can drop below safe levels from poor diets (insufficient calories/time).

1037	Just to make sure we're on the same page, malnutrition can occur from simply having too few calories (including fat stores) for your given environment, regardless of sufficient vitamin intake.  Environment is also not to be ignored.  The BMR of people in Scotland is likely higher than someone in the tropics simply based on thermal regulation (a more extreme example would be to compare Antarctica).  These are all reasons why I think % reduction is more appropriate than an empirical number.	2015-05-26 20:55:25Z	Atl LED

Does it change at all? How? And a close-up would be nice as well. Finally, when you feel the spot with your index finger (other hand of course) what does it feel like? Is it elevated? Is it firmer than the skin around it? Does it feel like a "blister"? Thanks.	2015-05-20 14:13:30Z	anongoodnurse
1027	Thanks for your comment. I did what you said with the side of a glass - nothing happened. It doesn't change in shape nor does it hurt. When I feel it it is not elevated. It doesn't feel like a blister.	2015-05-21 10:43:14Z	
1027	It's really weird how it's been on my finger all these years and it has never bothered me. I am just curious to know what it is. I've checked online - could it be a Mongolian spot? I know that appears on baby bottoms, but could it also appear on a finger?	2015-05-21 10:45:11Z	
1022	Cancer itself was well known in prehistoric times, but I can't tell you anything about brain tumors specifically. Anyway, if the topic interests you, I once saw an author's presentation of this book and it seemed like a very good read: amazon.de/The-Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography/dp/1439170916.	2015-10-24 09:48:59Z	rumtscho

1009	Both sources seem reputable, I wouldn't be able to decide witch one is more so. As for the difference - the quantity of any substance produced in plants may vary according to biotic and abiotic factors (amount of rain and sunshine, type of soil etc.), or sort/variety/cultivar. Plants can even absorb thiamine produced by bacteria and fungi from the soil, and store it. I don't know if these factors can account for such a big difference (maybe someone at biology SE would know) but this is the only reason (aside from one of the websites being wrong) that I can think of.	2015-06-04 10:44:13Z	Lucky

989	Your weight loss isn't causing acne. It's likely your diet or other changed-up habits.	2015-05-15 19:22:43Z	
989	@Alec - Greasy foods do not worsen acne, that's a myth. Dairy, chocolate and some carb rich foods do, however. I think this is a better question for health, however.	2015-05-15 20:56:31Z	JohnP

973	dh47, as stated in other comments, this is something that your friend needs to seek personal medical advice for immediately. It is just not safe to rely on folks on the internet to provide care in this circumstance. If, after helping your friend obtain appropriate care, you would like to come back and re-phrase this to be a more general question about camphor, you can edit it and we can se about re-opening. Thanks.	2015-05-15 09:44:00Z	Susan
968	Do you have a need to consume unusually large quantities of water each day? Because without that context, questions asking "What if... <crazy premise>" are probably going to get down-voted on the basis of "why would you want to do that?"	2015-05-13 22:11:42Z	Robert Cartaino
968	While this isn't an especially well-researched or contextualized question, I have to say that the votes to close as either "primarily opinion based" or "unclear what you're asking" really confuse me. The literature on the consequences of excess water intake is substantial. (If interested, see my rant about the use of 'primarily opinion based' on this site.) Although "health risks" may be poorly defined, this is a case where there's basically one major risk, and the question is quite answerable. IMO.	2015-05-14 17:16:29Z	Susan
966	Do you mean besides weight loss? Can you expand on this question (what negative effects are you wondering about?) without broadening it's already maybe too (e.g. does this include psychological effects?) broad scope? How far beyond weight loss to within a standard deviation of ideal body weight do you mean? A prolonged caloric deficit would ultimately lead to death. Seemingly straightforward questions are rarely so. Please limit the scope of this question. Thanks!	2015-05-23 16:49:39Z	anongoodnurse
963	The process relevant to your question is called protein catabolism. It's relatively complex, but you might want to start by looking into that term. If it helps, proteins are composed of chains of amino acids, and typically get broken down into polypeptides (very short amino acid chains), amino acids, and proteoses and peptones, basically combinations of the two. These are further broken down into ammonia, methane, and a number of sulfer-containing compounds, among others. I hope that gives you a nice list of terms and processes to get your search started. It's a good question.	2015-05-17 23:10:12Z	TheEnvironmentalist

956	Not everyone experiences morning sickness. I would ask that you make your question a bit more specific, as it is very broad as it stands, and your title does not reflect your actual question.	2015-05-13 14:33:52Z	JohnP
956	The only reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. The others affect some but not others, and can occur at different times during each person's pregnancy.	2015-05-14 07:07:07Z	anongoodnurse
956	@anongoodnurse this sounds enough to be an answer. Yes, it is basic knowledge, but if the OP is asking the question, then it is not too basic for him. Everybody has to learn the basics somewhere, and there is no reason for us not to describe them.	2015-05-14 09:22:11Z	rumtscho

952	Welcome to Health.SE. This question seems very broad, as many things could happen when you don't sleep at all. I'm afraid that there are just too many other factors that you may fail to recognize are important and without those, we can't accurately say what would happen. If you could add in more details, this question could possibly be reopened. Thanks :)	2015-05-13 11:11:17Z	michaelpri

939	Hi Saed, and welcome to health.SE! I’m confused by this question, and the part of it I do understand («is it possible that I’m hepatitis positive?») falls into the category of personal medical advice which we can’t offer here. If you want to ask about how viral hepatitis is transmitted, you could do that. If you want to ask about the symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis, you could do that. Or you could ask about the types of symptoms that come with liver disease more generally. As it is this is some mix of those that I can’t quite make out.	2015-05-12 19:13:55Z	Susan

934	Hello, welcome to Health.SE. This seems like it could be a good question, but you are asking two questions. One about sleeping position, and one about physical activity. Could you please specify just one question? (I'm assuming you want the sleeping position instead of physical activity) Thanks :)	2015-05-11 20:16:10Z	michaelpri
934	To me, sleeping position doesn't matter at all.	2015-05-12 20:34:24Z	KingBOB
934	@michaelpri My question is mainly about Sleeping Position. The query about physical activity is secondary, for which I'll ask another question later.	2015-05-13 10:14:20Z

946	Just a clarification - Tendons connect muscle to bone, and as such don't really cramp. Are you getting foot cramps in the muscles actually in the sole of the foot, or are you getting tendon pain?	2015-05-12 21:25:24Z	JohnP
946	@JohnP, not sure if I can tell, but I believe it is in the muscles in the sole.  The third and fourth toes sometimes seem to be trying to cross over one another.  Although I guess that may only make sense to someone that has experienced the same.	2015-05-13 11:59:25Z	
946	No, it makes sense. I used to swim competitively and got the same thing. Unfortunately, cramps are a mystery still. You may have to just work up to the standing, and make sure that you have good ergonomic shoes.	2015-05-13 14:31:10Z	JohnP

925	Some people get braces later in life as a matter of health. Perhaps the reason they did not get them sooner was that they could not afford them. I, for example, had very crooked teeth, but probably wouldn't have had anything done about them had they not been putting extreme pressure on my sinuses.	2015-05-10 23:23:10Z	L.B.
925	First, vanity is a philosophical concept, not a medical one. So there are no really good criteria for a doctor to tell you what is a "sign of vanity". Second, you seem to see an implicit dichotomy between "fulfilling a vanity wish" and "improving one's health", but I don't see such a dichotomy, especially after considering the negative effect of low self esteem on mental health. I am flagging to close this question, because in its current formulation it's not a medical one. I believe that there is a good question hidden here which can be answered in medical terms, but you'll have to edit it.	2015-05-11 09:50:10Z	rumtscho

918	I recommend carefully distinguishing between deodorants and antitranspirants when phrasing the question, as the two are often colloquially used as synonyms but in fact they are not, and there are significant differences in their potential side effects; but then again, this is relativized as you explicitly ask about consequences on inhalation, which then would exclude the others. So I'd generally recommend paraphrasing the question to be more specific.	2015-05-19 11:23:30Z	cirko

HFCS is actually great for runners as I mention here: health.stackexchange.com/questions/774/… Additionally, we try to do one-post-one-question to keep things specific and clear.

903	There are a great many questions that a good physician would ask you as part of your work-up, as well as doing a thorough physical exam, neither of which we can do in their place. These symptoms are best addressed with your physician. If you are still concerned, perhaps a second opinion is in order.	2015-05-08 03:56:47Z	anongoodnurse
903	I did actually have a second opinion, and he said the same thing, though he did recommend me to go see a heart specialist just to be on the safe side. But he reassured me everything is fine.	2015-05-08 04:13:58Z	
903	Then you either believe him and your first doctor, or you don't, and get a third opinion. It's not unheard of. But the Internet can't take the place of a physician.	2015-05-08 04:16:02Z	anongoodnurse
903	@anongoodnurse, there are many physicians like myself who would be happy to provide a differential diagnosis for Pat given the known information.  Of course to narrow it down further a physical exam and further tests would be required, but a differential is definitely possible.	2015-05-08 06:29:27Z	Kenshin
903	@NinjaDoc Ask yourself if you are comfortable with anyone with an Internet connection also offering a differential diagnoses. I can appreciate that, in all likelihood, you are a doctor (after all, it says so right there in your name <grin>). But The situation we really need to avoid is where we're soliciting personalized medical consultations where everyone votes: "should this guy go to the hospital?"

Under what circumstances was the low blood sugar measured, during exercise or during a normal visit to the doctor? Is your friend on some unusual diet?	2015-05-07 11:32:23Z	rumtscho
894	@rumtscho That is normal where I live. Many of my relatives experience low blood sugar sometimes during the day. They eat normal food and are healthy housewives. They have been advised to keep a box of glucose at home and to gulp some spoons down whenever they feel low. Doctors are different and patients are different but the prescribed treatment is same.	2015-05-12 07:05:28Z

892	Definitely, thanks! I'm very curious where those numbers came from: The numbers of drinks in Figure 1 and figure 2 are ballpark guesstimates based on my experience with alcohol and with heavy drinkers and with my investigation of the best sources available on the topic.  But no mention of what these 'best sources' are.

825	@Kaadzia, well the heart rate is normal, but I don't have to concentrate on it to feel each beat through my chest.  It doesn't really feel like pounding really hard either, I can just feel it go beat, beat, beat, beat at a normal rhythm all the time.	2015-05-05 07:42:36Z	
825	I have the same issue. My heart also beats unusually quickly (often 90+ bpm, even when at rest). It may be worthwhile checking with a doctor (especially if health care costs and finances are not a very big deal for you). I had a bunch of checkups and echo cardiograms. They suspected a hole in the heart. Turns out there wasn't. I am still not entirely convinced that my heart is perfectly healthy, but at least I (and my medical advisors) have done some due diligence.	2015-05-16 14:10:13Z	Kenny LJ
825	@NinjaDoc, Are you doing some exercises?	2015-06-03 20:40:46Z	Pacerier
825	Are you thin? I know this sounds like a strange question, but my doctor told me that us skinny people are "blessed" with feeling our heartbeats far more easily even than people of "average" weight.	2016-08-24 12:52:51Z	L.B.
823	Do you have some specific concerns? I mean this is really common problem and many large institutions (ie. MayoClinic, NHS) have detailed descriptions of the side effects of each antidepressant drug. This information is fairly easily accessed online.	2015-05-04 11:51:32Z	arkiaamu

822	It depends on a lot of factors. First of all the reason for rehydration, that is, how did one become dehydrated in the first place (just sweating during a vigorous workout, sever vomiting or diarrhea or something else); the severity; the length of a process and likelihood of reoccurrence etc. Also, why did you tag it with blood-pressure: because of low blood-pressure due to (mild) hypovolaemia or because of ingredients unadvisable for people with high blood-pressure? I'm not sure it can be answered easily here - it has to fall in between being too broad and asking for personalised advice.	2015-05-29 14:44:31Z	Lucky
820	P.S. Before giving a bunch of disclaimers about how I should let a dental professional do this: Trust me, I know. I don't care to justify my choice to do this here. If you don't have any practical advice for scaling techniques or information about the actual question above, please don't bother commenting.	2015-05-02 04:40:21Z	
820	Sorry, no practical advice for scaling or information on the actual question above. Mind if I comment anyway by asking a question? How do you know the condition of those teeth? How do you know it's below the gum line yet don't know how deep?	2015-06-24 04:15:32Z	Carey Gregory
820	I used one of the dental picks to go slightly below the gumline and managed to scrape off a rather large chunk of calculus. But I cannot determine how far down it goes (it's extremely painful to explore down below the gumline any further than a millimeter or so).	2015-06-25 06:45:53Z	
819	Hi Brimby, and thanks for joining. I'm a little bit confused however: what is exactly your question, regarding health? Just the size of what you're doing?	2015-05-02 00:47:37Z	Shlublu
819	@Shlublu I think it's about phisiology of digestion: which organic and biochemical factors influence the gut microbiota activity, given the fact that the same diet is followed by two healty subjects. Good question, upvoted.	2015-05-02 20:26:35Z	Attilio
819	@Attilio I didn't vote it at all as to me it wasn't clear - which doesn't mean the question was unclear. I got what you said.	2015-05-02 22:18:21Z	Shlublu
819	I guess I'm not even sure what I'm asking. I was just hoping someone could explain where the difference between us (me & gf) lies. Something very similar to what Attilio suggested, except that I specifically wanted to hear if some people actually digest a certain amount of fiber/cellulose from their diet.	2015-05-05 06:38:01Z

813	This is a pretty broad question. I'm guessing you are asking about potential allergic reactions, but I could imagine someone asking about disease and pregnancy protection in this context. (I assume you know better, but people finding this question via Google might not.) Could you narrow the question down?	2015-05-01 18:53:35Z	Jon Ericson
813	@JonEricson actually there are some pretty significant considerations that are not broad. And very worthy of mention, possibly the question should be narrowed to females, but I don't think there is anything else worthy of mention.	2015-05-01 19:03:06Z	
813	Yes, there are some specific considerations. I can read about them on Wikipedia and elsewhere. But what are you specifically asking about?	2015-05-01 19:43:42Z	Jon Ericson
813	I found a broad strokes answer relatively easy to write, and I don't necessarily think this question requires a high degree of specificity in being asked, especially since the use of a personal lubricant may have several different simultaneous concerns that must be considered.	2015-05-01 21:01:33Z	Fomite

802	@Ooker People developing allergies to things they previously did not have an allergy to isn't uncommon so there's no need for the OP to describe such a person.	2015-07-06 23:06:03Z	Carey Gregory

801	I have found no studies that indicate such an approach is possible. Drinking milk does nothing to stimulate the body into producing lactase.	2015-05-01 16:25:25Z	Sean Duggan
801	@SeanDuggan It's not as simple as that. The pro-biotic crowd has been  touting forever how perhaps the lack of diversity in our diary diet may be contributing to the failed lactase  production — that consuming more fermented milk products (or even raw milk) might help our "gut recover" so that lactase production can resume and alleviate symptoms of lactose intolerance. So it's at least plausible that an increased consumption in dairy might be part of that process. If somone cannot flesh that out as an answer, I'll see if I can find better references.	2015-05-01 17:43:48Z	Robert Cartaino
801	@RobertCartaino: I have found similar claims, but none of them have been bold enough to state there is an effect once the probiotics are eliminated from the system. Probably wise given that's verging into a medical effect, and they've already been slammed by proof that probiotics have a negligible temporary effect.	2015-05-01 18:04:34Z	Sean Duggan
797	It may be true that 1 pound of fat, when metabolized, provides 3500 Calories of energy. However, this does not mean that removing 3500 Calories from your diet or spending 3500 Calories on physical activity will necessarily lead to having 1 less pound of fat in your body. Many factors affect which energy sources your body will use, and the body also adapts to energy expenditure in different ways.	2015-05-04 05:37:17Z	octern

797	@blacksmith37 a 'food calorie' AKA Calorie, is just an easy way of saying kilocalorie, ie one thousand calories. While it is incorrect to say calorie when it's actually a kilocalorie, it's widely common. I guess I shouldn't be speading it though..	2017-11-20 23:28:07Z	
793	Hi Aequitas, thanks for joining and asking. Your question begins by this statement: "We all know that about 3500 calories is equivalent to 1 pound (7500 cals for 1kg).". I don't know whether this is true or false, but as it is an assumption your question is based on, it should be documented. If there is no way to document it, the question should be whether this is a valid assumption.	2015-04-30 23:10:20Z	Shlublu
793	I'm not sure what you mean, those numbers are commonly used everywhere for that amount of weight loss/gain. Besides the exact numbers are irrelevant, another phrasing of the question could be assuming zero calories burnt (including from breathing and such) could you gain more weight than the weight of what you are consuming? Does that make sense? or If I see "X" on the scale, can my weight only go down assuming no consumption of food or water?	2015-04-30 23:27:22Z

793	It is possible, not directly, but rather indirectly by the byproducts that the foods attract. Eating more carbs will cause muscles to store the carbs as glycogen. Glycogen makes muscles store more water. The water retention added on to the carbs that are stored might way more than the food that brought in the carbs, although I have no empirical evidence for this. You might hear people talk about dropping 2 pounds in a week because they lowered their carb intake. What really happens is they lost mostly water weight, not fat. Total caloric deficit determines meaningful weight loss.	2016-02-01 05:24:27Z	JoJo

It is a very common ailment, although the full-blown version that puts people in the hospital is now very rare in the United States (unless you are an alcoholic).

If you want to ask only about the headache medicines and whether the listed OTC meds are safer, that would work. However, the question asks about all OTC and prescription meds, and the answer is going to vary by med. Also, the «why are some meds OTC?» question is going to vary by country and probably could be a question all its own (that would be questionably on-topic as it’s really a policy issue).	2015-04-27 04:24:31Z	Susan
715	@Susan: I must say I disagree with you. I see relevance in this question. Common people often ask why drug A is OTC but drug B is not. True, the guidelines vary from country to country but the rationale behind that does not. As so, I think this question can be answered and it is not too broad.

Register your weighings and observe the trend. That's the only thing that's accurate. Besides that, is weight loss really the goal? Or is it fat loss? You might gain some muscle, and thus weight. Maybe you should focus more on waist line, as it is a more honest measure.	2017-07-21 10:59:31Z	Dennis Haarbrink

663	The current meta guidance on this indicates that it is on topic both here and at biology.SE because it relates to a specific disease process. Anyone with an opinion: please contribute there.	2015-04-24 02:44:59Z	Susan
663	@Susan I agree. There are obviously places where we will overlap with Biology, but this seems to be a good question that will fit both here and Bio.SE.	2015-04-24 03:01:08Z	michaelpri

657	Could you please also clarify which foods you don't want in the answer and what exactly makes them "impractical"?	2015-04-23 20:11:51Z	Patrick Hoefler
657	Why do you believe kale, peas, beans, sardines, figs, almonds, etc. are "too impractical to replace milk as a daily source of sufficient calcium and nutrition"?	2015-04-23 20:39:22Z	anongoodnurse
657	@anongoodnurse - Because of volume is what I got out of his text (10 cups of turnips).	2015-04-23 21:50:53Z	JohnP
657	@anongoodnurse - We should probably let him clarify, but I believe he is saying it's impractical to eat the volume necessary to get the 1000 minimum recommendation. Such as kale, you would need to eat 10 chopped cups to get 1000 mg.	2015-04-23 22:08:28Z	JohnP
656	There are significant long-term effects of pedriatric cataract surgery, but not necessarily related to the vitreous. Do I understand you right that you only want to know what the consequences regarding the aging process of the vitreous after lensectomy in childhood are (with or withour lens insertion)?	2015-05-20 21:59:16Z	cirko
656	@cirko asking abut all the long-term effects of this would seem to be too broad.  I'm specifically curious (here) about the effect of aging on the vitreous and aqueous: do they combine or interfere with each other? If so, what are the effects?  I'm asking about the case without lens insertion, as I have the impression (perhaps incorrect) that it's the lens that keeps the two fluids separate.	2015-05-20 22:28:38Z	
652	This seems like a great question! I think you should put a bounty on this one, since it hasn't gotten a response yet.	2015-05-09 23:35:16Z	Dave Liu
652	possible duplicate of Does fried food cause gastritis and other gastrointestinal tract illnesses?	2015-09-11 05:58:18Z	WYSIWYG
652	Doesn't look like a duplicate for me, as the other question is completely different and it relates to cooking with oils only.	2015-09-11 12:48:13Z	
652	@kenorb Both the questions are about cooking in oil. And the answer there does answer this one as well.	2015-09-22 16:41:24Z	WYSIWYG
652	It looks the answer to this question is in title of the other one (fried food cause gastritis and other gastrointestinal tract illnesses), but it doesn't clarify that this is cause mainly because of frying on oil with past smoke point. The answer says only that it leads to chemical reactions, but this is what I'm aware of and it is mentioned in the question. However I still can't find exact health dangers of frying past a smoking point there.	2015-09-22 17:40:00Z	
649	Is oligonol supposed to be good (or bad) for health? Without any context, I don't get the question.	2015-04-23 16:04:22Z	Shlublu

649	But why should it be good? Have you heard something, or read something, for example?	2015-04-23 16:08:33Z	Shlublu

641	I've voted to keep this open, based on the recent edits. I think this question is reasonable.	2015-04-23 15:19:30Z	Nate Barbettini
634	As it stands, I think this is a good question in theory, but very broad in practice. Also, if you could summarize the key points from the link, that will help rather than just saying "data shows".	2015-04-22 20:15:02Z	JohnP
634	It's really annoying to be downvoted and put on hold when you can help me to improve the question just by adding some comment as JohnP did. Followin his suggestions I modified the question and now it's very specific, and also includes some key points.	2015-04-24 11:20:50Z	
634	There could be many issues of a question that take too much time for one person to list at the moment, so putting it on hold is a way of drawing attention to help fix it. Also, people sometimes think that when they downvote, that's enough to make the asker fix their question. For some it's enough, but it can differ based on asker's experience.	2015-04-24 23:13:02Z	Dave Liu
628	The question is based on a flawed understanding. Chemiosmosis refers to the movement of hydrogen ions through a cellular membrane, not that the membrane is made up of hydrogen ions. Additionally, kirlian photography is unrelated to the health of a food.	2015-04-22 15:28:57Z	JohnP
625	This seems a bit out of left field. Before this gets closed as too broad or unclear, do you know of any actual claims that flour might be addictive? That way folks can better answer if there have been any studies investigating those claims.	2015-04-22 14:06:54Z	Robert Cartaino
625	Ok quoted one study. Please don't vote to close, just help to improve the question. Is it better now?	2015-04-22 14:43:06Z	
625	As the duplicate answers show, this is essentially a duplicate question (And I realize the original question that had both elements, sugar and flour was flagged as too broad). Since the other question has both this answer and a second, accepted answer, I am closing this as a duplicate of that one.	2015-06-03 18:02:23Z	JohnP
625	@JohnP yep: it has gone exactly as you realized: flagged as too broad on health.SE, while this is the exact same way scientists think about addictive food, not separate ingredients. one more reason to think that sometimes we should be more tolerant here on health.SE and accept things as they are before flagging/downvoting..	2015-06-03 18:22:34Z	
625	@JohnP so shall I restore the original form of 'food' addiction? the title now ('sugar') is misleading	2015-06-03 18:24:45Z	
621	I want to say no, additional symptoms should have arisen in the time frame, but I'm struggling to think of what the source would be to back that up.  I'm leafing through old textbooks at the moment.	2016-01-30 02:34:01Z	Atl LED
620	Maybe this question would be better off in skeptics.stackexchange.com	2015-04-22 15:22:15Z	Mr Lister

617	Why do you think acne could be related to the sleeping? How do you tell if it's acne or a skin rash? Acne is most commonly linked to the hormone levels, a skin rash could be a skin allergy to laundry detergent. Which one you think you could have?	2015-04-22 13:28:00Z	kenorb
617	I don't think it's related to sleeping, but perhaps position of rest. Maybe particles clog the pores on my back. It's acne because there are pimples there.	2015-04-23 00:26:46Z

615	I'm wondering if this falls into "personal medical advice" and should be reformatted. I'm inclined to answer this kind of question with, "go see a doctor".	2015-04-27 07:33:30Z	Dave Liu
615	@DaveL - I can see how that could be interpreted, but it's a general enough situation that I think it could be useful.	2015-04-27 13:51:13Z	
608	Hm. The question is premised on the idea that some substances (not conditions, I assume) accumulate in the liver and cause disease, but the question asks which substances do that. If we're talking about people who are basically normal to start with and exist in a basically normal environment, I can't think of any off the top of my head. If you could specify a particular substance, this Q&A might be more useful to help you sort out fact from fiction. This is an area where there is a lot of mythology circulating.	2015-04-21 11:11:03Z	Susan
608	Additionally, you have 4 different questions listed. Makes it very broad.	2015-04-21 13:39:18Z	JohnP
608	It might help if you could provide a citation for the claim that substances do accumulate in the liver in the first place. This claim is commonly made by people selling unregulated remedies and quack treatments with no scientific evidence. On the other hand I'm sure that there are some persistent pollutants that can be found in the liver, but I don't know whether they accumulate there more strongly than in other parts of the body.	2015-04-21 15:18:49Z	octern
608	@Attilio, I can appreciate your frustration, but trying to start a broad discussion about whatever it is the liver does is not really a good starting point for a site like this. You're asking about a topic you "are not informed about" and then asking how to get rid of the conditions folks here come up with. This type of Q&A is better suited to solving very specific problems, but it isn't very good at hosting conversations around an opening premise like "tell me about the liver." That's just not really what we do, and not a good use case for this type of Q&A. Sorry about the confusion.	2015-04-21 17:48:06Z	Robert Cartaino
608	Attilio, I think you’ve done a great job adding the research about PCBs to the question. Narrowing it to just PCBs, it could be a good question. The broader question about whether toxins do indeed accumulate in the liver was asked separately. That isn’t too broad because he’s asking just about whether it happens. Yours is more about specifics of what substances and what to do, so the scope also needs to be narrower in my opinion. I’ve voted to leave closed for now, but I would change my vote if you’re willing to narrow.	2015-04-22 18:33:31Z	Susan

606	Why are you specifically asking about diet for this question, when recurrence is likely more a question of the immune system? Is there a specific reason for that?	2015-04-21 17:34:57Z	Fomite
606	@Formite yes their is a reason according to what i have heard by many if the proper diet is not followed this may occur and again making person's immunity more weak..	2015-04-21 18:30:55Z	
606	The grammar and style of this question is fairly poor. That might be another reason for downvotes (I'm just speculating).	2015-04-21 23:23:09Z	Nate Barbettini
604	i think for all the questions same person down voted , i am asking the reason for down vote , when you are down voting atleast suggest what is wrong with question.	2015-04-21 05:43:33Z	
602	Wow, never knew those existed. Thanks. I've heard that the natural wrist/arm position is that of like when you are holding a glass of water in your hand. So these probably are a lot more ergonomic for you. If anything, it might not be a bad idea to use a mouse like this 5 days out of the week and a regular mouse the other 2 days, just to change it up.	2015-04-22 00:34:59Z	
597	Well, some people can't have gluten, that's probably the main reason. Also, your title doesn't ask the same question as the body. Could you clarify this?	2015-04-20 20:59:11Z	michaelpri
597	Because advertising. And I'd consider trying to narrow the question down, this is a large topic.	2015-04-20 21:18:36Z	JohnP
597	What suprises me is that we see more and more "gluten free" food, shops, restaurants, for a few years. I'm wondering whether they are some valid facts behind that (I'm genuinely wondering - this looks like marketing but facts may exist). The problem is that the question asks what are people looking for, not what is behind. I would find more interesting to start from the facts. Did the number of proven-intolerant people increased ? Or what are the proven consequences of gluten on intolerant people? (Both questions are examples)	2015-04-20 22:07:46Z	Shlublu
597	@Shlublu Problem is that there are people who do have a condition, celiac disease, who can't tolerate gluten but a gluten free diet is also becoming a fad which is causing issues for those who have celiac disease. I plan on writing an answer to this when I get some time.	2015-04-20 22:33:38Z	Joe W
597	@JoeW I edited this from the review queue without seeing your answer, so I apologize if this changes what you were responding to.

586	Voted to close as "too broad" since there would likely be many different answers to this question depending on what type of food you are talking about specifically. If you want to refine your question and make it more specific, I'd be happy to reverse my vote.	2015-04-20 11:17:39Z	Nate Barbettini
586	You should focus on specific type only, e.g. sugar.	2015-04-20 13:33:43Z	kenorb
586	ok, so let's focus on sugar this time, and perhaps create more questions for other foods.	2015-04-20 14:05:09Z	
586	If food addiction is compulsive eating in a manner that is detrimental to the individual. For example if you compulsively eat candy all day long, but make sure your diet contains all important nutrients and your caloric intake equals output, and the eating can be done while working, then you are not addicted. By this definition most programmers aren't coffee addicts at all! Simply because the eating/drinking is not detrimental.	2015-06-04 09:40:05Z	jiggunjer

564	Both the benefits (vitamins, etc in peel) and the risks (propensity of peel to absorb pesticides - assuming there is some danger there) would depend on the type of fruit.  Given the number of available fruits, this seems too broad to me.	2015-04-18 15:26:16Z	Susan
564	@JohnP I would just hope that we can decide from the information, because 'tell me if I should' was deemed too broad and effected this closure? Please feel free to edit my OP directly.	2015-04-18 17:56:29Z	
564	I would rather see the question deal with whether fruit rinds are a health hazard, regardless of the question of organic or not. (Since the issue of pesticide or other residue on the rind affects both conventional and organic produce.)	2015-04-24 13:18:47Z	Nate Barbettini
564	This question needs to specify what type of fruits, pesticides, benefits, and risks we're talking about. Also, plants can naturally produce pesticides, which might not always be dangerous to us.	2015-04-24 21:59:12Z	Dave Liu
561	From the help section: Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you’re asking too much. All of your questions, even being split apart, are very broad and far reaching.	2015-04-18 14:18:15Z	JohnP
561	What affects immunity in humans is still too broad. Answering would consist in sumarizing all know litterature on this subject.	2015-04-18 14:42:21Z	Shlublu
561	@Shlublu I've deleted the broad portion. Now this question is also of yes/no type. The answer would be of one word, either yes or no.	2015-04-18 16:04:33Z	
556	I feel the need to include the note as a reminder in case people have strong opinions on this subject.	2015-04-17 22:14:16Z

529	Note that of the digestible portion of the egg, the white is mostly protein, according to a Google search. According to another Google search, the yolks are high in fat, including saturated fat, and very high in cholesterol. In other words, the limit really concerns how many egg yolks you can safely eat in a day, as the whites have very little to be worried about. Finally, due diligence reveals that Google pulls its nutrition information from the USDA (see 'sources' at the bottom of the nutrition info).	2015-04-16 06:36:34Z	TheEnvironmentalist
529	@TheEnvironmentalist - More and more, the cholesterol in egg yolks being bad is being proven a myth for healthy individuals (The constraints in the original question). They may actually be beneficial, as cholesterol and saturated fat helps in testosterone production. Much of the "bad" association may have been mistakenly attributed to eggs, and ignoring the usual side dishes of bacon and sausage.	2015-04-17 16:31:49Z	JohnP
529	@JohnP Personally, I consume ridiculous quantities of eggs, and I don't disagree with you. For validity's sake, however, care to provide references? Note that I didn't deny that some cholesterol is good for you, but the liver produces all the cholesterol you need, and even more in those with diets high in saturated fats. The same source also discusses how excess cholesterol can cause cardiovascular problems, including heart attack and stroke, among a number of others.	2015-04-17 22:23:28Z	TheEnvironmentalist
529	@DaveL Sure, added. Is it okay now?	2015-04-25 02:34:15Z

527	The instructions generally tell you how much to take daily, but not for how long.	2015-04-15 22:24:06Z	
527	Yeah, because different people react differently. They aren't going to open themselves up to a lawsuit by saying "Sure, take it for a week, no problem", and then get sued when someone reacts after 4 days. Plus, they have no information on other drugs the person is or may take in the future, etc. Your "typical healthy adult" is a myth. :) :)	2015-04-15 22:25:45Z	JohnP
527	@FranckDernoncourt - Maybe the opinion based votes are because the questions are asking for broad, sweeping generalities? I haven't looked at all your questions, so that is just a theory. (Also, IIRC, you tend to ask a lot of one line "why" questions, which also lends itself to that type of close vote). Not a criticism, just an observation.	2015-04-16 14:08:57Z	JohnP
527	@JohnP Good point, I see what you mean, I haven't thought that too opinion-based could be used that way. Probably much more explicit to vote as too broad though, but I can see the intent.	2015-04-16 14:36:23Z	Franck Dernoncourt

521	@anongoodnurse After some checking: some of the cases I am referring to were suspected or confirmed COPD, and some were undetermined (at our level: we were just not told what was suspected).

520	@JohnP, yes a good thought and research has indeed been done on patients with hemochromatosis for this reason.  I believe the studies generally tend to support the iron hypothesis.	2015-04-28 17:05:42Z	Kenshin

506	Melatonin (youth hormone, also a sleeping pill) is not harmful for health, as it's hormone which you already have in your body which balance your sleep.	2015-04-14 18:13:05Z	kenorb
506	@kenorb Just because it's a hormone doesn't mean it's harmless. Hormones can have pretty serious effects, they should be carefully evaluated just like any other drug.	2015-04-14 18:52:57Z	Mad Scientist
506	@kenorb that's like saying there are no side effects to taking the contraceptive pill - when there clearly are. Your body's hormones are at that level for a reason.	2015-04-14 19:29:35Z	Tim
506	I'm sure not all hormones are safe to take, however I was talking about melatonin specifically (it has very low toxicity in studies), it's safe in long-term, available freely over-the-counter, you can't overdose it (all people who tried to commit a suicide with melatonin, they failed:) and majority of older people are taking it every the day for many years to regulate their biological clock.	2015-04-14 20:34:12Z	kenorb
506	What is the scientific background to state that one needs to sleep 8 hours? It has also been suggested that what is imporant for good rest is to respect deep sleep by cycles, each cycle being of aprox. hour and a half. This may not be an acurate nor standard idea, but it's worth discussing. Reference: sleepyti.me.	2016-10-18 11:55:06Z	nilon

498	@kenorb there are other Jewish rules that make sense - not eating pork in a hot country is a good idea, it is likely to go off quickly. He wants to know (I think) whether or not there is a similar health background to Meat + Milk, or if it was simply a rule for respect to the animals.	2015-04-14 15:41:30Z	Tim
498	I'm not a Jew, but answered at Judaism, although I couldn't find any scientific studies to support that. Only from 2007 and 2010 which says consumption of milk and processed meat could cause prostate cancer, but these studies aren't clear how they consumed meat and dairy (whether mixed or not).	2015-04-14 17:05:23Z	kenorb
498	Unless there is some time frame that you can't consume one after you consume the other I am not sure what kind of benefit it will have as they can easily mix up in the digestive track later.	2015-04-20 22:57:44Z	Joe W
498	@JoeW If milk + meat was more prone to spoilage this could be a reason against mixing them--it's like the rule against pork made sense at the time and place that it came about.	2015-04-24 22:15:44Z	Loren Pechtel
496	Could you add a citation to which part you're referring to?	2015-04-14 18:04:18Z	kenorb

492	This is exactly the kind of questions that I would like to see more in this website. Unfortunately I can't answer it at the moment. Looking forward to an answer to this question.	2015-04-14 06:08:34Z	Rana Prathap
492	Agreed. Wish I had the knowledge to answer.	2015-04-15 02:28:06Z	Nate Barbettini
489	It's kinda hard to make a double blind test on that. People tend to note when you poke needles in them.	2016-06-09 13:24:30Z	Tomáš Zato
489	@TomášZato not that hard, you just poke them in different places then should be effective.  Acupuncture has points for different body parts.	2016-06-09 13:37:26Z	
489	Maybe you just poked undiscovered spots? What you propose would be somewhat conclusive but would leave lot of place for doubt I think.	2016-06-09 13:39:55Z	Tomáš Zato
480	Thought of this question last night when I woke up with a full-face mask filled with drool. Since that doesn't normally happen, it might be a side effect of the drugs I started taking a couple of days ago.	2016-01-05 17:20:38Z	1--
475	Where are you getting your information on alcoholic mouthwash causing cancer? A quick Google search showed results that say that is debatable and that other factors need to be considered.  Is the use of mouthwash considered excessive? Articles list more then 3 times in a day as excessive.  Is it being used as a substitute for proper oral care such as brushing and flossing? More articles list that as a major issue for people.  I have seen in your posts about wanting to avoid something for some reason but not going into detail as to why and showing evidence.	2015-04-12 17:19:45Z	Joe W
475	@Law People here don't have to back up their claims in questions. However yours is a big one and I don't like to see it - someone could come along and see it, without any evidence to back it up. I have edited it out until you have strong evidence for it. We don't need to spread rumours on this site.	2015-04-12 17:29:24Z	Tim
475	@Tim Thanks for your concern. I've tempered my OP. Better now? I use the auxiliary verb 'may'.	2015-04-12 17:37:13Z	
475	@JoeW Better now? I apologise for any offense caused.	2015-04-12 17:37:54Z

474	I've seen quantitative protocols for measuring the strength of an immune response, such as the number of antibodies produced immediately after a seasonal flu vaccine, or the degree of localized inflammatory response after receiving a standardized skin injury. However, I'm pretty sure most "natural immune boosters" were not tested in this way (or possibly any way).	2015-04-12 17:16:03Z	octern
474	I remember some article on a medicine skeptics blog mentioning that the medical term for a "boosted medical system" is "inflammation" - a catchy phrase, of course, but it illustrates well that the idea of a "boosted" immune system is oversimplified, if it has any merit at all.	2015-04-13 15:15:37Z	rumtscho
474	Your question is a bit confusing. Your main question is how to boost immune system, and the sub-questions are about acupuncture (which is therapy, not energy booster) and links to 7+14+15 different ways to boost immune system. Each claim should have separate question, as it's too broad to answer all of them. So I'll stick with your title question.	2015-04-15 14:35:35Z	kenorb
474	@kenorb Sorry if the question is confusing. I included links to various lists to give an example of the things many people claim can boost the immune system. I suppose a better wording of my main question would be, "is it possible to boost the immune system?"	2015-04-15 14:38:16Z	
474	@rumtscho It's Mark Crislp's line, he also uses it on his infectious disease podcast, and IMO he's not wrong. A "boosted immune system" is also a pro-thrombotic state, and isn't necessarily something one wants.	2015-04-15 16:04:12Z	Fomite
473	Have you considered looking into why you need something to energize you? If you are looking to avoid caffeine addiction how would that be any different then energy drink addiction?	2015-04-12 16:38:36Z	Joe W
473	@JoeW I agree that energy drink addiction harms. Personally, I was asking the above for sufferers of Seasonal affective disorder who'd benefit from a sap of energy during rainy, grey days. Does this help?	2015-04-12 16:43:58Z	
473	Overall I find the question confusing, there is no real reason listed as why to avoid caffeine and it sounds like you are asking for personal reasons not as a general question to help others.	2015-04-12 16:52:11Z	Joe W
463	This is a great question. I was going to attempt to answer but got hung up by an issue that exemplifies a problem with scientific reports in the popular media: I can’t figure out which study that BBC article is referring to! A search using the author and date mentioned there Bashir w[Author] AND 2006[dp]  yields two studies, neither of which exactly match the BBC description. Jez, if you have a better idea, let me know. I don’t feel like I can answer without evaluating that study.	2015-04-11 14:03:34Z	Susan
463	Pretty bad form for the BBC not to even give a proper reference to the study they mentioned!	2015-04-11 20:46:09Z

439	@Tim - While the title says new pair, it means new to him. They are second hand, which means they are probably already broken in, and if they are running type shoes, those have not needed "Breaking in" for many years. However, there is no way to diagnose what is causing a pain over the internet, so I have voted to close. FWIW, similar questions on Fitness SE are also considered off topic and closed on a regular basis.	2015-04-09 14:55:20Z	JohnP
436	I'm afraid this question is too broad.	2015-04-09 09:32:36Z	Shlublu

408	I have heard a few specific deleterious health effects (quality of sleep, weight gain, etc.) but I don't want to restrict the question to those specific points as I am interested to know all deleterious health effects, and I don't want to create one question for each potentially deleterious health effect.	2015-04-08 15:00:43Z

397	@Shog9 I'm a bit behind on meta musings, is a generalised question (see edit) ok?	2015-04-21 09:11:43Z	
397	To me this is, as you said, a "you should see a doctor" question (or at least give a call, he/she'll tell you whether visiting is needed). So you answerd it right and at the same time it should be closed...	2015-04-21 09:13:17Z	Shlublu
397	After review of your edit, I voted to leave it closed. Your base question is still "what should I do", and the answer is still - "See a doctor".	2015-04-21 14:54:33Z	JohnP

393	@Tim rolled back. I think the present form looks awkward, though. I'd rather have the reference source inline somehow. Probably a topic for meta discussion.	2015-04-07 14:09:26Z	Nate Barbettini
393	Probably, thanks for doing that. I'm not sure which is best now, but I don't like having to follow the link to find out what it is... Do you want to start the discussion?	2015-04-07 14:11:13Z	Tim
393	I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is asking for treatment suggestions which (currently) is off topic.	2015-04-07 15:14:29Z	Tim
384	I think you might need to be more specific. Are you testing a specific medication, what are the circumstances?	2015-04-06 22:54:28Z	Mary ML
384	I mean there are tests to check if a single drug is useful or useless by arranging groups of people where half receive the actual drug and half receive the placebo. So the drug is being tested not the patient. My question is to test the opposite, I'm interested in knowing if I can test a single patient... with a group of pills, from wich half would be the actual drug and half would be placebos... I think I just answered my own question, or at least I designed the base experiment... anyways, the real question is, are there any serious studies like the one I just described?	2015-04-06 23:07:28Z	
384	@PatrickHoefler done as you asked, please vote to reopen my question :)	2015-04-07 18:19:13Z	
384	I still think this question should be closed, because the answer will not impact the OP's health in any way. It's not about health, it's about a study effect.	2015-04-08 02:20:27Z	JohnP
384	Knowing about your current health state is the 1st step to improving your health. As with any system you need to test what works and what doesn't before intervening. So yes, it does help me in my ability to make an impact on my health and it would also help others who read this.	2015-04-08 05:13:44Z	
383	How much do you exercise/sweat? That makes a difference as well. I would also recommend going through some of the debunking myth writeups on low sodium recommendations.	2015-04-07 01:10:07Z	JohnP

357	You ask about conspiracy: there was in fact a conspiracy in a now discredited researcher to create the link where no link existed.

355	18 is the age for drinking in public. In my country (UK) and possible most of Europe, you are allowed to drink from age 5+ in your home (although nobody is going to be caught for younger than that). You are also (interestingly) allowed to drink in public from 16, as long as you have a meal and an adult.	2015-04-06 08:21:20Z	Tim
355	The US has a lot of variance as well from state to state as far as minimum age by yourself, with someone, with a meal, in residence, etc.	2015-04-09 16:27:17Z	JohnP
355	@JohnP in practice the US has a lot of variance, but there's only one minimum legal age.	2015-04-13 02:38:13Z	Zaralynda
355	@Zaralynda - Federally, yes. It's tied to the funding that the states get for roads. But legally people under 21 can drink in certain situations related to religion, parental consent, location. They still can't purchase, however. For example, Colorado allows minor consumption with parental consent.and presence: alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/APIS_State_Profile.html?state=CO	2015-04-13 03:16:16Z	JohnP

343	This question is way too broad. As @JohnP put it somewhere else on the site, if you can imagine volumes written about that single question, the question needs to be refocused into something more specific. You're asking for everything from history of pesticides to GMOs to environmental impact, some of which doesn't even fall under the scope of health.	2015-04-21 21:07:57Z	Dave Liu

339	Well I'm not asking if it is fun. But ok I think I see your point. Although 'hourly' tests wouldn't define the period of the test but the sampling rate. I would expect the sampling rate to be meaningful, I'm not going for hourly blood tests if the hourly part is gratuitous, but if hourly blood tests can offer useful insight, then I would definitely go for it.	2015-04-05 15:34:25Z

316	One minor nit: The term in this situation is cardioversion, not defibrillation. As the word defibrillation implies, that's what's done to ventricular fibrillation, not ventricular tachycardia.	2015-07-08 01:57:19Z	Carey Gregory
316	The best treatment for ventricular tachycardia depends upon the underlying cause.  A cardiologist with a sub-specialization in cardiac electrophysiology is the specialist who would be most expert at diagnosing and treating this problem.  A test called an EPS is usually done to map the arrhythmia. Implantable defibrillators (AICDs) generally do not replace medical therapies and are often used as an adjunct.  Amiofarone has important long-term toxicities.	2015-07-11 05:24:04Z	scottb

283	So is the question the title and the body irrelevant? The way the body reads is that you want to parse the nutritional label for your specified nutritional goals whereas the other answer is here is how you read the label. The first commenter is correct that you can't tell what is the true question from the body and title.	2015-04-03 17:37:12Z	
283	@dustin - The question exactly relates to the title. I have nutritional goals, but I want to know how to read the label, so that I know how it relates to those goals. How to read = what each part of the label means.	2015-04-03 17:39:33Z	
283	Based on your picture of someone doing martial arts the label is irrelevant to you besides values since 2000 calories is too low. Hence in my answer I spoke of looking at only the pertinent grams not % based on calories of the avg person since an active person intake will wildly differ from label recommendations.	2015-04-03 17:42:51Z

113	Urine is as long as you don't have an infection always sterile. It must be. However one normally cannot access this pure urine without contaminating it. As soon as you pee you normally get some of the bacteria in your genital area inside the first few millilitres of your urine. There's however a practise, where you clean your external meatus of your urethra (e.g. the end of the penis) thoroughly and pee for a short time off and then without stoping the process hold a bottle or something (sterile) underneath it. Urine captured this way is generally considered as as sterile as you can get it.	2015-04-02 10:05:22Z	Dr. Cashberg

65	Nothing definitive enough for an answer, but I know of other individuals reporting a high sensitivity to caffeine.  My guess is that people metabolize it differently.  I have never had coffee, but I've had caffeinated soft drinks from time to time.  I almost never drink them--so it can't be chalked up to tolerance--but I have never noticed any effect from drinking them.  As for the idea that you're experiencing a placebo effect, I'm guessing you could eliminate that possibility by actually measuring your heart rate after having a friend give you something with and without caffeine. Science! :)	2015-04-01 00:36:42Z	msouth
65	@msouth To really rule out the placebo effect, though, it'd have to be a double-blind test with a coffee-like control. Or a caffeine tablet, maybe? :)	2015-04-01 05:00:51Z	
65	@msouth Is the experiment sentient in this case? Wouldn't that mean that it could affect its own outcome?	2015-04-15 14:03:05Z	
57	(Related, but not about bananas): Warts can be stubborn - cryotherapy might take a while and it can be combined with surgical methods (these are usually minor surgeries). Several factors have to be included (general health, size of the wart, duration, how painful is it for you to walk with it etc), but I wouldn't be content with just giving up and waiting indefinitely - there ought to be a time limit for waiting, after which, if the wart is still unresolved, a different approach might be considered.	2015-07-23 15:52:44Z	Lucky
57	Won't comment on bananas, but an old medication originally used for stomach acid reduction has shown some promise in aiding in removal of stubborn viral warts. We used to compound combination wart removing agents that contained the usual acids and cimetidine. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14693487	2016-08-24 16:02:04Z	TheChinBurglar
51	I suppose it depends on many internal and external factors. For example diet as a whole.	2015-03-31 22:48:36Z	cybermonkey
51	The same question has also been asked over on Skeptics SE.	2015-04-01 10:21:43Z	Patrick Hoefler
51	@PatrickHoefler Yes, I see. They seem to have covered the ground quite comprehensively.	2015-04-01 10:36:04Z	
46	I think asking for sweeteners is in general too broad, as each one is made of something else and can have different side effects. So I think one question per different sweetener type should be more reasonable.	2015-04-17 18:11:54Z	kenorb
35	Can somebody explain why it is primarily opinion-based? (question posted on Quora: quora.com/…)	2015-05-19 04:12:53Z	
26	I believe you are referring to the oft-cited link of cell phone use and brain tumors/cancer, but can you cite those claims specifically so folks don't try to close this as "unclear" or "too broad"?	2015-04-20 23:42:38Z	Robert Cartaino
26	Thanks for the nudge in the right direction @Robert, hope that's what you meant.	2015-04-21 20:37:29Z	
26	May we also look into other aspects of cellphone use such as improper posture during use which could cause back problems?	2015-06-28 00:57:04Z	enap_mwf
26	@enap_mwf I fear this would cause the question to become Too Broad, as Robert commented above. Might be worth a new question though. :)	2015-06-28 04:41:40Z	
26	@ShadowWizard sorry, I missed the last paragraph. Thank you for pointing it out.	2015-06-28 04:43:00Z	enap_mwf

22	I think a better question is how could you avoid voice strain when you speak or use your voice in other ways for large portions of the day. This would make it apply to a wider audience as it is not that common to use voice recognition software all day but not uncommon to have a job where you use your voice all day.	2015-04-09 01:05:27Z	Joe W
22	I agree with @JoeW.  You could change your question to make it more generally applicable while still leaving the answers relevant.	2015-04-12 04:26:59Z	Garrett
22	Some advice can be applied to other jobs that require to use voice all day, but some other advice are more specific to speech recognition: microphone sensitivity, choice of voice commands, posture, voice level, etc. So I would prefer to keep the question focus on speech recognition.	2015-04-12 04:53:14Z

5	I thought it was clear that it's the liver and kidneys, not the immune system, that deals with chemical compounds that are not wanted in the human body. And from the top of my head, lead and other heavy metals are known for remaining in the body instead of being properly removed.	2016-06-09 14:00:35Z	Tomáš Zato
4	in my fifth year in a medical college, i've never heard of any research on long term effects after a cured acute infection like common cold. my own suspicion is due to difficulty conducting an systematic investigation for this.	2015-05-12 00:27:12Z	soubunmei
4	It is an error to conclude that "human life is so long due to modern medicine".  Environmental changes, especially sanitation and food availability, had rather more to do with that.	2015-07-10 04:00:17Z	scottb
4	@DrRandy and jiggunjer have posted good answers. This thread is roughly a year old, with no accepted answer, and perhaps that is partly due to the third component of the question not having been answered. How would you propose anyone demonstrate scientifically whether humans have "always had the capacity for exceptionally-long lives"? You cannot, with observational/modern science do this (think scientific method, observation, repeatability). This becomes a question of history. So, you would have to consult historical (including scientifically-accurate religious) documents.	2016-05-11 17:49:20Z	tniles09
