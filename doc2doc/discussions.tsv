0	0	1	Dear members<br /><br />I am posting to let you know about upcoming plans for doc2doc and plans to develop new channels for discussion and debate across all BMJ products.<br /><br />doc2doc’s launch eight years ago pre-dated the rise of Twitter, Facebook, and other social media channels for debating the latest clinical developments. However, over time BMJ has seen more of its readers and customers use these platforms for this purpose.<br /><br />Because of this continuing trend BMJ has decided to close doc2doc. This was a very difficult decision to make because doc2doc has so many loyal, articulate members. Many at BMJ have greatly appreciated its value as a platform to establish what clinicians worldwide think about particular topics and ideas.<br /><br />doc2doc’s success as an online community is due, in no small part, to your hard work and we want to take this opportunity to thank you for all your contributions over the years.<br /><br />BMJ’s focus over the coming months is to consider what a successor to doc2doc might look like. Current thinking is perhaps the launch of a BMJ branded community platform that straddles all BMJ products rather than a “standalone” site? Please let us know your thoughts on this.<br /><br />In the meantime we hope to continue reading your views elsewhere on BMJ webpages. for example, in the form of:<br /><br />Rapid responses to articles on thebmj.com<br /><br />Comments on blogs from thebmj.com<br /><br />Comments on BMJ Talk Medicine podcasts uploaded on SoundCloud <br /><br />Comments on BMJ videos posted on YouTube.<br /><br />Later this year we hope to revamp BMJ blogs. Plans are at an early stage, but we are confident that this new resource will appeal to doc2doc’s eloquent following. We will keep you posted.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.<br /><br />Best wishes<br /><br />Sabreena	Sabreena	2016-06-08 15:26:00	0	0
1	0	1	Surely this is a mispost?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Close Doc to Doc?   With all the volumes of educational posts, from so many medical experts, and now the BMJ is going to close a truly useful tool?   This is pure lunacy.<br /><br /> AS with all things good,  if it works,  someone decides to stop it...<br /><br />  <br /><br /> DuaneF	DuaneF	2016-06-09 15:56:00	0	0
2	0	1	Dear Sabreena Malik and David Payne:<br /><br />Before putting here what I think, suggestions, opinions, etc........I would really like seeing sken, John D, Pat Lush, Kirked, skysteeve, DundeeChest, and other colleagues who live in the UK, so should have perhaps a better idea than I could have about this relationship of doc2doc with the BMJ.<br /><br />Of course, anyone opinion and thoughts matter.<br /><br />For now, it does not seem a good idea closing doc2doc, but I´ll keep an open mind to this BMJ decision.<br /><br />All Best,<br /><br />Joey	Joey Rio	2016-06-10 03:56:00	0	0
3	0	1	Things change,<br /><br /> i would like to thank all the founding members and the current membership of doc to doc. When it started I was still working full time. Now I am retired and only working in a very part time capacity. I feel i have gained from doc to doc and I very much prefer the BMA to the RCGPs. i am in Worcester at the moment having been at a BMA social event at Worcester pottery museum last night.<br /><br /> I will consider using any form that evolves  from Doc to Doc.<br /><br /> The first part of retirement has not been to bad, I am off on my motorcycle to travel to Portugal on Saturday! <br /><br /> My wife will fly and I hope to join her  in Portugal in a few days.

4	0	1	The niche filled by doc2doc is not covered as well by some of the alternatives but I can see it has had an adequate trial run (8 years....). The 2 areas where one had hoped to see more development was in encouraging its potential as an international discussion group for those in medical fields and at various stages of training. It has also been pro-active in developing ideas whereas some of the alternatives (eg BMA rapid responses) are essentially reactive and not as suitable for bouncing ideas into an arena for discussion. The alternative which seems to function best is doctors.net but it does not - and essentially cannot - have the international scope of doc2doc nor the inclusion of loosely related care professionals and can be very diverse.  Personally I have never bothered with Twitter or Facebook so I can't really comment on those. I suspect I am just showing one of my prejudices.<br /><br />  My impression has been that users (not necessarily contributors) of doc2doc have included a wide range of folk interested in the broader aspects of medical care and with a wide range of expertise. Perhaps somewhere in the files of the BMJ a list should be kept of contact addresses should we e ever which to seek an opinion....	sken	2016-06-10 10:18:00	0	0
5	0	1	I was not a founder member of doc2doc but have made some contributions periodically over the last four years. Speaking for myself - as a non medic - it has been thoroughly enjoyable to interact with medical professionals of all specialities from different countries and of various levels of seniority. <br /><br /> My disappointment though is that closing doc2doc seems to have been made unilaterally by the BMJ organisation (which they are perfectly entitled to do) without soliciting from members suggestions how doc2doc might survive. It is probably the case that it would have been closed anyway but it might have been possible for it to continue in another incarnation (not rapid responses etc). I cannot believe it requires huge sums of money or massive input by a large team to keep it moving along, so presumably it is that it no longer 'fits' with whatever the broader plan for BMJ might be. Is there sufficient interest and support to keep it going? Is there the will at BMJ to keep it going?<br /><br /> About six weeks ago I like many others were told the site was to close and asked to say nothing. I felt very uncomfortable with that. It didn't seem right that folk might start new threads or join the site when the curtain was to fall imminently. Nevertheless the decision seems irrevocable and I shall miss our conversations on such a wide range of topics. It cannot be denied however that posting activity has ebbed and flowed and more lately has dwindled.<br /><br /> Just looking back at the range of topics discussed from medical news to more complex medical conditions, research, Medicolegal case reports etc illustrates the breadth of knowledge and experience that could be available to those with a query and presumably will remain available through internet caches for some time to come.<br /><br /> I would be interested to know the opinions on closing from our respected members abroad - Joey Rio et al.  Perhaps those of us that wish to do so can keep an informal network together.<br /><br /> It would be absolutely remiss not to thank John D for his incredible committment to doc2doc as contributor and moderator for several years. He has always been active starting and contributing to discussions whilst having to constantly bat away advertisements, patients' requests for advice and miscellaneous inappropriate posts. Much appreciated John.<br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2016-06-10 11:56:00	0	0

10	1	1	"Should three-phase trials be abandoned? Andrew V Metcalfe, an associate professor in statistics at the University of Adelaide, asks this in response to the death of a man last month during a drug trial in France.<br /><br />BBC news health editor James Gallagher described the death in his report as ""the bitter price of the new medicines we take for granted."" He concludes: ""Testing such experimental drugs, at the cutting edge of science, can never be completely risk-free.""<br /><br />Professor Metcalfe, responding to a paper on thebmj.com, argues that biotrial phase I trial of an experimental drug has shown that while the risk may be small the consequences can be tragic. <br /><br />Using biometric information such as DNA profiles would shift the emphasis from the estimation of the average effects of a new treatment to the prediction of its effects on specific patients, he concludes."

15	3	1	NHS England have produced a 56 page article 'General Practice Forward View'. There is comment on this by Dr Margaret McCartney in the BMJ of 30th April 2016. She makes several salient points.<br /><br /> Spending money on non-evidence based interventions leads to multiple harms: it wastes time and energy and disrupts the NHS.<br /><br /> £30 m on acceleration towards a paper free environment, where is he evidence of benefit ?<br /><br /> £45 on increasing online consultations, where is the evidence of benefit ?<br /><br /> ... and two elephant sided holes , lack of cost effectiveness of Care Quality Commission.<br /><br /> and the urgent need to stop doing things that don't work, Health and Social Care Act, unnecessary and un proven screening and unnecessary targets.<br /><br /> I only do a few out of hours sessions now. I do worry about General Practice. The almost universal reason that I see patients in OOH is that they could not get a timely appointment with their GP. GP are so busy chasing targets that there is little time left to see ill patients. Prevention may be better than cure . But some times a cure is good and we are all mortal.

20	4	1	Thank you to everyone who posted.<br /><br />The answer is: Left upper lobe collapse probably as a result of hilar bronchogenic carcinoma.<br /><br />The plain film chest radiograph shows the characteristic radiological features of left upper lobe collapse (fig 2⇓): a mediastinal shift to the left side with volume loss in the left hemithorax. Note the hilar and left diaphragmatic elevation associated with a veil-like increased density of the left upper lobe sparing the lingula (the left heart border is clearly seen suggesting that the lingula is aerated). The most likely diagnosis in an adult with a collapsed upper lobe is that of a central obstructing tumour, and this was confirmed in this patient.<br /><br />  <br /><br /><br /><br />Fig 2 Plain film chest radiograph showing veil-like opacity in the left upper zone. Note the deviation of the left hilum and the loss of clarity of the hilar outline secondary to the adjacent collapse (black arrows)<br /><br />You can see more Education articles from The BMJ here	BMJ Education	2016-04-06 15:42:00	0	0
21	5	1	"Is allowing a patient to choose the ethnicity of his of her attending doctor institutional racism? Nadeem Moghal  asked this in a personal view published by The BMJ more than two years ago, but the debate continues in recent responses to the article.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> To cut a long story short, Moghal's employer complied with a family's refusal to have care to their child delivered by black or other minority ethnic doctor, but staff successfully challenged the decision when it came to light.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The hospital's unwitting thoughtlessness, argues the author, falls foul of recommendation's made in The Macpherson Report into the Metropolitan Police's murdery inquiry following the death of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in the 1990s. <br /><br />  <br /><br />One response  to Moghal's article recalls how in 1963, a nurse of Indian origin was told by three people in A&E that ""they preferred to be treated by one of their own.""<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A second doctor asks for advice after hearing that a nursing home patient had told an Asian nurse only to send white doctors and nurses to deliver care .<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Two years on, and medical student Mohammed Sajid reignites the debate in a response from the Czech Republic, reporting hostility towards Muslim staff and students <br /><br />  <br /><br />Jog Anand replies thus, expanding the debate into choosing the gender of a clinician: <br /><br />  <br /><br /> 1. Assuming the patient is a minor and critically ill, I for one would agree to the guardian's choice - rather than see the child die.<br /><br /> 2.Regardless of religion, if a woman patient requests treatment by a woman doctor ( emergency or "" cold"" case), again I would agree to the request.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Jog's arguments are persuasive, but perhaps not when you consider the conclusion to Moghal's 2014 article:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> ""I will always believe that what had gone on was a worthy subject for internal whistleblowing. The key lesson is that immediately confronting and standing up to racists rather than enabling them must be the first step to building equitable organisations. Organisations and especially their leaders must learn; Stephen Lawrence has much to teach us all.""<br /><br />  <br /><br /> I find the personal experiences in the article's response string really powerful."

22	5	1	Thank you for raising this again, David.    <br /><br /> I am amazed that any Trust, surgery or Clinic would make such an undertaking.   For wholly practical reasons, and ignoring the ethical and moral arguments, how can they be sure that a doctor or nurse of the precise background demanded by the patient, and of appropriate training and experience will be available?<br /><br /> And the same applies on gender.     In most circumstances, a chaperone of the appropriate sex may be easier for a hard-pressed department to provide than superimposing that requirement on top of the necessary training and skills.<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-04-01 14:37:00	0	0
23	5	1	Thanks John - yes, I too worry about the logistics here, leaving aside all the moral and ethical issues. <br /><br /> In many ways this issue reminds me of a discussion we had some years ago, when a Jewish doctor declined to treat a patient with a Nazi tattoo.<br /><br /> Again, a very good exchange of views.<br /><br />http://doc2doc.bmj.com/forums/bmj_bmj_jewish-surgeon-patient-nazi-tattoo	David Payne	2016-04-01 14:58:00	0	0
24	5	1	For a whole variety of reasons , I can envisage circumstances where I would decline to be treated by a doctor wearing a facial veil all the time. These reasons are not primarily sexist or religious (I would have the same feeling about a doctor wearing a Balaclava and other items of highly inappropriate dress hampering recognition and facial expression. Surgical masks are not the same as veils and most times I have been through theatres there have been times when I have met the individuals concerned without them.	sken	2016-04-03 13:54:00	0	0

35	7	1	"The BMJ's journal watch blogger Richard Lehman suggests ditching the term hospice on the grounds that ""it carries an unmistakable whiff of medieval incense and the Crusades.""<br /><br />In the UK, he argues in his latest blog, many of them bear the names of Christian saints, addding: ""No wonder you hardly ever see a Muslim patient in a hospice; and I know many atheists who view them with suspicion.""<br /><br />I'm a big fan of hospices. My sister works in one and our late mother attended it in the months before her death, reluctantly at first as she wasn't sure what it would entail. The team there was an incredible source of support to her and to her children, but like Richard I don't like the word. It sounds so antiquated somehow.<br /><br />The problem is, I can't think of another name."	David Payne	2016-02-24 10:15:00	1	0
36	7	1	"David - Many thanks. An interesting point - should we ditch "" hospital"" as well at the same time? I think the connotations of ""hospice"" are appropriate and reflects their development  and what they are. Changing the name would certainly be fashoinable - Society seems completely out of touch with the idea of calling a spade a spade .<br /><br /> The problem for hospices is in large part their roots are based in religion . This might not matter in the UK as religion is as much a cultural attitude rather than a system of belief. To some extent this is in line with CoE primary schools. It may be difficult for those with a strong other faith to grasp and understand this. There is also the problem that they are not part of the NHS in the same way as are hospitals - funding from the public is crucial and it may be in part that the idea of ""hospice"" encourages charitable donations , apart from the feel good factor and the I-might-need-it-one-day prompts. Failure to provide hospice facilities is a reflection to some extent on the local community - not just a lack of community spirit but also the large amounts of money involved are beyond the resources of many poor areas.<br /><br /> As regards what they provide I think I have mixed feelings but as they gradually move to a broader attitude towards care my misgivings become less. <br /><br /> The Muslim question I think is complex. We might need a separate system - think Red Cross and Green Crescent . Perhaps a wing attached to ordinary hospices.

37	7	1	"The modern use of the word hospice is just another example of the wonderful plasticity and adaptability of the English language.   As well as being incredibly welcoming of words from other langauges, and making up new ones, about a thousand a year according to the OED, it re-uses old ones.<br /><br />Examples?  Gay, nice (was ""exact""), guy (name>effigy>generic male term>generic people term, with sidetracks to mockery), car (car/t), bit (small fragment>digital atom)(see also tweet, tag, stream, friend), troll(mythical ogre>digital ogre), spam (meat of unknown origin>messages of unkonown origin.  Hmmmm maybe not so re-used!) <br /><br />   To indict ""hospice"" with medievalism and incense is a petty criticism - as David says, if you want a different one think of of something better.<br /><br />The tendency of Hospices to have saintly names is down to the honourable tradition of selfless giving associated with religion of all forms, that is about the only factor that excuses religion for all its other excesses.    Other societies, Moslem, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, have similar traditions of giving - do thye have hospices and what are they called?    English might be glad to aborb those words too!<br /><br />John"	John D	2016-02-25 08:29:00	0	0
38	7	1	I have to disagree with Richard Lehman on this one (I think his musings on 'lust and rage' in the same blog are much better)<br /><br /> The NHS has rightly concentrated attention in recent years on the care of people at the end of life.  We hardly hear any serious criticism of hospice care; the big problem with hospices is that they are too few and far between. It would be decades before end-of-life care at home could be consistently at that level and suggestions that general hospital wards could provide hospice-standard care for those dying is disingenuous.  Hospices achieve their reputation because they can concentrate on what they do best.  If hospices had to take undifferentiated emergencies day and night they would not cope either.<br /><br /> If we're going down the route of changing names because of historical associations, why stop at hospices?  Let's change all the hospital names beginning with 'St.' and, while we're about it, all those beginning with 'Royal' because it could be offensive to Republicans!<br /><br /> I have no religious affiliations but, when I'm dying, I doubt that I'll worry about the beliefs of those looking after me if they're doing a good job.  One's last days are probably not the ones in which to make enemies!  One of the hospitals in which I did some work was run by an order of nuns.  I can honestly say it was the happiest working environment of any in which I worked and I know that was true for all other staff who included hindus and muslims.  Religion never intruded into daily hospital life; my chats with the Sister Superior always ended in her saying 'God bless you' and if that was the worst thing anyone said to me it was a very good day.<br /><br /> If particular religious communities want end-of-life care specific to their beliefs that's fine; if the need is great enough I'm sure their communities will provide it; perhaps they even have better care at home.

But still I keep on getting patiets with atypical Rheumatoid Artheritis and SLE like symptoms, where I can not put a label on this patient.Recently I had a patient, 60 yrs old; having severe pain in small and large joints, particularly in MCP and shoulder joints on both sides. He became almost crippled as he could not grip and thing and he could not pick up any thing. All investigations were negative except ESR being 45 mm, and positive for CRP. He was referred to rheumatologist. He opined that in his opinion he is suffering from Psoriasis but could not be definite. Ultimately he is taking methotrexate along with steroids and NSAIDs.What percentage of this kind of patients remains unlabelled?	ranasaleem	2011-06-23 16:39:00	0	0

49	9	1	Joint pain can be a manifestation of disorders confined to the joint and also of a number of systemic disorders. Identifying the cause of joint pain, therefore, can be difficult because of extensive differential diagnosis. In some cases the diagnosis may be hindered by atypical presentation (as in the elderly or immunocompromised), or masked in those with multiple comorbidities and / or symptoms. Consequently it’s prudent to keep the diagnosis open in patients who present with pain in multiple joints. For instance, what may begin as a monoarthritis may in course of time become polyarthritis, thereby necessitating a review of alternative diagnostic possibilities. Similarly, an elderly woman, diagnosed initially as RA, might later develop a molar rash and oral ulcer which would change the diagnosis to SLE.  A careful history and physical examination are essential which will help guide appropriate investigations and management. The most relevant aspects to decide are threefold: 1.       1 - Whether the underlying disorder is inflammatory or not. 2.     2 -Establish the type of onset (acute or otherwise), and its subsequent evolution (i.e. self-limiting, monoarticular, polyarticular symmetrical, polyarticular non-symmetrica. and  3.     3 - The presence of associated extra-articular and systemic manifestations (e.g. fever, rash, eye involvement, bowel symptoms, Raynaud’s, etc.) The majority of conditions are benign and self-limiting, but a minority (trauma, sepsis, gout) may require an urgent assessment and treatment.   Presently, in many rheumatologic disorders, applying information from various imaging modalities, such as conventional radiography, CT, MRI, arthrography, bone scintigraphy, and ultrasound within the context of the patient’s history and clinical presentation can help select the best test and lead to a reliable diagnosis, appropriate therapy, and overall better patient care with lower costs and risks.	csm@csm	2011-06-27 05:51:00	0	0
50	9	1	Hi SKerigamwelcome to this discussion. You have made a statement wich has directly gone to my heart. Everyday I am faced with these cases. I do not know how to add steroids or methotrexate in addtion to NSAIDs. Is there any accepted clinical opinion? How to be sure that this inflammatory other then signs?Welcome back CSM to my horizen!You are so right about these patietns. I have countless number of patietns who were labelled initially as Reactive Arthritis, but later on moved to other Diagnosis.Pus cells in urine (obviously  /> 10) and a foul smelling, thick infective vag discharge complicates the diagnosis in many lady patietns. Most perplexing for me is one question? How can you have inflammatory arthritis with normal ESR and normal CRP? Can you? SKerigam has got to the soul of my problem. He seems to suggest that we can? Do you think we can?Yorum !     Do you also think we can have inflammatory arthritis with normal ESR and normal CRP? This is the point I am trying to clarify for my practice.	ranasaleem	2011-06-27 07:54:00	0	0
51	9	1	It’s a common knowledge that ESR,CRP are nonspecific indicators of inflammation, not useful as screening tests for rheumatic diseases, and cannot differentiate one disease from another. Repeated studies of workup for polyarticular complaints and rheumatoid disease demonstrate many variable factors (e.g. age, gender, pregnancy, comorbid diseases, etc.) associated with CRP/ESR discordance. In many studies ESR and CRP values were modestly correlated with each other and they were weakly correlated with disease activity measures. These data suggest that another look at the role of ESR and CRP as markers of inflammation in RA patients seen in routine care may be in order.  Some studies state that it is not necessary to obtain both ESR and CRP measures for clinical disease activity assessment in clinical trials of RA. Neither test adds significantly to clinical measures of disease activity including joint counts and global assessments. Where available, the CRP alone may be preferred for disease activity assessment as a simple, validated, reproducible, non age-dependent test. In office practice, test selection is generally guided by whether the clinical assessment suggests inflammatory or noninflammatory disease. One inquires into the characteristic hallmarks of inflammation: redness, warmth, soft-tissue swelling, and tenderness. If such symptoms are localized to and encompass an entire joint, one has excellent presumptive evidence for synovitis and an inflammatory process. A good history and clues on physical examination increase the “pretest probability” by asking questions that support the diagnosis of inflammatory arthropathy or systemic rheumatic disease.  In general, although ESR / CRP can be helpful to monitor certain patients, laboratory measures cannot serve as a gold standard for diagnosis and management in all individual patients with RA or any rheumatic disease. I suppose, we (and our patients’ as well) would benefit from an improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of patients with rheumatologic disorders.	csm@csm	2011-06-27 12:40:00	0	0

Went I had a THR recently I said to the surgeon beforehand I would prefer LMWH to a NOAC and he more or less I think felt that was not now a surgical decision and would leave it to me or the hospital protocol. The hospital then said that it had changed back to LMWH in view of side effects with NOAC , so no problem there. I was then asked about a district nurse giving the injection which seemed a pretty ridiculous idea. Surely the NHS should not be funding that sort of activity unless there really is a special need ? Talk about ""nanny state"" - if an able person declines to do something as simple as that , then offer aspirin or warfarin as an alternative .... A similar problem arises with diabetics who refuse to inject themselves when otherwise quite capable.<br /><br /> Of course the real problem is the numbers on long-term antioagulation. My wife was skiing down the slopes last winter when her sister mentioned in passing that she was on a NOAC. I worry a bit that there are so many folk out there now on these that potential hazards are being belittled - particularly with a drug that is not readily reversible.

79	14	1	Dear All<br /><br /> Last week was a roller coaster of events and emotions. When I came into this job 5 months ago, I came into it because frankly I was angry at how I felt my friends, my colleagues and I were being treated. I absolutely could not stand the idea of having something being imposed upon us by a government that has no clue what it is we do.<br /><br /> Over the last 5 months I have felt like many of you in our need to moderate our language, I know that my job is not to simply represent my frustrations, but to stand up for all of our collective interests whether junior doctors or the patients we look after. JDC members are often the same, they represent the views of their regions with a passionate resolve to do the best for the doctors they have in their patch. I have seen the same from representatives across the board this year, whether they are college trainee groups or specialty organisations. I have seen junior doctor leaders put aside previous silo competitive traditions and work together in a way that none of us have seen before. One thing I hope beyond everything else is that as a profession this has a longer term effect on our generation of doctors. We will work together in a collaborative way for the good of our profession, patients and the whole NHS in a way I have not seen previously. Over the last decade I have seen the bastardisation of the concept of clinical leadership by the department of health, turning it into a method of control where professionals are trained simply to follow instructions and kept in line simply out of fear of a loss of influence or position. Last week we have seen the outcome of that agenda, when clinicians stand up for themselves, their patients and what they think is right, the answer is aggression, bullying and being effectively screamed at, that the will of a politician or a government will simply be imposed on those that disagree. So much for independent clinical leadership or professionalism.<br /><br /> On Tuesday I met with Sir David Dalton at his request. I have been clear throughout the last few months that last minute offers in general are highly inappropriate as the government has had three years to make fair offers. We have tried to talk, to negotiate in good faith. We have represented our members, but we have also been of a clear view that our members believe in a sustainable NHS. Retention of the doctors in the UK is our number 1 priority as without the talented individuals that deliver the frontline of the NHS, it is our patients that ultimately suffer. I notice in the latest HSJ article, Sir David has misrepresented that meeting and the clear view I expressed that I know I heard from many doctors throughout the NHS. We are always happy to negotiate, but a negotiation has to involve recognising both sides views and priorities. We had spent a huge amount of time and effort consulting with you our membership, looking at the stated aims of the government in terms of priorities, but also using our experiences of the frontline so solve the contractual dispute to the satisfaction of all parties. We understood compromise was necessary, however we also assumed that compromise was needed from both parties.<br /><br /> The issue regarding out of hours has been attempted to be boiled down to simply about pay. When we constructed our structure of pay, we also took into the implications and considerations of the needs of the NHS. If you simply move money into basic salary and undervalue the out of hours components of the salary structure, you create perverse incentives as the relative value of time out of hours diminishes. This has a knock on effect as it creates a driver that devalues specialties that have heavy out of hours commitments relative to others. This could have a further destabilising effect on the delivery of those services as already overstretched services become less popular due to their relative differences. Therefore we wanted to create a system of pay that valued time appropriately especially when we want to retain and recruit staff into those specialties. The issues regarding front loading and flattening of the pay scale were specifically trying to square a circle of a treasury red line of the removal of automatic pay progression from the public sector and a desire to ensure that we did not penalise or perpetuate the gender pay gap. We also wanted a system of pay that ultimately benefited the next generation of doctors that ensured that the wage inflation compared the to cost of living inflation benefitted the doctor starting out on their career and considering the debts students now qualify with. If nothing else, this structure showed our absolute attempts at addressing competing interests that many felt were insurmountable. Our structure of pay involving appropriate rewards for unsocial hours was also staff group specific. With the majority of the staff group being at a stage in life when families and childcare was inevitable. It was important that appropriate account was taken for this to try and retain highly trained staff as they balance competing interests of family life and professional responsibilities.<br /><br /> On the issues around NROC, we identified early that this was an area that was particularly of concern. We have experience of NROC on our negs team, however the full extent of the varied and diverse working structures meant we were absolutely clear we wanted to consult further on this area. However we were also absolutely clear that the government position of continuously comparing the roles of junior doctors with more senior staff where the range and types of responsibilities are different does not make sense. percentages of values that are so very different also have an impact, and where the financial barrier to rostering practices that have the potential to take advantage of junior doctors cannot be sanctioned. Again there was an absolute refusal to understand the concerns we described and the “needs of the service” were always paramount - a concept we can all sign up to if those needs are not so dangerously overstretching staff that doctors and patients are forced into dangerous situations. We suggested a proper consultation and testing of positions, however this has now obviously been rejected.<br /><br /> The experience of all negotiators over the last three years have been of negotiating partners that continuously introduce new objectives very late in the process, - 7 days services (June 2015) First refusal on medical time (January 2016) to name two, and yet cry foul if we attempt to suggest that these involve a requirement for additional resource or that they are undeliverable due to the current overstretched staff. There is also a continuous disingenuity in that compromises made are often rowed back on and so promises can never be trusted. Add to this toxic mix continuous political interference for objectives that have nothing to do with the service or patient care, but entirely focussed on soundbite politics and a constant need to look like there is a political victory to be had. You see why this whole sorry episode has been a lesson for the NHS and the medical profession in all that is fundamentally wrong with our current system. The department and NHSE in particular, fundamentally entered this whole negotiation with seemingly the attitude they had to teach the medical profession a lesson and put them in their place following previous negotiations.<br /><br /> So the contract that has been described has several aspects that are fundamentally unfair, the distribution of resource across the whole week, the first refusal on medical time, the nature of NROC, the ultimate safety mechanisms in the contract and the confidence we can have in them, the delivery of many of the mechanisms that are reliant on collaborative working, the ultimate appeals mechanisms for dangerous activity. There have been a hell of a lot of gains as a result of our attempts to outline what junior doctors do from modifying the flawed pay structure, some of the safety limits, making a fundamentally unworkable safety mechanism have some resemblance of what could work if there was any trust left in the system. However there is so much still flawed with this system. If this was about comparing what we currently do, its easy to misrepresent the situation. But its the nature of the services and distribution of staffing projecting forward and overstretching those staff that is so flawed. There is an absolute finite staffing resource. You cannot deliver a 7 day service when the current 5 days is falling apart and is dangerous.<br /><br /> Several times over this process we have tried to suggest that it’s in no ones interest to have this damaging fight, however that is not simply solved by the medical profession being “taught a lesson”. In November despite an incredible mandate, we called on the government to enter Acas to find a solution, in December despite last minute interference again to try and prevent a deal being found, we were able to find the starting point for negotiations and we stood down despite significant mistrust and strength of feeling. In January despite every attempt to find a solution to the problems we all could see, giving Sir David Dalton the space to come in and pulling more industrial action to give us all the space to find solutions, we still faced this intransigence and absolute unwillingness to compromise for political reasons. We had suggested that for the last few weeks that the whole situation has got out of hand and it would be in everyones interest to step back from the abyss and try and solve the issues of morale amongst junior doctors. Build trust back in the system and try and solve some of the educational shortcomings in the current system. Unfortunately once again machismo and political interference took precedence and rather than seeing we had one opportunity to try and stop a damaging course of events, the day after junior doctors across England go out on industrial action and feelings are elevated, the Secretary of State decides now is the appropriate time to show how deeply muscular the government is. Obviously burying bad news about waiting time figures - the first time ever that the target for routine operations has been missed, or that the departments budget has been exceeded due to massive mismanagement and requires a treasury bailout, I am sure had nothing to do with making a political announcement to destroy the last vestiges of morale in the junior doctor workforce in this country.<br /><br /> What next is what every junior doctor and the wider profession is asking? Well the government has published a very short summary of the some aspects of the contract they intend on “imposing”. We need to truly look at this and the implications. We can already see significant shortcomings that mean this proposal is not something junior doctors have stated they would sign up to. But unlike the government, the JDC and the BMA do want to actually listen to our members. Below is a list of open meetings I will be attending:<br /><br /> Monday 15th Norfolk and Norwich Hospital Mess meeting 12.30pm<br /> Monday 15th East of England RJDC, Clinical School, Addenbrookes, 7pm<br /> Tuesday 16th Bristol for joint RJDC/Bristol Divisional meeting 7pm<br /> Wednesday 17th East Midlands RJDC meeting TBC<br /> Thursday 18th South Thames RJDC - BMA House 6.30pm<br /> Friday 19th West Midlands RJDC - Birmingham Chamber of Commerce 75 Harborne Road, Edgbaston Birmingham B15 3DH 7pm<br /><br /> There are also open RJDC meetings:<br /><br /> Monday 15th Northern RJDC Royal station hotel Newcastle 6.30pm<br /> Tuesday 16th Oxford RJDC - John Radcliffe Lecture theatre 2, 6.30pm<br /><br /> We will look much more into the detail of the proposals should we get detail and look at where these will need to be challenged. We will seriously now have to consider every option available to JDC and consider what is in the best interests of our generation and the next of doctors, our wider profession, the NHS and our patients. Ultimately we cannot sit by and watch the government alienate a generation of doctors and thereby destroy the NHS we work so hard every day to make better and protect. The governments aim maybe to teach the medical profession a lesson, but in doing so they have shown their willingness and almost eagerness to destroy our NHS. The government often whispers about this as their miners moment. What happened with the mining industry? Is that what this government envisages for the NHS?<br /><br /> It is time for us all the take stock. The staff of the NHS never asked for unfair payrises, we never destroyed the financial system, we didn’t abuse our positions for personal gain. All we want is to be treated fairly and to not have the organisation we love and dedicate our lives to be destroyed by a government that puts their personal gain above the people they are supposed to represent.<br /><br /> I will say one last thing, its very easy to make this about Jeremy Hunt. But fundamentally, deep down, I think we need to squarely lay the blame at David Cameron. He has stood by and ensured that ultimately the NHS he claimed to want to protect has been systematically destroyed since being elected by attacking the very staff that sweat blood and tears trying to protect it, work for it and love it.<br /><br /> Best wishes<br /><br /> Johann<br /><br /> ps you will hear from JDC in due course….

83	15	1	Dr.polly,<br /><br /> You say you don't intend to go and work abroad, but if you firmly want this break from the training treadmill, I would urge you to do so!    I did this, rather later in my training, when such opportunities existed.  I don't think they do now, so you may not get that opportunity again.<br /><br /> I think that my experience abroad, in the Netherlands and Sweden, broadened and shaped my practice ever afterwards, to my benefit and that of my patients.     Those were ordinary hospital jobs - today, I would look to go with one of the many charities that organise medical work in the Third World, because that would expose me to completely different  facilities, techniques, and diseases.   And becasue it is so worthwhile!<br /><br /> Best wishes<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-06-08 08:39:00	0	0

90	17	1	Hello all. I'm new here.<br /><br /> I've been working as a neurologist for a private hospital in Spain for the last 5 years. My job is stable and my earnings are enough for my family of four, yet I don't feel comfortable enough to get a mortgage, for instance.<br /><br /> There's things I don't like about living in Spain (I'm an italian citizen raised in South America, BTW) and sometimes me and the wife harbor a feeling that we would be better off in the UK both environmentally and financially as well as academically (for the kids).<br /><br /> On one hand, my job here is rather great for my quality of life: My regime is M-F, no night shifts nor weekends. Alas, I know that it's a characteristic of my specific workplace and if I was terminated no other option would be as good as this one. The public system is exploiting new doctors at the moment with temporary contracts that last a day only or even less than that. Also, my gross earnings are half or less than half of a Consultant's and they're likely to remain the same.<br /><br /> I have been talking to colleagues in Spain that went to the UK for various reasons, but the only neurologist in the group had been a junior doctor in a huge hospital in London. I aim for a rather small hospital towards the north of England.<br /><br /> So, I come to the forum asking for experiences and knowledge that could be useful for me in order to make a decision, should I stay or should I go. How is a consultant's work in a normal-ish hospital, how is the work load. How is it measured. Is it true that reports must be made by dictation for a remote secretary, or are doctors allowed to type them by themselves? Are they involved in many administrative decisions? How does one get certified and recertified? Is it as draconian as in the US?<br /><br /> Thank you very much for your tips.	mipial	2016-05-09 12:42:00	0	0
91	17	1	"mipial,<br /><br /> In the Uk we should be flattered that you wish to move here, and gratfeul if you do - there is a shortage of neurologists in the NHS.<br /><br /> But please do your homework!    Houses are very expensive in the UK - prices in Spain have fallen by 35%, but risen by 25% in the UK, in the last ten years http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/price-change-10-years<br /><br /> I cannot speak for neurologists, but for NHS consultants, Hippocrates words which I have slightly adapted are true, ""Horis longa, domestica vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum pericilusum, iudicium difficile""   and add, ""pauperes sustinere""<br /><br /> You may be familiar with the English expression, ""The grass is always greener"", mipial.    Take care!<br /><br /> John"	John D	2016-05-09 16:11:00	0	0
92	17	1	"Thanks a lot for your answer.<br /><br /> Inded, house prices have risen in the UK and dropped a bit in Spain. I've been following that for some time now. The bailing-out for the banks prevented them from really plummeting in Spain, though.<br /><br /> Still, the political stability in Spain in the short range cannot be taken for granted and that keeps me from making such a long lasting investment. Not just because of the possibility of being sacked, but because my own savings could be on the stake as well (look up ""corralito"").<br /><br /> Your latins hold the details of what I'd like to know. I think most specialists here would say the same about the public system. Still, I'm at a good salary range at a gross 60k € (roughly 42k € after income tax) though living expenses may be no more than 1/3 higher in the UK than Spain (been there last summer).<br /><br /> BTW, the grass is not just greener: In the southeast of Spain -where I live- there is no grass!<br /><br /> Thanks again!<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Mipial"	mipial	2016-05-09 17:28:00	0	0

95	18	1	"Muhibatrasul,<br /><br /> As Dr.Chid suggests, the ways back into practice will depend on where you are.   In the UK, after eight years without working, undergoing appraisal and  being re-validated you will lose your registration as a doctor with the General Medical Council.   Other countries will have different rules, but it is clear that anyone after such a long time away from medicine will need to refresh their old knowledge and update themselves on new techniques and drugs.     The duration of that refreshment will depend on you.<br /><br /> You might like to read this, ""Return to practice guidance"", published by the Academy of Royal Colleges: http://www.aomrc.org.uk/doc_view/9486-return-to-practice-guidance .   It applies to the UK, but has universal advice, especially on having an ""Action Plan"" for your refreshment, and lists questions you should ask yourself and which potential employers and colleagues will ask you, to which you should have answers.   It mentions similar guidance avalilable in the US under ""physician re-entry"" (presumably from Earth orbit!).<br /><br /> If there is a professional organisation in your country, for medicine and/or anaesthesia, then I suggest you ask them about this.    They will know the local rules, and may be able to help you find a department of anaesthesia that will support your return to work.<br /><br /> The very best of luck!<br /><br /> John"	John D	2016-05-06 11:16:00	1	0

98	19	1	"Over 50k people have signed an online petition in support of a junior doctor strike in the UK.<br /><br /> This is a response to the government's plans to impose a new contract for doctors in training which is likely to increase working hours and reduce pay.<br /><br /> It is proposed that basic pay will increase but the definition of ""sociable hours"" will be changed from 0800-1900 Monday to Friday to 0700-2200 Monday to Saturday which means junior doctors will not be eligible to receive supplemental pay (non-pensionable banding supplements) for work unless it occurs outside these times.<br /><br /> From the Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration (DDRB)  paper, ""Contract reform for consultants and doctors & dentists in training – supporting healthcare services seven days a week""<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /> It is also implied that doctors on maternity, paternity or sickness leave, those working less than full time, and those without a training number would not be eligible for the annual incremental pay increases that most UK doctors currently receive. Instead, pay increases would correspond with stages of training/increases in responsibility (rather than time served or years of experience).<br /><br />  <br /><br />Kitty Mohan, co-chair of the BMA's Junior Doctors' Committee, suggests the following to juniors doctors: <br /><br /> 1. The DDRB recommendations affect different people in different ways. If you have not yet managed to do so, please do read the juniors section of the DDRB report published on 16th July.  It can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contract-reform-for-consultants-and-doctors-and-dentists-in-training-supporting-healthcare-services-seven-days-a-week<br /><br /> 2. Talk to your colleagues at work and make sure they are as informed as you. Start with other junior doctors but please do talk to other doctors, nurses and other health professionals. We are still being contacted by juniors who have no idea what is going on and if this affects them.  Let’s be clear, this affects us all.<br /><br /> 3. Talk to your medical students, this will be their future contract, and to non-medical families and friends. Encourage them to spread the words regarding the concerns as well.<br /><br /> 4. Many of your Royal Colleges may have already made a statement regarding junior contracts but please continue to lobby your College, Faculty or Royal Colleges. We’ve seen Royal Colleges both speak out strongly against the changes, and those who feel this isn’t their concern. The implications of a disenfranchised and devalued medical workforce affect everyone. Lobby your specialty trainee group as well – the more people who speak out against the changes the better.  <br /><br /> 5.  Contact your local and regional BMA junior doctors reps and tell them your thoughts on what the next steps should be. The list of the Regional Junior Doctors Committee Chairs can be found at http://web2.bma.org.uk/rjdc<br /><br /> If you are a local or regional BMA junior doctor rep, please discuss these issues with your local and regional members and canvass their views on next steps over the next few days. We want to hear from as many people as possible.  Or email Andrew and myself at jdcchair@bma.org.uk . Thank you to the many of you who have contacted us so far.<br /><br /> 6. Attend one of the NHS Employers junior doctors engagement events. Details of the events can be found at NHS Employers<br /><br /> 7. Please take to Facebook and Twitter and share your concerns. On a simple level the more voices heard, and the more concerns raised the better. It is the level of outrage by junior doctors and their supporters that has turned this into a news story. Please get involved in discussions and debates, write blogs or opinion pieces, and generally do everything you can to get out messages out there.<br /><br /> 8. Finally, whatever your opinion of the BMA is, the protection BMA membership affords regarding our terms and conditions is unparalleled.  Please remain a member or consider rejoining. This is the single biggest threat to the terms and conditions of current and future junior doctors."	Sabreena	2015-09-21 14:34:00	2	0
99	19	1	In spite of my outrage and fury, I have voted no.<br /><br /> The reason for this is that I believe that any strike will do more harm than good. During the last strike on June 21st 2012 over pension changes, it was estimated that about only eight per cent of NHS doctors took part in the protest. It was a flop and there is absolutely no point in considering this as a viable strategy again. In all honesty none of us have the stomach for a fight in this way anyway. A true strike would mean no working for all doctors and inevitably guaranteed deaths for a number of patients. A tube train driver may be able to cope with the consequences of long bus queues in London and traffic chaos, but I don't think any of us could cope with the loss of even one child dying of an asthma attack. Many would have to die to force the Government's hand and the public would never later forgive the profession for the loss of their loved ones. The stakes are too high and would lead to immediate fractures in our battle lines as colleagues either deserted abroad in horror or slunk back to work defeated, guilty and broken. There is little point therefore in threatening to engage in a battle that none of us can stomach and afterwards would make us even more vulnerable.Once one person dies, we'll all be very sorry and collapse, but without the threat of a death, we've got nothing.<br /><br /> The prize we are fighting for are millions of pounds held by a full-time professional organisation who are experienced and skilled at achieving their wishes by ruthlessly manipulating people.  What really do you think are the skill sets required to succeed as a politician? Now, do you really think a bunch of part-time amateurs with no stomach for a fight should be making threats that they will not see through as a good strategy for victory?<br /><br /> If we are going to fight, we should be almost certain that we are going to win before we deploy any of our limited amateur forces. We should be aware of our weaknesses in that we are not by nature aggressive, not by nature cohesive and not in a financial position to fight for very long.  Our opposition are aggressive, very cohesive and have a lot of money. Their weakness lies in the ballot box and their four year life-cycle. Here is the only place and time to attack them and have any chance of real victory. We should not therefore squander our energies on some futile gesture that will only disillusion our foot soldiers and make our leaders appear incompetent.	Adrian Leahy	2015-09-22 14:36:00	3	0
100	19	1	Adrian<br /><br /> I hear what you are saying, but there are ways to deal with your concerns.<br /><br /> For example, in A&E, nurses could still triage and those who are not deemed life threatening or likely to be life threatening without the intervention of a Doctor, don't get seen until after the strike.  You would need to maintain a presence in resus for obvious reasons, but that is a only a very small percentage of those who should be on strike.<br /><br /> For the other hospital specialities, any Doctors on the picket line could carry a pager.  The reason for use being clearly stated that it is only for emergencies where that specialities attendance cannot wait.<br /><br /> As for GP's...well that could be a complete strike.  Emergencies shouldn't be going to GP practices and anyone trying to circumvent the strike by going to A&E will have a very long wait!<br /><br /> It may sound simplistic, but a similar system worked when the ambulance service went on strike.  There were crews who volunteered to go to cardiac arrests and other life threatening calls whilst on strike...everything else waited.<br /><br /> The fire service are experts at going on strike and they also operate a similar system!<br /><br /> Now, if you were to tie in the day/s of your strike/s with the ambulance service, it would be even better!<br /><br />  <br /><br /> That being said, it requires people to take part.  The problem is that most people say there's no point in taking industrial action as it won't change anything.  Subsequently, ballots don't represent how people feel as most people don't vote and then when it comes to industrial action there's a poor commitment from workers!	ph80	2015-09-22 16:11:00	2	0
101	19	1	As a profession we're a bunch of cowards. We'll always find excuses not to strike. The public do not care about us and government does not care about us. What they do know is that we are our own worst enemy. <br /><br />If you ask me do I care about patient safety the answer is absolutely yes; if you ask me do I care about it more than my health and the health and future of my family the answer is absolutely not. <br /><br />When do we draw the line if not now? If the powers that be decided suddenly that we be payed £1 per day for the same hours we do now would we still play the 'patient safety' card? <br /><br />Let's consider the Fire Service strikes of the early Noughties - long story short many complained people would die due to the strikes but eventually public sympathy sided with the firefighters; the government was forced to recruit Army and RAF fire crews.

110	21	1	"Difficult question for me and one has to tease out dislike of Jeremy Hunt as an influencing factor. Yet the way it is being portrayed must lose a certain amount of sympathy for the BMA. 13.5 % (I think that is the figure) pay rise on basic pay must make many employed folk envious. Perhaps those golden contracts from many years ago making overtime payments such a large proportion of income on some contracts were inappropriate - we should have concentrated on fighting for more doctors.<br /><br /> I also think the objections to Saturday working are open to criticism - I can see how Jewish doctors might object on religious grounds- but many doctors seem prepared to work Sats if extra pay is on offer. My impression is that many folk do now work on a Saturday , even if not ""at work"" in the usual sense. My limited experience of working Saturday clinics is that they were appreciated by many patients.<br /><br /> So more and more I am coming across the impression that this strike is now about the question of money and that public support is beginning to wane. Perhaps a ""working to rule"" will be more effective than further strikes. We need some form of resolution for future planning.<br /><br /> Those doctors interviwed who talk about ""quitting medicine"" - as opposed to moving elsewhere - certainly lose much of the sympathy which I had initially. Maybe they would not be able to take the coming pressures anyway."	sken	2016-02-12 13:50:00	0	0

112	21	1	"John D - I have been awaiting events - and still am. I understand the points you make and have little (no) doubt that what is proposed is harmful and based on bad evidence. The problem is much wider than being just about  doctors. We do not have staffing levels for a week-end service , so this can only be provided at a cost to weekdays - decreasing the service during those days is of course one way of levelling out any differences.<br /><br /> Any politician aiming for a compromise could have achieved one. Trying to buy off doctors with a background offer of a large pay rise has made it look like a matter about money but missed the point in many ways. It is what politicians had already tried with waiting -list initiatives when the amounts of money for extra lists were sometimes clearly OTT. A reasonable compromise now would have been to settle for Saturday morning as a normal working time with full back-up services. <br /><br /> The reason I wonder about further strike action being of value is that I see this as disruptive and stressful for those concerned whilst fighting a battle which really needs wider involvement. The public voted in the present government knowing that week-end working was part of the plan for the NHS. This is a battle in which the public has to share. Initial support seems to be dwindling - remember how the public supported the Iraq war , then changed its mind? Our obsession with instant access is fuelling the present crisis. <br /><br /> In my time the only politician who seemed to grasp the fundamental of the medical market was Barbara Castle - create more doctors than jobs to go around. Since her day this has no longer feasible since there are now so many doctors anyway and vast numbers of ideas about how to deploy any extra. <br /><br />  Other than emotion I am not sure the public cares about the NHS quite so much as at one time nor I suspect does the media. Seeing it as a ""religion"" does not help - it leads to a belief in a permanence that may be unreal <br /><br /> One only has to look at the present campaigns on food and drink - plenty on how it affects the individual but often precious little on how it impinges on the NHS services and opportunity costs for others - other than a general assumption that the NHS will restore folk to normality.<br /><br />  Doctors may need to vote with their feet whilst they can. On our local news recently there was comment that down here in the South-East we now have the worst figures for unfilled physician posts in the country.<br /><br />   I think my views on the usefulness of continuing strike action have changed - the fight for a rational approach to NHS services is not one which the juior doctors can fight on their own. The public is about to be entertained by various showmen politicians on the European Union , together with the USA election and a number of new serials on TV. In the meaantime new contracts will begin to be imposed as rota plans for the coming months need to be in place. Not an ideal time to try to grab centre stage? <br /><br /> PS I think the proposed attempt to take legal action an alternative to strike action which I would support."	sken	2016-02-22 10:26:00	0	0
113	21	1	It might be best for the BMA to !obby Foundation Trusts about the benefits to their recruitment of offering non-Hunt contracts.   I know this would leave non-foundations in the lurch, but would place the staffing problem right back in the Gov's lap.  I fear they would just pass emergency legislation depriving Foundations of their freedom,  but that would reveal their duplicity.<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-02-22 10:53:00	0	0

119	23	1	"The UN team has spent some time weighing up the rights and wrongs of how Julian assange has been treated and on strong grounds has come to the conclusion that he should be released. As I gather he might well be anyway if the more recent relevant UK laws were applied retrospectively. UK and Sweden prefer to ignore international law.<br /><br /> The whole business seems somewhat malodorous - he is not charged with an offence under Swedish law - just ""wanted for interview"" which could easily have been carried out in the UK. The whole business seemed designed to expedite his exradition to the USA , which has a very limited view of justice in this respect and a very punitive approach to anyone who might have upset them.<br /><br /> It would be healthy for medicine and nursing  generally for whistleblowers if a conciliatory and compromise approach was adopted. Those readers of Private Eye will have seen recently - in some detail - how very critical a judge has been of the way in which the nursing hierarchy treated a whistleblower to the point of suggesting the evidence used against her was falsified her : the high court judge apparently felt ""there had been ""a crude attempt to frame her"".<br /><br /> The message that one has an obligation to whistleblow in the knowledge that doing so is likely to lead to persecution , loss of employment and be generally destructive of family life is the wrong message.<br /><br /> Of course I am not suggesting investigation into a charge of rape should be dismissed but that should be a separate issue. Currently it seems that Sweden does not have the evidence to make a charge and is not primarily interested in that aspect of the overall case. <br /><br /> PS John D - Yes , I have looked at the Guardian comments , but I think one has to view the UN jydgement as a whole."	sken	2016-02-05 13:45:00	0	0

122	23	1	I don't think Assange is a good example to use of whistleblowing. Wikileaks released en masse classified documents without being in a position to know what the repercussions might be. Whilst I too have concerns about government secrecy and conduct some degree of secrecy is essential for military, defence, commercial and diplomatic reasons. Assange aims to make governments more transparent but he doesn't regard transparency of his own conduct as being fair. He refuses to say who funds wikileaks, where it is based etc. Whilst we may have concerns about the conduct and policies of our governments at least in democracies governments are elected and there are checks and balances regarding what should be private and what should be for public consumption. Assange is self appointed and has decided he knows best what classified information should be available to be read by foreign intelligence agencies and hostile governments. It may well be that analysts advising governments are more reluctant to be frank with their opinions because they fear reading about themselves on the internet. It is telling that he only releases information about the US military and not about Russian or other countries that might worry us. It is also ironic he - as an investigative journalist - sought sanctuary in the Ecuadorian embassy, a country usually quite content to ensure their own journalists are muzzled and mistreated.<br /><br /> He seems to think that he is exempt from the law. He has had his case heard right up to the Supreme Court and without exception they have all ruled against him. The Swedish courts have also followed due process and issued a European Arrest Warrant. He fled bail and voluntarily went into a Diplomatic limbo (a flagrant abuse of Diplomatic Immunity - you cannot just declare a non national a diplomat of your nation).  He can leave at any time hence the UN ruling is quite bizarre. The UN panel is not a court and does not have that authority nor is its opinion legally binding. People keep saying that Assange has not been charged with anything only wanted for questioning. You cannot charge anyone with an offence unless and until you have arrested them, hence the EAW. Assange was a frequent visitor to Sweden and only decided their legal system could not be trusted when he was accused of rape. Sweden has an excellent legal system which could certainly teach Ecuador a great deal about justice. The offences he is accused of are very serious and his alleged victims have rights just as Assange does. The irony is that it will be much harder to extradite him from Sweden to America than from  the UK. He would be able to exercise his rights against extradition like any other citizen. It is quite wrong that an alleged criminal should dictate how he wants the legal system to operate. I think Assange and his lawyers know full well he is abusing the legal process because they have not petitioned The European Court of Human Rights. That is the court which might make a difference but they know there is no mileage in any such petition.<br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2016-02-06 13:40:00	0	0

125	23	1	I can't see how this can end.  Both the UK and Sweden are bound to consider extradition to the US (Mysteriously it doesn't seem to apply in the other direction, at least for the UK).  The US is never likely to drop its wish to get Assange there, in which event he will undoubtedly disappear for a very long time.<br /><br /> I'm not quite sure why the US hasn't simply asked the UK to extradite Assange there.  Perhaps the three countries involved have calculated that public opprobrium would be less in Sweden if he could first be charged and perhaps convicted there for rape.  Sweden is reportedly not allowed to say it wouldn't extradite Assange.  Neither presumably is the UK although I've read that extradition from Sweden would require permission from the UK as well.  I guess that could be hushed up or made opaque.<br /><br /> Extradition and rendition seem different to me only insofar as the latter is unlawful and the Government, of the country from which the person is kidnapped, can pretend they didn't know anything about it.  Ring any bells?<br /><br /> It's all too easy for Governments to say they support whistleblowing whilst making exception for anything that might embarrass politicians or expose lies.  I don't know, and would never be allowed to know, whether Wikileaks has been of net benefit or harm to the public but it seems to me what we need is the sort of perfect lie-detecting software that would be applied to all public pronouncements by politicians.  The sort of device for which its inventor had to be murdered in the 'entirely fictional' drama 'London Spy'.

It seems crazy that junior drs completeing their GP training suddenly find themselves without sick/maternity/paternity pay when they apply for GP jobs. Also older GP's may wish to work but not as partners and again find themselves without basic contract supports despite working in the NHS all their career. This needs urgent action there is no reason why a salaried contract could not run alongside partnerships.

128	24	1	Thank you for all you are doing Johann.<br /><br />I'm a GP, I'm VERY fearful for recruitment and the long term effects all this is going to have. I have seen a good practice just sell out to virgin care because they couldn't cope with the increase in demand. I myself became very disillusioned in mainstream GP where I had a post as a salaried in view to eventual partnership. It wasn't for me, I wished to work with deprived communities and found I was struggling to keep my head above water in terms of patients' increasing demands and expectations of a service that does not have the funding. I found myself not practicing with passion and instead, just practicing for the sake of it. I now work as a GP for a not for profit organisation for the homeless. I am sacrificing my NHS pension in order to practice in an area that allows me to remain passionate about medicine and my every day practice. But I fear for the rest of general practice and what is to become of the system. It can't cope as it stands. I know things will get worse, and I feel helpless in what can be done. Even if contracts improve, there will be a richochet effect and we will struggle to overcome this. We are struggling now. Although the march was good, I found myself quite deflated following it. I sat on the tube with a group of 'junior' anaethatists who'd come down from the midlands and they were so low about their situation and the prospects of the future. What can I do?

The figure given in one of your references from some years ago is $500 million per year for the USA.<br /><br />  What are the absolute numbers for more aggressive intervention over traditional involvement - again looking at 1 year survival  not just short term ? These days just looking at survival to hospital discharge is not enough.<br /><br /> Many of the studies seem to assume a 100% death rate without CPR - are we sure that is valid ?

Some time ago in the UK a sudden death used to be seen as one of the better ways of leaving this world and this emphasis on prevention with CPR in almost every situation is a relatively recent cultural phenomenon.<br /><br /> I think one needs to be very wary about seeing chest compression as lousy - perhaps not ideal but a negative approach is a pretty major disincentive . I was not entirely clear whether other factors were relevant for those small numbers receiving AED in the study quoted - such as greater skill in those involved in the CPR attempts.<br /><br /> My worry is that we may be heading for every home to be equipped for full CPR - starting with those seen at most risk and with those who can afford it - and it is the effect of this on the psyche which I find particularly interesting.

137	25	1	John D - Many thanks. I will have to work my way throught he references , but UK lags the world is I suggest a very limited geographical world. Do we have figures for say the big populations - China , India . Perhaps not Africa. The endstage of CKD perhaps involves 80 times as many patients in achieving my 1 year survival yardstick. <br /><br /> My main concern - what can be done is not necessarily what should be done is more of a philosphical question and I am not sure how far it can be resolved. The USA figures have also to be seen in the context of a different attitude to health care and one where there  are even bigger Society issues when it comes to matters of life and death. <br /><br /> Incidentally , I think in the case of remote villages there is a place for some form of on site emergency care of this type. Whenever I hear of some residents living in the vicinity of our local hospital whing about their parking problems I lose sympathy. Their survival times would be pretty good compared to mine and just what did they expect when they moved there? Our village may not be remote by Welsh standards , but with poor phone , internet and GPS , no road names or house numbers being lost is a fact of life for those trying to find a given house.... but  I promise to to whine as well if I expire waiting for the emergency services and as the years roll by might come to see this as a positive advantage of relative isolation.	sken	2015-12-17 21:04:00	0	0
138	26	1	"Golly - I had a recent blg on the juxtaposition of some of my hobby horses in the news in the last couple of weeks , when the new editionof the JRSM * has just arrived with another one.<br /><br /> The article looks at perceptions and recall of consent for regional anaesthesia compared with those for surgery.<br /><br /> Essentially there were the results one might expect with a difference in how patients regarded the relevance of the 2 consents and in recall , but perhaps not quite so dramatic as one might have expected. There is still massive misunderstanding by patients about the purpose of consent with 50% believing the main purpose is as regards potential litigation and 60% that they could not withdraw consent once the form had been signed.<br /><br /> My own experiences with regional anaesthesia is that the problem rests in large part with the anaesthetist. For a brachial block I met the anaesthetist whilst waiting to be anaesthetised just outside the theatre and discussion was minimal - in the end there was a problem with access and he chose to anaesthetise me first. For my spinal I met the anaesthetist on the ward just before being taken to theatres. There was almost no discussion as I was clearly being ""processed"" as part of a list. Perhaps what is needed is an anaesthetic nurse or equivalent - my own anxieties related on both occasions more to the anaesthetic than to the surgery and I was fortunate in knowing how to inform myself about the procedures beforehand. <br /><br /> Over the years we have have had vast numbers of papers pointing out that doctors don't talk to patients when of course that it just how many of us spend our lives. I suspect here that the problem in large part relates to talking to patients at the wrong time.<br /><br /> Interestingly , in the past few days I went to a talk on laparoscopic colectomy - even in the best hands not quite as good as some feel. There was no mention about the anaesthatic challenges which led to my question about these. Far , far from straightforward and I was impressed just how aware of them was the surgeon - but perhaps the same wider knowledge is needed by all those referring for a surgical oinion if not in detail at least in outline ?

141	26	1	"John D - I should have made it more obvious that when I referred to deaths concentratig the mind , it was the minds of patient's to which I referred. I think anaesthetists are all too aware of the problems of anaesthesia but the public takes its safety too much for granted at times.<br /><br /> I think the area where we really do need more data is on the late sequelae of anaesthesia in general hospitals. This is particularly relevant where the elderly are concerned but such studies would be challenging to organise. <br /><br /> ""Injury to the larynx following intubation occurs in one-third of all patients"" ; the opening sentence in one of my journals this week. So folk should be warned. But it is the poorly documented late effects  effects that concern me most - just how would anaesthetists know about these if they are real risks. i would reckon I have had at least 2 in my own experience but one just does not see the anaesthetist again to discuss them. Gerontologists are I think becoming increasingly aware of the possible deterioration in the elderly who have borderline brain function and where minor further disability may have considerable social effects.<br /><br /> I note Duane's point and still remember a patient where I explained that what I was about to do could kill her , as was my routine with some of the riskier procedures. Her response ? A very positive ""Good"" . Some patients are better prepared for heir demise that their doctors.<br /><br /> And there is always the problem of knowing just which anaesthetist to choose when faced with a choice. Interestingly  , locally , in 3 separate conversations , the same name came up from a surgeon , physician and another anaesthetist...<br /><br /> PS The problems for the anaesthetist with these laparoscopic procedures are multiple."	sken	2015-12-05 18:02:00	0	0

What's your favourite paper or research project of all time? I'll start it off with my own- Julian Tudor Hart's 'The Inverse Care Law' (1971, The Lancet). I think it's a perfect example of a simple, important idea, and some clever research that has had far-reaching implications. The conclusions in the paper are still as relevant today as they were over 40 years ago.	b.oneill	2013-02-04 13:43:00	0	0

Laemmli, published in 1970 in the Journal of Nature. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding, by Marion M.

Conversely, to be surprised, there are more examples of ‘fraudulent’ research, which had mislead the whole medical fraternity and lost the eternity, merely for the poor commercial interests. Try to ‘google’ the phrase and you will find a numerous fraudulent research papers, published in even the most prestigious journals.

Marshall on Hp ranks highly with me not so much because of its world shattering effects , but because a) It provided an answer relevant for a common disease and b) it unveiled an answer to which clues had been been present for years but we did not think laterally - an eye opener for those of us who thought we were not biassed and blinkered. <br /><br /> Of course there have been papers with greater importance for mankind but in assessing ""best"" there should be more than just that - unravelling the human genome is good solid work but for me that type of pains taking worthy slogging away lacks the flair of  ,say , Watson and Crick's original helix description. Worthy - often phenomenally worthy - slogging is also a term I would use for some of the vast multicentre double blinded trials that have emerged over the past 50 years. And the end paper is often just building and confirming what has gone before ; again highly worthy but (for me) missing that flair making it great.<br /><br /> For the medical profession the papers on Willowbrook (hepatitis) and Tuskagee (syphilis) are also relevant as they emphasise how narrow the dividing line can be between what could be accepted in the West and some of what happened under Hitler."	sken	2015-09-23 10:35:00	0	0

155	30	1	"I like the idea of doctor as ""decision aid"". As a profession we have a deep-seated aversion to giving up our perceived power base. To some extent this has been patient driven by their refusal to take responsibility for their share of any decision , but times could be changing. Bearing in mind that how the evidence is presented will influence how it is perceived - particularly as regards risk - we need to learn how to be neutral rather than portraying a point of view. We also need to stop wasting time over those areas where the significance of the decision is pretty minimal - option appraisals on borderline indications for statins are a good example. <br /><br /> Perhaps one approach might be to offer sheets on the lines of the BMJ ""Head to head"" reviews as well as a Google recommendation. Folk seem quite capable of researching the pros and cons of , say , a new car depending on their needs and requirements , so why not be prepared to let go our control where these decisions really are of borderline medical significance with no clear right or wrong?<br /><br /> There are 2 extremes. Firstly , the decisions where the evidence is clear enough and some. pressure has to be brought to make a ""right"" decision (eg polio immunisation) . Secondly , there are a few patients unable to or who refuse to .take these decisions. Delegation of the decision to the doctor will need to be documented as this delegation is still a form of patient decision which carries some responsibility on the part of the patient. We should perhaps assume the public has a certain degree of computer literacy rather than acting like old style doctors who felt that literacy of any sort resided primarily with the medical profession"	sken	2015-04-14 14:41:00	3	0
156	30	1	"I'm glad to clarify. I was actually suggesting that people should go straight  to Google and not via a doctor to make a decision about whether to take a statin for primary prevention. It isn't a futile quest because if you Google ""statin decision aid"" you will come up with three good ones in the first ten. There is an Option Grid comparing the benefits and harms of dietary change, activity and statins, and also the NICE and Mayo Clinic tools, which incorporate full risk scores and graphical information about absolute risk figures. I think Sken is right: these figures will show people how different statin-taking is from polio vaccination, which gives 100% protection and protects others at the same time. Statins confer no benefit at all on most of those who take them, even for secondary prevention.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> If the Evidence Live meeting illustrated one thing it was how futile it is to ask doctors for their advice on this particular subject. The ""experts"" ranged in the debate gave hugely different personal opinions about benefits and potential harms. The fact is that their opinions don't matter: it needs to be an individual choice, informed by the actual evidence. My own view is that these drugs should be available free and without prescription to anyone who wants them after making an informed decision. Free because there may be a societal advantage in preventing overall levels of cardiovascular disease (despite personal margins that most individuals would think worthless); but without prescription because a doctor need not be involved at all, except to be informed so that they can deal with adverse effects or potential drug interactions.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In summary: for symptomless people taking preventive measures, there is no need to involve a doctor. There is a need for clear honest individualised information which is fully understood - and this applies to screening too, though screening is mostly detection rather than prevention. Pharmacovigilance is usually done better by computers and/or pharmacists than by doctors. It is when people are ill and find options hard to understand or decide on that doctors need to be the decisions aids: it's our job. We shouldn't be distracted from it by spending so much of our time with the worried well, still less by worrying the well."	Richard Lehman	2015-04-15 19:13:00	2	1
157	30	1	Richard<br /><br /> I’m grateful for your clarification on what you actually said; in particular that you were talking primarily about prevention in asymptomatic patients and that you were advocating the use of on-line decision aids bypassing GPs or other clinicians.<br /><br />  I’m intrigued by your suggestion that doctors are useless as sources of advice because they are offering opinions and that patients can better make informed choices by simply assessing the evidence.  If I remember rightly, EBM was supposed to blend evidence with clinical judgement. <br /><br /> The decision-aids you mention are very good at explaining the implications of trial results but do we really believe that trial results on populations are necessarily enough to help individuals decide whether to take a drug for many years? To their credit, the decision-aids stress that prediction for individuals can be impossible.  We can say with considerable certainty how an average number will behave but not individuals.                                                                                                                 <br /><br />   The decisions we make are influenced by multiple conscious and unconscious factors.  Sometimes, as in the measles vaccination affair, the decisions can be swayed (rightly or wrongly) by influences that fly in the face of ‘the evidence’.  People with capacity have every right to make their own decisions even if they appear capricious to others but they might deserve more help than ‘go do the math’.  The responsibility of individuals to the health of the herd is a separate complex dilemma which is currently playing out in Australia.<br /><br /> There are several problems in simply referring patients to the literature:<br /><br /> 1) Calculating the risk requires information for which a patient will need clinical help unless we are saying that all patients should buy sphygmomanometers and get laboratory tests done privately.  Many patients with type 2 diabetes are unaware of it.  Are we really saying the clinicians involved at that stage should not offer any guidance beyond referral to the internet?  The decision aids actually state that they should be used in conjunction with clinical consultation.<br /><br /> 2) Publication bias and, more worryingly, suppression of information can reduce the validity of decision aids, particularly in the information about unwanted effects.<br /><br /> 3) Uncertainty is at the heart of clinical practice and we shouldn’t always afford numbers special privilege when making difficult decisions particularly where, as you say, the risks and benefits are finely balanced.  Whitehead put it clearly in his Introduction to Mathematics.  “There is no more common error than to assume that, because prolonged and accurate mathematical calculations have been made, the application of the result to some fact of nature is absolutely certain.”                        Although opinions differ widely, dialogue remains important, even if only to check understanding and reasoning.<br /><br /> 4)  The sources of advice on-line are nearly endless.  Presumably someone’s opinion will have to come into play when recommending the ones to believe.  Left to their own devices patients could spend so long on-line that they might at least never take the drugs!<br /><br /> I actually agree with you about the lack of worth of statins in this group.  I wouldn’t take them and, despite the worrying number of studies decrying the value of diet and exercise, my unworthy opinion is that these drugs are vastly overused.  The irony is that the medical profession is locked in endless wrangling about these drugs and yet the guidance on-line seems to ignore this.<br /><br /> I disagree with your suggestion but it’s a very valuable one for stimulating debate about the many facets of this whole business.

168	32	1	Next week I’ll be putting my head above the parapet and giving a couple of short talks at Evidence Live. One of them will be about how we try to fit patients to the evidence and the outcomes we want: it is so much simpler than seeing how much of the evidence actually applies to each individual and corresponds with the outcomes they want. My illustration will be heart failure. The median age of patients is 76 or more, they have other illnesses—including whatever caused their heart to fail—they are tired and scared. They know they are going to die, most probably from pulmonary oedema, and many of them have experienced how distressing and protracted that can be. The majority would rather have better symptom relief than a longer life. And they want a place of comfort and safety when they die, not rushed treatment in a noisy ward where they are just another old person with HF. One way to tackle this would be to provide them with patient centred disease management at home, and this was the laudable aim of John Rumsfeld’s PCDM trial reported in JAMA here. But the terse conclusion reads: “This multisite randomised trial of a multifaceted HF PCDM intervention did not demonstrate improved patient health status compared with usual care.” It is laudable that the authors chose this as their primary outcome measure and stuck with it. Had mortality been the criterion, this trial would have been a success. And levels of depression were significantly lower in the intervention group. Let’s build on this great work and see if we can do better. We owe it to these millions of people ending their lives in distress.	Richard Lehman	2015-04-08 15:38:00	1	0

170	34	1	"In his BMJ column, Des Spence makes the statement that evidence-based medicine is broken because pharma companies have realised that to be part of the guideline making process (which can include the use of their drugs) evidence is required. Most evidence or research conducted is funded by the pharma companies. There may be no other alternative system but further scrutiny from those who publish guidelines (NICE, Cochrane) is being requested to look a conflicts of interest not only of the funding of the trials but also who is conducting the trials and for what reason. Here's an extract:<br /><br /> ""without so called “evidence” there is no seat at the guideline table. This is the fundamental “commissioning bias,” the elephant in the room, because the drug industry controls and funds most research. So the drug industry and EBM have set about legitimising illegitimate diagnoses and then widening drug indications, and now doctors can prescribe a pill for every ill. The billion prescriptions a year in England in 2012, up 66% in one decade,2 do not reflect a true increased burden of illness nor an ageing population,3 just polypharmacy supposedly based on evidence. The drug industry’s corporate mission is to make us all sick however well we feel.4 As for EBM screening programmes, these are the combine harvester of wellbeing, producing bails of overdiagnosis and misery."" http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g22"	mbillingsley	2014-01-10 12:48:00	0	0
171	34	1	In statistics they say 'torture the data and it will confess'. Transparency of study methodology and doctors' sharp skills in critical appraisal are safe-guards against Bias-Based Medicine.  Any guidelines should delineate the concepts of efficacy, effectiveness on one hand; cost-effectiveness, availability and pharma-funded guidelines on the other hand.  It is OK to say that drug X is best for disease Y, but we are using Z because it is available, cheaper or funded, let the doctors learn what they are doing.<br /><br /> How many good drug faded out and died, becuase their companies are no longer interested in producing them as their patency ended. OTC Vitamins, tonics and other food supplements are excellent examples of marketing. People who complain of 'nothing' buy them to prevent them from getting 'something'.	Sidhom	2014-01-10 16:30:00	0	0

And it can be better than something else already available, but it simply did not even get to the phase where it can be tested by EBM tools.<br /><br /> The other problem lies in the fact that once someone has invested large sums for developing something, if it turns out to be not that effective, financially it would be a ""bitter pill"" to swallow, so there is a risk of trying to ""play"" with data so it fits EBM criteria and be a ""success"".<br /><br /> Then, something can be successful, but there is something else no less successful, so again finances get in the way of science and science can be ""bended"".<br /><br /> What I say is that strong regulation and control by ministry of health and/or some other body such as the State ombudsman are needed to look after what is going on. Mainly in the sense of taking care that the game is fair and all get chances.

182	36	1	I recently attended Evidence 2013, a conference all about evidence-based medicine in Oxford. One of the topics that kept cropping up was ‘guidelines’ and how they sometimes are not as evidence-based as they should be. Sabreena has written a post about this recently – are guidelines there to be challenged? Is it too time-consuming to always challenge them? Do you have implicit faith in those who write them? How often do you challenge them? Under what circumstances?	mbillingsley	2013-03-27 14:56:00	0	0
183	36	1	If guidelines are written using gold-standard methodology and backed up by top grade evidence then it's not really about faith and you will have a hard time in a court of law explaining why you ignored them. If that is not the case then yes, of course, it would be reasonable to challenge the guideline - but only if you have evidence which is just as good or better for the alternative course of action you propose to take.As I have said here before professional freedom is NOT the freedom to do the wrong thing.	skyesteve	2013-03-27 15:31:00	0	0

188	36	1	Some guidelines are excellent and undoubtably, some guideline recommendations have saved lives.on the other hand.............Increasingly guidelines are being issued for diseases with a poor evidence base. Such guidelines are composed primarily of grade D evidence and represent only the opinions of a group of individuals invited on to a guideline panel. The recommendations may be good, but can also be seriously wrong.It is not too long ago that the British Thoracic Society Interstitial lung disease guideline gave a (weak) recommendation to triple therapy with Azathioprine, prednisolone and N-acetylcysteine. The subsequent PANTHER trial showed that this treatment was associated with a higher mortality than placebo. The experts are not always right, and there should be fewer recommendations based on Grade D evidence and more acknowledgement of uncertaintly in guidelines.I agree though, in general, guidelines are a very good thing.

If you have not used guidelines in first hand, you know what to expect and what will happen to your career!Hence, question often but it has to be always first in first hand.

199	37	1	Thanks Steve. All great resources, many of which we include in slides in our presentations and actively encourage students to read. I also got my hospital library to order in Bad Pharma by Ben Goldacre and asked a friend to do the same at the university medical school library. Unfortunately, many students have been so put off by dull evidence-based med talks in 1st and 2nd year that the idea of reading around the subject isn't at all appealing. I also don't know how many students do actually read all the books listed under 'compulsory reading' in their curriculum - I know I certainly didn't read every single one, there's just too much to cover. I suggest making Ben's fantastic TED talks 'compulsory watching'.  I really do challenge any EBM teacher to manage to cover the amount that Ben G covers in his 15 minute TEDs, just as clearly and passionately as he does. Alternatively, they could just start showing interesting talks/interviews like these during their lectures.I also think that in medical school ethics teaching we spend a lot of time learning about Beauchamp & Childress' 4 principles, we have debates about euthanasia, abortion, end of life care etc....but when do we learn about publication bias, research misconduct and the harmful effects of drug promotion? These tend to only be taught if there happens to be a lecturer in the university who is particularly passionate about these issues. And even then, these lecturers have to fight to get the time to teach this in an already over-loaded medical curriculum. This needs to change. Just some of my thoughts!

209	39	1	Agree with Joey- it depends on the quality of the evidence. Sometimes it isn't there and then what do you do? Even NICE accepts expert opinion is a form of evidence. But people mean different things by evidence and certainly you should start with Cochrane reviews but these will only answer a small number of questions and maybe not in your patients because trials are so selective that you will be hard pushed to find people like our patients who have co morbidities. Then the evidence often doesn't contain enough information to tell you how to do it. No doctors likes to practice cook book medicine as early opponents of EBM used to call it but as a patient I would want to know my doctor was up to date and careful. EBM Is great when it is there but it is limited in its relevance and scope still.However who is going to say they practice non evidence based medicine?	DrTS	2011-09-08 22:58:00	0	0

213	39	1	"Another at least ""strange"" issue with some clinical trials happen when patients that are less likely to respond to a certain treatment strategy or to a new drug are just excluded.in the highly publicised ACCORD type 2 diabetes clinical trial for high cardiovascular risk diabetics, the following patients were excluded:Older than 79 years, Chronic Kidney Disease above stage 2, proteinuria higher than 1.0 gram/day, severely hypertensives, and severely dyslipidemics. And even with a short follow-up it was concluded that intensive blood pressure control is not worthy neither for cardiovascular outcomes (a ""combined end-point""), neither for progression of retinopathy. But intensive BP control was good for fatal and non-fatal Stroke prevention (in this trial just a ""secondary outcome"").Would you agree or apply to your clinical practice these conclusions?All Best,Joey"	Joey Rio	2011-09-17 20:20:00	0	0

216	41	1	Hi allWe've teamed up with @nhssm to explore whether the interactive nature of social media  genuinely changes the way in which we exchange and share health messages  and what role health professionals, health organisations, the media and  public sector bodies can play in disseminating real-time information  during a flu pandemic.Here's the first blog about it: http://nhssm.org.uk/the-bmj-and-nhssm-team-up-to-run-a-fluscenario/The idea is that we will publish a blog everyday until the 13th June, with new snippets of information, as this hypothetical flu virus unfolds. In the process we are asking you some questions about how you would respond in terms social media communication. You can write your responses below the blog post.

218	41	1	Hi,From the 19th November to the 10th December, University of Dundee are running a modified version of the #fluscenario during their first year Respiratory block. We're very grateful to Alex Talbott and Dr Chloe Selwood for allowing us to modify and use their material.During the scenario, we are encouraging the students to use Twitter to engage with the process, using the same hashtag of #flluscenario.We would be delighted if anyone else wants to get involved, to help guide the student thinking, and maybe learn something new along the way!

221	41	1	Generally, I would regard any official informatiion as extremely suspect but would use the evidence of the hospital carpark to tell me what is happening: when the pathology yard is closed off with a tarpauline and a sign saying civil emergency you know that the mortuary is full and they have hired a refrigerated lorry trailer for the overspill. That is very good evidence that the death rate is way in excess of official claims [as happened 2 years ago].  You really know when things are going bad when the JCB's are parked at the entrance to the allotments next to the hospital so they can dig the plague pits - and if the histopathologists arrived armed with chain saws then it really is time to panic...

226	43	1	We will be assessing the way social media has been used in the past by health authorities, doctors, nurses and patients, to spread messages during epidemics.    Notably, we are interested in social media’s role to spread reliable information to at-risk groups, but also its potential to spread misinformation. We want to explore the following areas:     How has social media been used in previous epidemics to reach at-risk groups/spread health messages? (How have health authorities and doctors used it? What have patients used it for?) What’s the psychology behind social media? Does it compel users to help each other? Recommendations on how social media be used to spread relevant information more effectivelyHow can social media be used to get different health professionals (doctors, nurses, etc) to communicate with each other and share infromation/advise patients? What are its limitations?    We will be posting on the next few months to gauge opinion and will be working with @nhssm who conduct a few Twitter chats, a blog, and scenario exercise, to explore the answers to some of these questions and find out how social media could be used by health professionals in the future to improve communication and disemminate reliable information.	mbillingsley	2012-04-20 09:17:00	0	0
227	43	1	I think social media is a good to way to promote ways to find information but not good ways to actually present information. I think social media in its core is actually about that. So many times people are simply posting links to curious pictures of whatever the latest justin bieber slag or funny quote instead of having the quote there on the site.Furthermore, I think social media has so much risk of being abused that it is risky that information placed on social media couldn't likewise be abused.Hence what I think social media should be used for is promotion.

229	43	1	There appears no effective & better way than the social media to communicate important healthcare related messages during epidemics.We have had a good result in the past using the social media as an effective way to mass communication.Psychologically people tend to follow mass or large scale media instructions.It is beyond any doubts that the social media be involved in mass communication programs.Also the social media, with help of the advanced communication methods can be able to achieve a good co-ordination between all the healthcare personalities.& help to share views of each other.The limitations may sometimes be concerned with lack of technically detailed knowledge.

231	45	1	The GMC have drafted some new guidance on how doctors should use social media. http://www.gponline.com/News/article/1128299/gmc-consults-guidance-gps-using-facebook-twitter/For me, whilst it is important to provide guidelines, I am concered that all discussion of the potential uses of social media in healthcare are being bogged down by issues to do with professionalism, reputation, confidentiality etc. Whilst I full acknowledge these are important issues, there seems to be s a lack of balance.There is a small but committed band of healthcare professionals dedicated to exploring the uses of social media in healthcare, but for me the majority of what I see discussed about doctors and social media seems to be dominated by largely bureaucratic or technical issues. Should there be more creative thinking in how we can use social media in healthcare? (E.g. public health engagement, disemmination of information for patients etc?) 'Social' media implies that it is a social tool, and perhaps doctors want to use it purely for social use, but seeing that how many people use Twitter as a news source, surely the health profession should harness it more widely?	mbillingsley	2012-04-24 17:02:00	0	0

235	46	1	BMJ Group and doc2doc are involved in a European Commission project called TELL ME, which is looking into communication techniques used during public health crises.  TELL ME stands for Transparent communication in Epidemics: Learning Lessons from experience, delivering effective Messages, providing Evidence) and is a 36 month Collaborative Project, which aims to provide evidence and to develop models for improved risk communication during infectious disease crises. TELL ME combines public health, social sciences, behavioural sciences, political sciences, law, ethics, communication and media, in order to develop original communication strategies regarding complicated messages and advice based on uncertainties, also addressing vaccine-resistant groups You can read more about the project on the website: http://www.tellmeproject.eu/   doc2doc’s involvement in the project is to write a report on the use of social media during public health crises, as well as put together a guidance document for health professionals with the goal to increase vaccine uptake in at-risk groups/vaccine resistant groups, and to coordinate the publication schedule for the whole project.    Being an online community network, we would really like to get doc2doc users involved in this project, as well as non members too. Seeing that one of the reports is on social media (or new media), it seems only right that we consult online communities and draw upon your vast array of experience and knowledge, to produce a well-informed and engaging report.	mbillingsley	2012-04-20 09:14:00	0	0

263	55	1	Depends on where you are....if you are chillaxing in a first world country, then go to a third world country......you might not want to wind up there eventually but you need to see how medicine handles the other side. Or if you are just looking for a medical experience and nothing else, then go where it is top notch eg: USA....... but if you want an overall experience of people, places and medicine, then you should go for something you've never imagined finding yourself in.<br /><br /> I had a choice between the UK (St. George's, UoL), Singapore (NUS) and India (CMC) and I chose India because I wanted an experience. Loved the medical bit, got traumatized/enlightened by the poverty (places and people bit)  bit.....if I could do it all over again, I'd still choose it.

264	55	1	Thanks John, Maxim, Poltor, Oddyseus and KK Muneer!! Awesome perspectives.<br /><br /> Basically, I would love to experience medicine in a different country! Though of Pakistani decent myself, hardly been to pakistan! Let alone experienced medicine there so thought it would be a good idea to reconnect and see what it's like there.<br /><br /> Hopefully going with a mate though, and he's not too fond of the idea. The worlds our oyster, as they say, but would love to maximise the opportunity; he wishes to go somewhere like south africa to see real poverty and make a difference (difference to his point of view and perhaps difference to them!)<br /><br /> So still deciding! <br /><br /> Didnt' realise it would be so difficult.

273	58	1	I teach medical students and because of the way the placement works I end up spending alot of time with students. I have had several students who have have felt low or scared and 1 student who I think was depressed. Most of the time a listening ear is enough but it would have been nice to offer these students more from the university so that they felt more supported. In the end I did what I could but had to ask them to see their  own GP and asked if them if I could discuss the issues with the med school. In the case of the student who was depressed the med school were supportive but could not offer very much.I wish there was more support available.	charlie	2012-10-29 13:49:00	0	0
274	58	1	After coming across this blog I had to register and comment on this. I can relate to this in more ways than I can explain. My years as an undergraduate were almost never-ending and on the brink of breakdown I found the support of a very helpful councillor at my university. She helped me et through the last two years where i felt i could no longer continue and quit. <br /><br /> Looking back i am unable to imagine i would ever be where i am today, having travelled various international countries, done humanitarian work after working for the NHS for a decade I finally decided to come back to the UK and start fresh. I now have a great job as an online doctor doing remote prescriptions for a UK based online doctor i earn well and live a easy life with hours to suit me.<br /><br /> I also volunteer at my old university to mentor some students and feels great to give back to the community. my best advice for people in such circumstances is to find a mentor you can relate to, use the services available around your university, those people are really there to help and firmly believe that it gets better, if i can survive and end up in a happy comfortable job then i am sure everyone else can.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Dr S.Malik <br /><br /> Senior online doctor for www.drfelix.co.uk<br /><br />I have never had such a serious issue during my training but have had certain times i've needed understanding advice and help from my uni.  The uncompassionate/unhelpful responses i've had from staff in these situations makes me fear for those who really need them.

275	58	1	Welcome Dr.Felix!   Thank you for contributing on such a sensitive topic!<br /><br /> I hope I wasn't lucky as a student, first to never suffer from depression and then to be at a school where we were expected to register with the school's own GP, who then adressed us more than once on the problems of the student.   He (for in those days it was a he) said that mental problems were not likely but that he and his staff were there to help.  If I had had a problem, I would have felt confident is asking for that.   I hope that other schools today are as positive.<br /><br /> For doctors in general, and at all stages of their careers are as likely to have mental problems as any group, and to be as vulnerable to the stress of the job.   Today we are becoming more willing to admit it.    Personal stories of encounters with psychiatry appear more and more often in the medical press.   In Anaesthesia News this month (June 2015) , Dr.Zoe Turner of the Mersey Deanery couragously wrote about her own post-natal depression, and her difficulty in admitting to herself that she was depressed, and not 'just tired'.   Hers was a dangerous  and ultimately successful journey, that as yet is not available online at http://www.aagbi.org/publications/anaesthesia_news/2015 but no doubt will be soon.<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-06-17 11:46:00	0	0
276	58	1	As someone who convenes a medical school course, I can say that a massive part of what we do is support students in difficulty, and difficult students.  10% of our student cohort will have a mental or physical health problem over the 5 years.  We have many students have enduring mental illness, some quite severe.  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> A question that we face a lot is whether students are falling out of the course because they can't cope with their mental illness, or whether the medical course is making their mental illness worse.  We must not discriminate against students with mental illness, but sometimes there comes a point where putting students back into a high pressure environment is not in their best interests.  This happens infrequently.<br /><br /> The majority of students with mental health issues require some time, support, and compassion, and they make it through.

277	58	1	I am a GP in Dublin with a big interest in nutrient therapy in mental health.<br /><br /> In the last few years two doctors from UK have come to see me  for depression.<br /><br /> They told me that being a student with depression was very difficult  with little support  and the psychiatrists kept trying different meds to little effect.  Both got  psychotherpy and it helped .Both of them  had been in hospital at  some stage.<br /><br /> I did not change their medication. Biochemically one was severely undermethylated which is a marker for  severe depression and often OCD, which she actually has. She has since been reduced from paroxetine 60 mg to 20 mg and is functioning well. She  has got her membership and is now a consultant.<br /><br /> The other one was not as bad and after extensive testing I found that  she had a pyrrole disorder. That is a byproduct in making red blood cells and if it is high  and  does not pass out in the urine it causes severe psychiatic problems,including schizophrenia. The treatment is very easy with zinc, Vit B6 and some other individualised  nutrients and she got  well in a matter of weeks. She was already a consultant when she came here but had been out of work for months. Within weeks she was back at work and does not need any medication. She came to see me since and was quite joyful. She also referred a patient to me.<br /><br /> Female doctors have about 6 times the risk of suicide as other women. I am quite sure that if their biochemistry was normalised that many of them would be well.  The general public would also benefit  from this type of therapy. Courses are recently  available in USA - see details at  www.walshinstiture.org . I did the course in Sydney A good book is Nutrient Power by William Walsh PhD.

279	59	1	An article published in this months Student BMJ outlines how it has been raised by the future forum (a consultation group for the NHS) that finals should be standardised across all UK medical schools. This has been raised because there are concerns of the preparedness of graduates and an inconsistency in the competency in graduates entering foundation training. The article also outlines how apparently the National Training Survey published in 2011 by the GMC showed that 24% of foundation year doctors did not feel adequately prepared for their first job.I wonder why this issue has come about. It seems ludicrous to think that medical students are not being assessed to the same degree in their final exam as the whole point of the GMC guidelines is so that this type of concern does not raise its head. The whole point of Tomorrows Doctors is to make sure that all graduates are equipped with the same skills in the same way. How are the finals all of a sudden causing this?The point being raised about 24% of new F1s not feeling prepared I believe has nothing to do with how they are tested for their finals. Surely confidence is acquired not throught the sitting of exams but through the practice of clinical skills on willing patients?I do not think that by simply making the final paper the same for all medical schools is somehow going to make them feel either more confident or more like doctors. Creating an exam such as the one suggested by the Future Forum is allied to the idea of there only being one exam board that is allowed to set GCSEs or A levels instead of the current system of OCR and Edexcel etc. That idea I likewise believe to be foolish. What is everyones opinion on this matter?? Would a one exam system be better?Here is the link to the article: http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.e600	NCantley	2012-10-29 13:48:00	0	0
280	59	1	I agree that exams alone do not make someone feel qualified to be a doctor. But I have wondered why there isn't a standardised exam for becoming a doctor. I can see that medicine is a university degree and you don't have standard ones for law or classics but medicine you would assume is something all graduates should be measured on in a uniform way. Why couldn't the colleges come up with something? I don't know if there is a problem that needs solving eg is there much of a difference between Bristol and Southampton's finals papers. But there shouldn't be should there?	luisad	2012-10-29 13:48:00	0	0

282	59	1	"The problem would be, that not all courses are structured in the same way; many have modular courses, and asessments at the end of each course, rather than a ""big bang"" final exam. The content of each module is not necessarily standard across several schools, so a standard assessment would be quite difficult to achieve."	Ginny May	2012-10-29 13:48:00	0	0
283	59	1	i think sitting a commmon final exams will not all of a sudden boost confidence levels, but it will go to measure how close the graduate doctor is to standards set by the state. They could still sit their final exams in the university to get their degree but i think they should all sit a common licensing exams in order to gain permission to practice.	donkhermikal	2012-10-29 13:48:00	0	0

After graduateing we only have provisional registration from the GMC, we can't achieve full registration unless we achieve all our FY1 compentancies, which are set nationally.The trouble with a national exam is then medical schools start teaching to the exam, and start to loose their individuility.	ross71521	2012-10-29 13:48:00	0	0
285	59	1	Having the same exam would involve a degree of cooperation on scheduling which would be almost impossible. In essence, you're asking 32 institutions to provide a suitable room at the same time for each component of the assessment.

286	59	1	I agree with NCantley; it's difficult to see how any final exam could improve the preparedness of medical graduates.  That comes about through sustained training and education that better reflects what a new doctor needs to be able to do.  Simulation has been a valuable adjunct but competence, which is such a strangely popular concept, does not predict well how someone will perform in the real world. That requires more experience with real patients in real settings.<br /><br /> Some experience, that is too often optional, should be mandatory, in particular enough experience of dealing with acute problems at night.  It's also worrying how many students can come to graduation never having had direct experience of dealing with all the procedures surrounding a death. That also includes the need to declare to HMRC all income from cremation forms.  Every few years many doctors continue to have to learn this lesson the hard and expensive way!

287	59	1	I had always understood that the GMC used to set the MINIMUM standard of what should be taught, and let the Medical Schools get on with it as long as the standard was met.<br /><br /> There also used to be a parallel qualification (LRCP, MRCS) set by the Royal Colleges of Surgery and Medicine the 'Conjoint Board' the examiners for which were, in the main, the examiners of the various medical schools. The exam standard was therefore pretty comparable.<br /><br /> Many students did both the degree and Conjoint, but some who had dropped out from the degrees coulod still qualify via the Conjoint exams. The main differences were that Conjoint was more highly geared to practical medicine, and one could sit final examinations individually instead of all together - i.e. Medicine, Surgery, Ob/Gyn.<br /><br /> The Conjoint system ceased about 1985 (I think - open to correction there)  and eventuially the MRCS was hijacked into replacing the FRCS as the higher qualification in surgery, parallelling the MRCP.<br /><br /> -	Poltor	2015-05-29 13:54:00	0	0
288	60	1	I will be returning to fourth year of a UK medical school after having taken the year out to deal with some personal struggles with depression, in which I lived abroad and distanced myself from anything medically-related. Prior to that year, I did an intercalation in Medical Humanities (studying medicine in literature and philosophy), so basically have not been exposed to science-y, clinical medicine for two years!<br /><br /> I was just wondering if anyone had been in a similar position of dealing with a transition back into medical school after a significant break, and what advice people could give on re-familiarising oneself with the sheer enormity of the content we are expected to know? Is there a way to revise or prepare for going back into Hospitals without actually being allowed to go on a hospital placement until I am re-enrolled and term has already started?	Taliaeilon	2015-05-13 14:02:00	2	0
289	60	1	Firstly well done for recognising the need to occasionally take time off for personal issues and well done for returning!<br /><br /> I took a year out in the middle of year 4 to have my first child. I told myself all sorts of great things about how I was going to use maternity leave to get some extra reading done etc. Funnily enough I found I was otherwise occupied! I returned to a not too busy firm so I had an ease in period of about 4 weeks and it was necessary. <br /><br /> My advice, don't panic. You are still a student and you will be surprised how much you will remember and how much you can pick up with some proper application. If you can, go into any hospital and explain your situation- maybe they might let you follow a Dr around just to remember what a prescription chart looks like! If you aren't allowed into a hospital yet concentrate on the book side. Get some of online question banks: passmedicine, passtest etc and practice getting back into that medical reasoning mindset. <br /><br /> Once you get back don't beat yourself up if you aren't instantly as sharp as you used to be. Find a good, fair, friendly, knowledgeable mentor in your firm (student or Dr) to stick to like glue until you get your confidence back.<br /><br /> Good luck!	Drob	2015-05-18 15:36:00	0	0
290	61	1	"Q: How do most students hear about extra curricular events going on that they are interested? <br /><br />A: It would appear that most people hear about events via word of mouth, through social media or via mailing lists that they are signed up to. <br /><br />Q: How do most students find out about conferences that they can attend or present at? <br /><br />A: Mainly via their supervisors, word of mouth from like minded colleagues, mailing lists of certain organisations advertising their own conferences or via trawling Google. Two of the relatively major conference databases can be found below:<br /><br />http://www.medical.theconferencewebsite.com/medical-conferences-2015<br /><br />http://www.globaleventslist.elsevier.com/events/#/filterYears=2015&disciplineIds=&specialtyIds=&continentCodes=&countryCodes=<br /><br /> QuID is an organisation founded by students for students and we were wondering if there might be a better/ easier way for other students to find out about events - big and small. <br /><br /> The first step we have made to try and encourage more medical students to work togethe is to create a ""hub"" of contact details for medical school societies across the UK. Using this list you should be able to contact students at almost every single medical school relatively easily:<br /><br />http://www.quid.org.uk/resources/collaboration<br /><br /> So if you want to organise or advertise events then you can send an email via these contact details. We would also be really happy to add your society to this list. <br /><br /> Our next plan is to build a ""free, open access"" events calendar for academic medical events - workshops, lectures, conferences etc so that it is eaier to advertise your events to a wider cohort of students and doctors. The link to explaining how to access this calendar is below: <br /><br />http://www.quid.org.uk/all-ongoing-projects/on-going-projects/item/60-academic-medicine-events-hub-calendar-in-development<br /><br /> The link to the current calendar can be found here: <br /><br />http://www.quid.org.uk/resources/events/month.calendar/2015/05/17/-<br /><br /> We hope that you find these resources useful. We would really appreciate any feedback on what we have done so far via: <br /><br /> quid.editor@gmail.com<br /><br /> @QuID_UK #StudentLedChange<br /><br /> Also, please get in touch if you would be keen to get involved with QuID in anyway.

298	63	1	I’m afraid that what the “blog idea” suits best is literature, art, or other relevant issues which are of a general nature and (by nature) subjective. Art or general views can be expressed orally or on paper by almost anyone with honourable intentions.   But in the case of science one must speak lying on evidence or some kind of logic or at least following a logical algorithm. This is very dubious as to who can do it.  Yet, not every scientific discovery in history is the result of evidence. Brilliant, innovative and radical minds appear from time to time, though scarcely one must admit, and they subvert the norms and the “scientific canonical dogmatism” of their time. Such minds could post their ideas in blogs and something could then come out of this.  But the vast majority of scientists aren’t this kind of minds. Moreover there is a high possibility all these blog posts became a sort of Babel Tower and collapse instantly into sheer “nothingness”. Scientists and investigators must have a lodestar to commence or sustain their “journey” and this lodestar, or compass, or whatever… has to hold principles and rules and this can be done only by journals and societies… at least for now.	panossim	2012-10-29 14:02:00	0	0

Though some of them provide free-access to research articles. accessing information from the big ones is difficult. This is only possible if we can find common ground beyond our personal gains and achievement. There is a tendency to submit articles to the big ones first and then to turn to the 'lesser' ones only if rejected.

305	65	1	One person was sexually harassed in his child hood, and as he remembers he was having some symptoms of STD (Syphilis) at that time. After some time, these symptoms disappeared and then he used to suffer from stomach disorder, unusual skin spots, pain in body, joints, headache, sleeplessness, too much sweating, hair loss in patches, vision problem, hearing problem and other problems. But at that time nobody could understand this disease. Now he is 50 years old and now these problems are increasing day by day. He has children and they are also showing the different symptoms. The person contacted Skin department of different hospitals including AIIMS, New Delhi and other private doctors, but could not get satisfied. He says that he is suffering from the latent stage of STD and children are showing teeth disorder, skin spots which very much resemble with the syphilis symptoms. But nobody is ready to treat this family.  I want to ask the doctors that whether syphilis at the late stage is treatable or not. If it can be treated, please save the life of six seven persons. I request to Sri Amir Khan, as he is taking the social problems. I hope at least he may come ahead.

But we keep on losing those redundant overlappings as we age. Hence, we will have to work hard to keep the remaining systems healthy and intact. With the drugs and intervention, if we perturb these remaining systems; we tend to show the pathophysiological effects ..?

315	67	1	Obviously, atheletes and anyone involved in endurance sports are highly prone to injuries, inflammation and pain. The pain killers are common in use. To go further, there are many pain killers available over-the-counter.The physiology of pain killing in sports especially effects of Cyclooxygenase inhibition goes on (inhibit or not to inhibit).Here BMJ_Open (congratulations opening this Open item) has published one such study. The focus has been : Cardiovascular, Renal and Gastrointestinal effects!=================AbstractObjectives To prevent pain inhibiting their performance, many athletes ingest over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics before competing. We aimed at defining the use of analgesics and the relation between OTC analgesic use/dose and adverse events (AEs) during and after the race, a relation that has not been investigated to date.Design Prospective (non-interventional) cohort study, using an online questionnaire.Setting The Bonn marathon 2010.Participants 3913 of 7048 participants in the Bonn marathon 2010 returned their questionnaires.Primary and secondary outcomes Intensity of analgesic consumption before sports; incidence of AEs in the cohort of analgesic users as compared to non-users.Results There was no significant difference between the premature race withdrawal rate in the analgesics cohort and the cohort who did not take analgesics (‘controls’). However, race withdrawal because of gastrointestinal AEs was significantly more frequent in the analgesics cohort than in the control. Conversely, withdrawal because of muscle cramps was rare, but it was significantly more frequent in controls. The analgesics cohort had an almost 5 times higher incidence of AEs (overall risk difference of 13%). This incidence increased significantly with increasing analgesic dose. Nine respondents reported temporary hospital admittance: three for temporary kidney failure (post-ibuprofen ingestion), four with bleeds (post-aspirin ingestion) and two cardiac infarctions (post-aspirin ingestion). None of the control reported hospital admittance.Conclusions The use of analgesics before participating in endurance sports may cause many potentially serious, unwanted AEs that increase with increasing analgesic dose. Analgesic use before endurance sports appears to pose an unrecognised medical problem as yet. If verifiable in other endurance sports, it requires the attention of physicians and regulatory authorities.================= http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/4/e002090.fullWhen I discussed with one of the researcher long ago, he mentioned pain killers are used like popcorns!There is cautionary tail.....it is important that we look all aspects in their uses for different age groups and purposes.

OA Medical Hypothesis 2013 May 01;1(1):7.Houck PD. Alternative view of congestive heart failure exacerbations: Role of lymphatic function and inflammation. OA Medical Hypothesis 2013 May 01;1(1):6These two articles are available as a provisional PDF file at the following open access website.http://www.oapublishinglondon.com/oa-medical-hypothesisIntroduction: Lymphatic function and inflammation are two related concepts that have been neglected in heart failure. All of the symptoms of heart failure, hence, compensatory mechanisms can be related to overwhelmed or dysfunctional lymphatic function. Lymphatics are responsible for tissue homeostasis controlling approximately 12 liters of fluid. These thin walled valved pumping systems are also intimately involved in immunity and control of inflammation. Lipid and nutritional transport; and repair of damaged tissues by cellular transport round out its many function. The Hypothesis: Inflammation is the cause of decompensated heart failure and lymphatics and their reaction to environment are the primary mediators. This concept is consistent with a new model of disease - regeneration balanced by degeneration with inflammation (lymphatic function) serving as the fulcrum.Adapted from with permission Houck PD, de Oliveira JMF. Applying laws of biology to diabetes with emphasis on metabolic syndrome. Med Hypotheses (2013) Http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2012.11.019 CONCLUSION The Lymphatic system is an unexplored fine vascular network involved in interstitial homeostasis and inflammation. This network helps to relieve symptoms of heart failure mainly edema and dyspnea. The system is directly linked to inflammation which is responsible for protection from the environment and for repair. “Lymphangiontrope” is a new term that characterizes lymphatic pumping function. Medication that improves lymphangiontrope will help relieve symptoms of heart failure. Current therapies should be re-evaluated to understand the influence of interventions on lymphangiontrope. This concept is especially important considering that current therapy of preload reduction is associated with increased mortality. New therapies that influence lymphatics will likely be chemical drugs, mechanical stimulants, electrical stimulants, biologicals, and cellular treatments. These therapies will also influence inflammation and regeneration and remodeling of the heart. Introduction: Diseases are in constant evolution and new diseases spring into our world. The changes can be subtle and often overlooked. The article Alternative View of Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbations Role of Lymphatic Function and Inflammation examines the lymphatic system. This article implies that heart failure exacerbations frequently occur due to an adverse perturbation of the periphery as opposed to the decline of central cardiac function. Hypothesis: Heart failure is evolving due to environmental factors that affect the periphery. Our patients have evolved into a larger species suffering from obstructed sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, recalcitrant hypertension, and inflammation. Right heart failure has become a more common presentation of heart failure.

The approach has to be molded to the individual and as the individual changes; the approach has to be adjusted. I am crotchety because it will be 15 to 20 years before they become guidelines; and by that time, heart failure will have evolved into something else. I am crotchety because I want to know the effect of heart failure medication on circulating stem cells, inflammation, and lymphatic function a powerful mediator of peripheral compensation. Read the articles and see if your perspective on heart failure changes.  Crotchety Houckster	Houckster	2013-05-14 18:45:00	0	0

Teddy bears and bubbles are permanent favourites, but toys such as TellyTubbies have fallen in & then out of favour with children. <br /><br />This Irish study uses the well established tool of a hospital examination glove, inflated & tied as an improved balloon. In their prospective trial they offered children the gloves in the form of Jedward (using all 5 fingers as the distinctive Jedward hair style) or the Mohawk (where the thumb represents the nose & fingers the hair). Their observation was that only 13 of the 149 children were no interested in playing with either glove style, but that 55% preferred the ""Jedward"" and 45% the ""Mohawk"".<br /><br />I do wonder if the results would be the same in the UK or USA, or if the Mohawk would have been more popular in the era of Mr.T and the A-Team?

There are already many healthcare Twitter journal clubs about (http://www.symplur.com/healthcare-hashtags/tweet-chats/) so we would need to be distinct in what we were offering our followers. DrS has written about Guerilla medical education and the role of Twitter - which showed the value of impromptu clinical Twitter discussions. We think this is a great way to initiate discussion and engage the wider medical community.We would like to take this idea forward and would welcome your thoughts on which papers we should cover and how we could distinguish ourselves from other chats.	mbillingsley	2013-01-15 14:15:00	0	0

There is irrefutable evidence that high salt diet (sodium/sodium chloride) increases blood pressure.This week BMJ has published a meta-analysis on longer term modest reduction on salt intake and its effect on blood pressure....entitled ""Effect of longer term modest salt reduction on blood pressure: Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials""The gist of the study:=============================What is already known on this topicA modest reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure and thereby reduces cardiovascular riskA recent meta-analysis of salt reduction trials implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids, which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with the reduction in blood pressure. This meta-analysis, however, included a large number of trials with a large change in salt intake for only a few days, which are irrelevant to the current public health recommendations for a modest reduction in salt intake for a long period of timeWhat this study addsA longer term modest reduction in salt intake leads to significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic groupWith salt reduction, there is a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and noradrenaline and no significant change in lipid concentrationsThere is a dose-response relation between the reduction in salt intake and the fall in systolic blood pressure. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9-12 to 5-6 g/day will have a major effect but a further reduction to 3 g/day will have a greater effect=============================It is noted that Salt intake in fact is in increasing trend....for sure it is not decreasing especially when it is added in many food items. Hence, we are taking without noticing actually in many instances."	Matiram Pun	2013-04-07 07:53:00	0	0

327	76	1	I came from an era where in my pre-clinical years tere was no internet available, and in my final clinical years internet was still in its infancy with regards to medical education. Knowledge meant books, and the lucky ones would find a nice medical an audio or video-cassette tape or a CD (later). This may have resulted in an urge to teach medical residents nad tell them what I suffered to learn.<br /><br /> Time gap made education different, where medical residents are suffering the opposite (information over-load), sometimes, unable, unwilling to hear/learn, most if not all smart phones, tablets, iPads, and computers at hand. They study at their own pace, do not find medical pearls or clinical experience as valuable as a website.<br /><br /> I am not sure what would be a different way to help them without spoon-feeding the, I also wonder whether with this technological era, the image of a doctor changed from the person with a huge info on his/her mind, to a person who is versatile at searching.<br /><br /> Luckily I found a blog that discusses a close topic	Sidhom	2014-09-04 20:51:00	0	0

329	76	1	If I may say something about Law students. When I get a new student to supervise inevitably they will have a laptop and/or a tablet and always a smart phone. I make no comment initially to the student about their use and observe them during client interviews. What usually happens is that during such a client interview they furiously tap the keyboard trying to getting an almost verbatim record of what is said lest they forget a single point.<br /><br /> Afterwards when the student and I are alone in my office I ask the student what he/she thought of the meeting? What were the key matters that were identified? What should be our plan of action now we have gleaned direct evidence from the horses mouth? Usually the student will then turn to their lap top and scroll down to locate the information required to answer the questions. I let them take whatever time they need and ultimately they come up with some sort of answers that they think will be correct. Finally I ask them what was their impression of the client? (I am hoping they will answer with such observations about whether the client appeared to be truthful, are they likely to make a good impression as a witness if the case came to court?).<br /><br /> They are usually not very successful exercises initially. I explain to them that it is my view (so therefore other people have different views and ultimately everyone must decide what technique is best for them) that it is better to just keep a pen and paper to hand and just jot down key points as the interview flows. The client needs to know that they have the full attention of the lawyer (because the lawyer will be making a big difference in their life in the future) and eye contact helps to assess the clients reliability. If you desperately keep writing or typing down everything you are missing probably 90% of relevant information you need. <br /><br /> Next time I ask them to try the system I suggest and compare them. Invariably second time round they do so much better and seem to realise that although technology can be utilised invaluably in the practice of law it does not mean you have to use it for everything. For example I used to love spending hours in the law library reading through weighty tombs and my table would be covered with large texts, periodicals and Law reports. I still do some of my work in the old fashioned way because it also allows me peace from telephones etc etc.<br /><br /> Computers and the internet have been invaluable for legal research by making the search for relevant information very quick and comprehensive. Law students also are very lucky because there is so much access via the internet at their fingertips - it would be wrong of me to tell students to do it the old fashioned way.<br /><br /> A general comment about Law students which I expect will be true of medical students is that (as one would expect) some are keen, very active and try to get as much as they can from their attachment. Others are clearly less motivated and don't seem to have an awful lot of interest in what they are doing. After a few days if I have a student of the latter type I will have a strong discussion with the student. If they are not very interested in the attachment I suggest to them that they withdraw and I will arrange for another student to come - we have a very long waiting list for students and those with law degrees waiting to spend learning time with us because we are one organisation of only three in the UK that deals with defending medical professionals - in light of that I want students who appreciate the value of the experience they will gain.<br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2014-09-05 08:46:00	1	0
330	76	1	Sometimes finding the reference text to study is little challenging but now a days internet is quite helpful in sourcing the recommended text. The success of technology and internet study has very positive attitudes among students.	Joseph Diaz	2016-04-14 05:01:00	0	0
331	76	1	Kirked<br /><br /> Aspects of what you describe are certainly also problems with medical students.  If there is genuinely a need to record a full transcript of a conversation with either a patient or client then, with the patient/client's permission, it is surely better to record the conversation digitally and either review this for learning purposes or for the patient/client's benefit, using contemporaneous brief key points noted.  We don't need to revisit all the concerns on an old thread about this but presumably a 'typed' transcript is not really any different, legally, to a voice recording so the latter needn't present serious problems given proper consent and confidentiality.<br /><br /> In addition to missing a considerable proportion of what they are supposed to be picking up, these students might need to be reminded that it's also just rude not to give your full attention to whoever is trying to tell you something or have a conversation.  I  heard countless patients complaining about clinicians who spent most of the consultation looking at a screen.  Occasionally, of course it's extremely useful to share screen information or images with the patient at the time.<br /><br /> As Joseph Diaz says, the internet has been invaluable in gaining quick access to information; it's simply that it's a step that should usually wait until the human interaction has finished.  Despite all the lip service given to so-called 'communication skills' there are too many who simply don't appreciate the vital importance of mindful attention.  Going back to Sidhom's original concern about 'spoon-feeding', it is certainly the case that many students and trainees complain that they receive no teaching even when offered excellent opportunities to learn from a Socratic type of tutorial.  The irony is that they probably learned no more even when spoon-fed.

338	83	1	This is a good question and the simple answer would be that there is no single or simple answer.  I facilitated PBL groups for a couple of years fairly recently and it became clear that there can be quite a gap between the theory and practice of PBL, the structure of which probably varies somewhat between Medical Schools.<br /><br /> The first requirement is to be clear about what needs to be learned.  This varies from some fairly clearcut clinical science, that can be assessed in conventional ways, through to the ability to work in a team, leadership, feedback, analysis and explanatory skills.  I am not sure anyone knows the best way to assess these latter capabilities but using the group itself will certainly play a major role and this itself forms a good test of the ability to feedback constructively.<br /><br /> The difficulty with PBL, from my own experience, is mainly around the concept of self-directed learning.  This can too easily become a sort of 'teach-yourself' clinical science and medicine which is not acceptable when it is merely a substitute for some good basic teaching from experts.  When complex clinical scenarios are presented to years 1 and 2 students before such good teaching it can have little meaning and this causes frustration.<br /><br /> I hope this is of some value.  And I didn't once use those irritating words 'issue' or 'competence'!

I know I have quite a bit of time before I have to start worrying about if I am going to get accepted or not, but from what I've learned-only rich, super intelligent people attend medical school.<br /><br /> Now, I know that might sound like a stereotype, but I just don't think I'm the kind of person who would get accepted... My GPA for last year was 3.8, and I plan on getting a 4.0 for the rest of highschool. I am an advanced pianist, intermediate/advanced horseback rider, and plan on doing several 4h projects next year (possibly involving medicine). I am also signing up for math, science, history, and english academic teams. I also run several semi-successful blogs, write a lot, and study anatomy/health, history, math, etc. Every day for at least an hour over the summer. In the spring I run track.<br /><br /> I guess my question is-am I doing the right things? Will these things matter more when I am in college, or do my highschool years count as well? I know a 4.0 in highschool is important to get accepted into the University I want to attend for an undergraduate degree, but are good SAT scores and good grades in college more important? Also, do sports count? I plan on playing tennis next year.<br /><br /> On top of all this, I am going to do volunteer work at nursing homes. But that would just be playing piano, so I could get some hours of volunteer work. Does volunteer work look good?<br /><br /> I'm just worried that I am not on the right track. Any advice is appreciated!

354	88	1	Meghan - Welcome and I wish you well but worry about your questions. Pay may be relevant but really is not the main thing which determined whether many of us have regrets about going into medicine or not. Just giving doctors more money does not seem to produce satisfaction anyway. The subject has also changed a lot - disillusionment in the UK often seems centred around new issues (work patterns , so many of the disorders now are self-induced , patient expectations etc...). You sound the sort of person we need - a bit of brightness helps but it is not the be-all and end-all. In Europe there are other ways of qualifying - in particular by training in another European country - and once qualified one can then prove (or of course disprove) one's competence as a doctor in a practical way. <br /><br /> PS I have known a number of doctors who have opted out of medicine after qualifying and perhaps any questions about regrets should address them . I do not know how you would contact them , but perhaps someone should do this as a project if it has not been done. One of my own family went to a prestigious medical school - for one term. Medicine is just not right for some folk and he had the good sense to realise that early on. Perhaps career advice is better now , but sometimes one just goes where the competition is without thinking about it seriously enough. Times change - when I left school I never really thought about earning a living although I realised that I would have to do it some day.  Much the same way that most folk never think about their death - but recognise it may come one day.......	sken	2014-06-03 22:07:00	0	0

Is there any correlation between grades and performance?<br /><br /> Does anybody still believe a string of numbers or letters awarded - with doubtful equipoise and justice - in her or his youth can faithfully summarize that person's ability and predict (sic!) later performance in professional life? Get rid of grades, teach better, teach Medicine and you'll, perhaps, get good doctors. Forecasts are difficult to make, especially about the future.<br /><br />  <br /><br /><br /> Posted by Sidhom	lfc	2014-05-07 16:13:00	1	0
362	89	1	"I guess you'd need to specify what sort of performance.  I've yet to see any good longitudinal studies (let alone evidence) that relate a range of subsequent real clinical abilities to performance at Medical School.  If someone is good at multple choice exams in medical school they might retain that ability but that has a tenuous relationship to other characteristics of a good doctor.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> I agree with Dundee Chest that later experiences and interests can transform people.  Perhaps JK Galbraith's economics dictum applies equally to Medicine:  ""There are two sorts of people who predict the future, those who don't know and those who don't know they don't know."""

364	89	1	There is data in the UK on which medical school produce doctors who will do well in professional exams.  Of course there's an 8 year lag betwen changing a medical degree and seeing the results.<br /><br /> University of Dundee did very badly in this analysis 4 years ago (I'll try to find the reference) being in teh bottom 3 schools wrt MRCP.  However, it does will wrt MRCGP.  So, do we train students to be good GPs?  Perhaps, but I suspect there's more to it.  Particularly as our ST trainees, regardless of their graduatiing school, do very well at MRCP.  So the place you're working when you sit PACES seems to have an influence too.

365	89	1	academics wise, yes. but iof u see a larger picture comprising enterprenuership, money minting, risk taking behaviours & so called extremely successful practices - they are indeed the domain of those with poor medical grades. <br /><br /> the reason behind is that those with good grades often stick to ETHICS, and at the end, work for the better ones as chief consultant. Over a long period of time, this makes things difficult for the recent graduates who wish to work ethically.	Sachin India	2014-05-08 14:29:00	0	0
366	89	1	It is not a yes or no question.<br /><br /> I've seen colleagues and students who did remarkably well with exams, yet their clinical years were much less glamorous.<br /><br /> And I've seen people struggling with exams and later doing great in clinical setup.<br /><br /> If someone is great with exams that doesn't say he /she has great hands for surgery.<br /><br /> We must also understand that people grow and change in the course of time. Some are good from beginning, some are late bloomers. Some are very good at the beginning and then are less impressive.<br /><br /> It comes down to the individual at the end. Yes, there is something that holds promise in good students with good grades, but there are also those who start less impressively and grow during the years.<br /><br /> Making a doctor and being a doctor is a constantly developing process, and should be viewed as such.<br /><br /> Still, there are those with less hope and the hopeless that won't be good whatever you do..<br /><br /> It is also important to remember that grades and exams measure only what we make them to measure. <br /><br /> So it is very much up to the people who write the exam to incorporate the right questions that are intended to measure what one believes is the essene of the course. <br /><br /> I can say that there are also misses in that respect.	yoram chaiter	2014-05-08 21:42:00	1	0
367	89	1	Yoram is right. The whole thing is complicated. A test might predict your outcome later in life, but also it might not.<br /><br /> Some people who do well at tests have just a special gifts for them, but won´t do well in daily routine.In Germany, surgeons´ associations have recently called for not over-estimating tests or exams ( mostly because girls tend to excel at them here - many boys don´t get into med school nowadays because girls have better marks, and so on. Most newly employed judges are women, too, for the same reasons).	Carolin	2014-05-09 14:56:00	1	0
368	90	1	International Journal of Infectious Diseases: Unexpected and Rapid Spread of Zika Virus in The Americas - Implications for Public Health Preparedness for Mass Gatherings at the 2016 Brazil Olympic Games<br /><br />  “Mass gatherings at major international sporting events put millions of international travelers and local host-country residents at risk of acquiring infectious diseases, including locally endemic infectious diseases. The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently aroused global attention due to its rapid spread since its first detection in May 2015 in Brazil to 22 other countries and other territories in the Americas. The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, has also been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly and neurological disorders, and has been declared a ‘Global Emergency by the World Health Organization. This explosive spread of ZIKV in Brazil poses challenges for public health preparedness and surveillance for the Olympics and Paralympics which are due to be held in Rio De Janeiro in August, 2016. We review the epidemiology and clinical features of the current ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, highlight knowledge gaps, and review the public health implications of the current ZIKV outbreak in the Americas. We highlight the urgent need for a coordinated collaborative response for prevention and spread of infectious diseases with epidemic potential at mass gatherings events.”<br /><br />  <br /><br /> What will Zika mean for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games?

369	90	1	A very difficult point, Sabreena, and one on which I'm torn.<br /><br /> I have my place at the Games so I really, really want them to continue.    Despite the inoculations I must have to go to Brazil, from Hep A to rabies, there isn't one for Zika, or Dengue, so I intend to use the strongest solution of DEET I can find and apply it diligently, sleep under a DDT impregnated net and avoid evenings in the open.  And anyway, for an elderly male, Zika is almost not an issue.<br /><br /> But I have children who are presently forming families.     I do NOT want to think I could come back and carry Zika near them so I will have to avoid them for at least two weeks (advice from tropical diseases guru - personal communication, as he said he could not possibly publish that as official!).      And mosquitos of the Aedes species just don't live in the UK, at present anyway - malaria existed in the Thames marshes and Norfolk in the past, and will in the future, as climate change takes place, but not now. http://pmj.bmj.com/content/80/949/663.full So the UK is relatively safe at present, and returning Gamesmakers won't be a problem, here.<br /><br /> But there will be visitors to the Games from throughout that part of the world where Aedes exists.   That's between the isotherms for 10C in winter, and includes almost all of South America, which is already infected, Middle and North America up to California to North Carolina, the whole of Africa, Europe from Southern France to Greece, the Middle East, India, the Far East. most of Australia and the Pacific Islands.   Phew!  They ARE going to get Zika!<br /><br /> I really don't know, and I fear that no one knows.    We don't even know if there really is an epidemic of microcephaly in South America, but the human consequences of that if real are horrible.   And we have only six months to find out.<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-02-10 14:08:00	3	0
370	90	1	Cancelling the Olympic Games is not a solution of ZIka, we should find out its proper vaccine or antibiotics. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. If you have any one of these, you need to go to the urgent care clinic.	CAUrgentCare	2016-02-12 10:56:00	3	0
371	90	1	"Thank you, CAUrgentCare! <br /><br />    For anyone not a foetus, Zika seems to be a flu-like illness, with no (?) common complications.   So the concern is only for the foetus,  What do we know about the association?   This report from CDC http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6503e2.htm finds that in the past Brazil had ""approximately 0.5 cases per 10,000 live births"" whihc was thought to be an under-report, with a true rate of 1-2/10K.    In only the second half of 2015, 20/10K have been reported, but that no previous head circumference records were made and there had been no laboratory confirmation of Zika infection in the mothers or infants, so that bias is inevitable.   As usual, and as the BMJ bans, more data is needed.<br /><br />But that didn't help me make up my mind - the Games should continue.    Zika WILL spread to the other parts of the world where transmitting mosguitoes live, the Games might let it do so a bit quicker, that's all.<br /><br />John"	John D	2016-02-12 12:15:00	3	0
372	90	1	Many thanks to Sabreena for this excellent post. Apart from John D many of us have been wondering about this. It is yet another nail in the potential coffin of the Brazil Olympics. There seems increasingly little hope that the infra structure will be in place , some of the watersport areas are likely to be unhealthy , ticket sales I believe are not going well and now Zika. Many of the sports now have other world class competitions and athletes from these may prefer not to compete - particularly if some of the top contenders +/- their countries are absent following drug scandals.<br /><br /> There is also the problem that Brazil is running into problems in its anti-mosquito campaign.<br /><br /> It could be that events will snowball and cancellation become inevitable but that might be pretty disastrous for Brazil and it would require a kirked to decide how far compensation would be payable.<br /><br /> Any advice on returning travellers might tend to be overcautious. The idea of John D in quarantine for 2 weeks with just a computer for company could be interesting for doc2doc...<br /><br /> Apart from the foetal risks a bit more is emerging to suggeat that G-B may be a rare complication - but that can be pretty major. It might have a low mortality in its own right but some of us might well prefer demise to really severe disease and decline ventilation. <br /><br /> The one bit of good that might emerge is that the UK needs to look at its mozzie breeding grounds. They exist in most gardens etc... and it is only a matter of time before we have some of these mosquitos breeding in the UK .	sken	2016-02-15 15:15:00	3	0

403	99	1	Medication-use problems are an issue that policymakers are trying to find more effective solutions for, seeking ways to optimise the role of healthcare professionals in managing these patients. Community pharmacists are now being recognised as a lesser used resource for improving patients' use and understanding of their medications - meaning that revisions are being made to healthcare policies to expand the authority of pharmacists in this way.<br /><br />Clinical performance of healthcare professionals has been shown to display small improvements when being presented with audit data and feedback of their care. However, there have not been studies done for pharmacists, to evaluate whether the use of audit and feedback could increase pharmacists' provision of services or improve performance on standardised medication-use measures.<br /><br />This study, by Winslade et al, seeks to evaluate the impact of such performance feedback to community pharmacists on the provision of services and quality of hypertensive and asthmatic patients' medication use. In a randomised, controlled, single-blind trial in 1,833 community pharmacies in Canada, this study used provincial billing data to measure performance, and mailed comparative feedback reported the pharmacy-level percentage of dispensings to patients either non-adherent to antihypertensive medications or those overusing asthma drugs.<br /><br />The authors found that this comparative pharmacy performace feedback did increase the provision of asthma pharmacy services. However, they did not find that audit and feedback was effective in providing an improvement in managing non-compliance of antihypertensive medication, or in the performance of medication-use measures.<br /><br />What are your views on audit and feedback? What do you think could improve the management of non-compliance of antihypertensive medication in this setting?<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /> More information about this article:<br /><br />Abstract<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Objective To evaluate the impact of comparative performance feedback to community pharmacists on provision of professional services and the quality of patients’ medication use.<br /><br /><br /><br />Design Randomised, controlled, single-blind trial.<br /><br /><br /><br />Setting All 1833 community pharmacies in the Quebec province, Canada.<br /><br /><br /><br />Participants 1814 pharmacies not opting out and with more than 5 dispensings of the target medications during the 6-month baseline were randomised by a 2×2 factorial design to feedback first for hypertension adherence (907 control, 907 intervention) followed by randomisation for asthma adherence (791 control, 807 intervention). 1422 of 1814 pharmacies had complete information available during the follow-up for hypertension intervention (706 intervention, 716 control), and 1301 of 1598 had the follow-up information for asthma (657 intervention, 644 control).<br /><br /><br /><br />Intervention Using provincial billing data to measure performance, mailed comparative feedback reported the pharmacy-level percentage of dispensings to patients non-adherent to antihypertensive medications or overusing asthma rescue inhalers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Primary and secondary outcome measures The number of hypertension/asthma services billed per pharmacy and percentage of dispensings to non-adherent patients over the 12 months post intervention.<br /><br /><br /><br />Results Feedback on the asthma measure led to increased provision of asthma services (control 0.2, intervention 0.4, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.46). However, this did not translate into reductions in patients’ overuse of rescue inhalers (control 45.5%, intervention 44.6%, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01). For non-adherence to antihypertensive medications, feedback resulted in no difference in either provision of hypertension services (control 0.7, intervention 0.8, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.82) or antihypertensive treatment adherence (control 27.9%, intervention 28.0%, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00). Baseline performance did not influence results, and there was no evidence of a cumulative effect with repeated feedback.<br /><br /><br /><br />Conclusions Comparative pharmacy performance feedback increased the provision of asthma pharmacists’ services but did not improve the performance on medication-use measures. Billing data can be used to evaluate the impact of billable services rendered by pharmacists on the quality of patients’ medication use.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> Link to the full text version of the paper: http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/5/e010865.full	Emma Gray	2016-05-23 15:29:00	0	0

406	101	1	About 2 weeks ago I was listening to a chap who suffered from severe cluster headaches and who found his reserve treatment was a concoction of magic mushrooms when other treatments failed. To-day the news is that they are (or at least the active ingredient psilocybin) seems to be rescue treatment for severe depression when other treatments are failing.<br /><br /> This is just where we need someone like Edzard Ernst to advise and explore. What a pity that the pro-alternative medicine crowd had him sidelined. He really should have known that a post designed to look at the subject was a post to promote it not to explore its basis and viability. Particularly when going totally against the belifs of the heir to the throne.<br /><br /> Of course there may be something in these magic mushroom stories. I still remember some patients taking Digitalis Folia before purer forms of digoxin became the rule.	sken	2016-05-17 12:30:00	0	0

408	101	1	Gosh, sken!   You or your patient is either prescient or very well informed!<br /><br /> The Lancet Psychiatry published yesterday a paper on the use of psilocybin in severe, intractable depression.   The paper does not mention, but news reports do because the senior author, Prof. David Nutt has said, that this study on a Class A drug (in the group with heroin and cocaine) took years to set up, and cost seventy times more per dose, because of that.<br /><br /> The paper is at http://www.thelancet.com/pb/assets/raw/Lancet/pdfs/S2215036616300657.pdf<br /><br /> I note that in this small study, that carefully selected its patients, the results were all positive and long lasting, and that psilocybin has a different mode of action (5-HT2A receptor agonism) to other antidepressants, so that Prof.Nutt's plan to progress to a much larger DBRC trial should be supported.<br /><br /> Apart from anything else, the Prof. clearly has a reliable source for his favourite medication!<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-05-18 07:52:00	0	0

412	101	1	Entheogens (LSD, magic mushrooms, etc.) in psychiatry have an intriguing history, they started in early 1960s, became popular in treatment of depression, alcoholism, and in psychotherapy as well. They were stopped due to emerging psychosis as a side effect. Some argue that it was more of a political decision rather than a medical one.<br /><br /> Recently, interested returned in their mechansim of action, and it became restudied for these purposes, the preliminary results seem promising. <br /><br /> I am not particularly interested in the origin of a substance, but rather in the rigorousness of methodology to study the way it works. I guess it is worth more studying.<br /><br /> I know it's been portrayed as virtue to criticise big pharma, but in a capitalist society; I wonder what would be the alternative to big pharma when it comes to drug development.

424	103	1	I am a producer at Outline Productions, an independent television production company. We are currently making a one-off feature length documentary for Channel 4 exploring offence with Trevor Phillips OBE, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The programme will be an intelligent and thought provoking examination of the issues and debates surrounding freedom of speech and the right to offend.<br /><br /> We are keen to explore how offence can influence healthcare. We have spoken to some medical professions that have told us doctors are increasingly concerned about their patients taking offence to things they say. We would very much like to hear some real world examples of this. We have heard that the following situations are not uncommon:<br /><br /><br />GPs feeling unable to tell parents their children are overweight.<br /><br />Patients accusing doctors of racism when ethnicity has been raised during diagnosis discussions.<br /><br />Doctors feeling unable to contradict a patient's self-diagnosis or belief in alternative therapies such as healing crystals or homeopathy. <br /><br /><br /> Have you experienced any situations like this at work? Do you feel that patients’ wellbeing may be at risk because medical professionals are not free to speak openly and honestly? If so, we would be very grateful if you got in touch. Initially all communication would be off-the-record and confidential.

426	103	1	"Jamie G - Good luck with this study. The biggest problem in this context is over obesity and the failure of this to be seen as a problem. Just read some of our ""upmarket"" papers where the problem is not only poorly recognised but also comment that an individual or offspring as having a problem is seen as offensive and judgemental. Yet evidence suggests that so many of those where overweight is a potential threat to health do not recognise that ""obesity"" applies to them. The net result is that medical opinion seems divided on whether this aspect of care should be raised with the person concerned. It is better to accept the status quo than to challenge it. Perhaps this is one reason why it was the leading reason for the recent perceived failure in giving the advice recommended for those who have had non STEMI heart attacks.  <br /><br />  I am not sure what you have in mind as regards ""contradicting"" patients' views on diagnosis or alternative therapies. One works with patients and their beliefs - refuting or contradicting beliefs in something else and going beyond the medical remit. I would not refer for these other treatments , but if the patient chose to go ahead , then that was up to them. As regards self-diagnosis . the patient is often correct . As a patient , I have recently had 2-3  major diagnoses which I made on myself but were not recognised by the doctors concerned  contributing to delays in referral for surgery on 2 counts. <br /><br />  I have now retired but recall very few examples where race or religion or even discussion about alcohol provided much friction where patients were concerned.

440	106	1	Hello all,<br /><br />Cardiology is an area of medicine that fascinates me, and hopefully after the long slog of medical school (provided I get in) it is something I would consider specialising in. Over the past few days I've been interested in how hot baths affect blood pressure. I have been taking my blood pressure using a portable BP device before and after a bath and, while admittedly the evidence isn't very scientific as the conditions are far from controlled, there seems to be a correlation. On all of the readings taken after a bath my systolic pressure seems to increase and my diastolic pressure seems to decrease. It lead me to wonder if there was any explanation to this, or whether it is just purely coincidental?<br /><br />It would be interesting to hear your thoughts,<br />Sam	samrneal	2013-05-16 11:59:00	0	0
441	106	1	"You might be inetrested in this wee study Sam:Effects of Temperature on Blood Pressure Sarah Gardner, David Hoch, Bryan LaFonteCU Boulder, Fall 2007            We tested the effects of temperature changes on human blood pressure. As one of the vital signs, blood pressure is a helpful indicator of the body’s internal conditions. It is the measure of force against the arteries as blood is pumped throughout the body (Van Voorhees 2006). Blood pressure is constantly changing to maintain homeostasis within the body. Since temperature change can disrupt homeostasis, we predicted that blood pressure will adjust to maintain body heat. This will lead to a rise in blood pressure when temperatures drop and a drop in blood pressure when temperatures rise. We also predicted that heart rate will remain constant to avoid another deviation in homeostasis. Our hypothesis is that blood pressure will rise in cold temperatures, and lower in hot temperatures.             To test this hypothesis, we measured the subject’s blood pressure while they were seated with their right hand in a beaker of cold water (5°C), hot water (42°C), and room temperature water (23°C). Heart rate was measured to have a comparison against changes in blood pressure. This was done by taking the radial pulse of the left hand. We took three measurements of blood pressure and heart rate for each of the three beakers of water; the first after initial exposure, the next after 1 ½ minutes, and the final after 3 minutes of exposure. We predicted that the average blood pressure in the cold water would be higher than the average blood pressure in the hot water.Our T-Test for means indicated that the blood pressure after exposure to cold temperatures was significantly greater (p=3.6 E -4) than the blood pressure after exposure to hot temperatures; with the average for the cold water being 133/90 mmHg and the average for the hot water being 121/78 mmHg. The average blood pressure for the room temperature water was 113/68 mmHg. There was no significant difference (p=0.29) between heart rates for the hot, cold, or room temperature water trials, for which the averages were 74, 76, and 76 bpm, respectively. Our regression tests showed that blood pressures for the cold water had a tendency to rise over time (R2=0.71), while the tendency of blood pressures in the hot water was to lower (R2=0.99). The results were consistent with our predictions; blood pressures were higher after exposure to cold water than exposure to hot water, while maintaining heart rate. This mechanism, increasing blood pressure without having to increase heart rate, prevents loss of body heat and helps sustain homeostasis. The major problem we encountered was the significant amount of time needed for each trial, preventing us from acquiring a large sample population and reducing the validity of our experiment. Human error while measuring blood pressure and heart rate could have also been a potential problem. Although our predications were confirmed by the results, our hypothesis was not completely accurate. Blood pressures after exposure to the hot water did lower, but after they rose initially. This resulted in a higher average blood pressure for the hot water results than the room temperature water results. An alternative hypothesis that would be more consistent with our results would state: blood pressure will increase after exposure to cold temperatures and decrease after a time of exposure to hot temperatures"""	skyesteve	2013-05-16 13:17:00	0	0
442	106	1	Congratulations on your successful experiment, Sam ! You have the potential to become a great cardiologist!It is important to think about research when it stares you in the eye.Reminds me of Werner Forßmann ( = Forssmann in English) who invented cardiac catheterization in 1929 ( only slightly less dangerous...). He was 25, a resident when he had a sudden idea and suggested to put a piece of rubber tube in his own arm vein to see if the heart could be reached safely. His boss refused to take part in this experiment, so the young doctor did it, with the help of a nurse, in his lunch break and walked several stairs down to have a CXR.He later published this, to the effect that he was fired on the spot by his boss, notorious surgeon F.Sauerbruch, who told him ( or rather shouted, if I remember the story well) that he could do these experiments in a circus, but not in a hospital.He was granted a Nobel prize in 1956, so it wasn´t all in vain, and since then, cardiac catheterization has made great progress...

I wonder how many doctors today would be prepared to do that? Although, I can feel us drifting slightly off topic here! If I'm not mistaken, with the discovery of insulin the first human tests were on the researchers themselves (Banting and Best, I believe). It must've taken tremendous courage and it certainly does test your own belief in your new theory!	samrneal	2013-05-16 16:31:00	0	0

The technique was called 'hydrotherapy'. The basic hypothesis was that mental illness is caused by increased intracranial blood pressure and vasculature, to reduce this a hot bath was made to help dilate blood vessels including cerebral ones.

Median survival after detection of metastatic disease is 12 months. [ 5 ]<br /><br /> Treatment for metastatic sarcoma is with palliative intent and thus guided by patient preference as well as performance status and disease extent. Surgical excision, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are all treatments that are considered in order to provide symptomatic relief from both the original tumour and metastatic disease. [ 1 ] [ 5 ]<br /><br /><br /> The phrase ""unplanned excision (of a tumour)"" refers to the resection of mass, which is presumed to be benign, without appropriate preoperative imaging, biopsy, or attention to surgical margins, as in the above case. Re-excision of a tumour is often required. The patient must undergo an additional surgical procedure that may lead to increased morbidity. Hence it is important to avoid unplanned excision of lumps and bumps without imaging, both in the primary and secondary care settings.<br /><br /> Up to 40% of patients presenting to regional sarcoma centres have undergone previous unplanned excision of their sarcomas. [ 14 ] Unplanned excision invariably results in tumour positive margins and therefore a higher risk of local recurrence and need for further surgery. A 2008 study found that 59% of patients who had an unplanned excision had residual tumour present on re-excision. [ 15 ]<br /><br /> In order to prevent unplanned excisions, it is important that referring clinicians recognise the features of a soft tissue lump that could be indicative of a sarcoma.<br /><br /> Patients referred to a regional sarcoma centre after an unplanned excision will require the following:<br /><br /><br />  Review of histology by a specialist pathologist<br /><br />  MRI imaging of the area of previous surgery<br /><br />  Staging CT scan of the chest to exclude pulmonary metastases<br /><br />  Wide re-excision is then carried out to reduce the risk of local recurrence.<br /><br /><br /> Ref :-  BMJ  learning modules"	alaminium	2016-05-11 00:43:00	0	0

470	111	1	Abstract  1<br /><br /> Insulin Pump for Type 2 Diabetes<br /><br /> Progressive hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes results from a progressive β-cell failure together with a state of insulin resistance (1). Insulin deficiency worsens with the natural progression of type 2 diabetes, explaining the escape from oral antihyperglycemic agents and the need for exogenous insulin therapy (2).<br /><br /> The use of external pumps in patients with type 2 diabetes is a recent practice compared with that in type 1 diabetes, and its use is still debated. In only a few countries, such as in France and Israel, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external pump is an alternative in type 2 diabetes that the health authorities have allowed for reimbursement. The rationale for using pump therapy was first suggested by its use in case reports of type 2 diabetes with extreme insulin resistance and poor glycemic control (3–6). In such patients, insulin was administered transiently by intravenous insulin infusion allowing lower mean glucose level despite a 40% reduction of insulin requirements. The sequential use of 4-week intravenous insulin infusion followed by 1-year CSII in a group of patients with type 2 diabetes patients poorly controlled despite very high insulin requirements allowed a dramatic reduction of HbA1c (−3%, −9 mmol/mol), while insulin requirements were reduced by one-third. Such beneficial effects of CSII were attributed to increased insulin sensitivity assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study (7). These observations raised the question as to whether insulin continuous administration by a pump device gives an advantage compared with the conventional approach of insulin intensification by multiple daily injections (MDIs). The evidence base is still under debate and will be discussed in this review<br /><br /> Abstract   2<br /><br /> Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a promising therapy, but the clinical evidence supporting it is mixed. Large randomized controlled trials have concluded that CSII was equivalent to multiple daily injections (MDI), whereas smaller trials have concluded that CSII was superior. Simpler insulin regimens of CSII have been investigated for T2DM and may lead to improved outcomes. Future directions in this area include simpler insulin pumps and the use of concentrated insulins (U-500), neither of which has left the feasibility stage of research. CSII may be appropriate for some people with T2DM, especially those for whom MDI therapy has failed.	alaminium	2016-03-13 00:13:00	1	0

An old medical and life adage.<br /><br />The last diabetic patient on continuous subcutaneous insulin pump infusion (CSII) that I saw was a 22 years old young lady with type 1 diabetes since 9 years old, a wealthy medical student with a private doctor and using CSII for 6 years. Her HBA1C was stable at 6.0% and that information was enough for me regarding her glycaemic control. I was called because of a recent appearence of microalbuminuria (mean of 52 mg of albumin/g of creatinine on two consecutive spots morning urines). My requested ABPM showed normal BP levels but a small decrease in the systolic BP decrease during sleep. So I started her on ramipril 10 mg at night with a follow-up after about 1 year with me as her BP and albuminuria doctor. I advised her private doctor to bring her HBA1C closest to normal ""as possible"" without Hypos (easy task right?).  <br /><br />I will move on with my opinion in the next post."

487	113	1	We read with interest the recent BMJ editorial “Rivaroxaban:Can we trust the evidence”.1 which questions the conclusions from the ROCKET AF clinical trial on Rivaroxaban 2. Cohen raises questions about the accuracy of the INRs used for monitoring patients in the warfarin control arm and suggests that they may have compromised the validity of the published conclusions. The ROCKET investigators have defended their conclusions after re assessing the data in light of these concerns 3. The device used for INR testing in the warfarin control arm was not identified in the original publication but subsequently has been revealed as the INRatio Point of Care (POC) device. This device was the subject of a safety recall notice by FDA in 2014 due to “clinically significantly lower” readings compared to laboratory values, with the fault going back to 2002 (before the Rocket AF trial started). The BMJ editorial points out that a falsely low INR reading could mean that patients in the control arm may have had their warfarin dose unnecessarily increased leading to a greater risk of bleeding.<br /><br /> To ensure accuracy, POC INR testing should be subjected to the same level of quality control (QC) and quality management systems that laboratory INR testing has to meet. Appropriate and effective External Quality Assessment (EQA) for POC INR testing devices is possible 4 and there has been a POC INR EQA programme available in the UK for 20 years. In the UK NEQAS for Blood Coagulation EQA programmes we provide suitable material for several different devices and have over 4500 users enrolled in the programmes (January 2016). The POC device used in the warfarin control arm of the ROCKET AF study 2 is one which we evaluated to assess our EQA material suitability in 2010 but found we were unable to provide any suitable EQA material for this technology. To our knowledge no other programme provides EQA for this device. The lack of EQA and internal quality control (IQC) makes it difficult to assess the reliability of INR results obtained with this device.<br /><br /> Laboratory based INR testing in many countries is subject to accreditation, often against international ISO standards (ISO 15189) 5 which require participation in regular EQA as part of the quality management system. Currently the vast majority of POC INR testing in many countries is not subject to such accreditation and not all POC sites participate in EQA even when this is available. Although such participation for POC sites is not currently mandated by regulation, we believe it should be obligatory. Non-participation despite availability could have serious medico-legal implications in the event of untoward incidents. If the use of INR methods in the laboratory or in point of care was restricted to those for which satisfactory participation in EQA can be demonstrated, the issues of clinically significant problems in INR testing such as those which have led to the questioning of the ROCKET AF study could be more easily avoided.<br /><br /> POC INR testing has been in use for over two decades and in our view is safe, providing continuous QC assessment is in place in order to ensure that the INR results produced are valid and accurate 6.There are several published national and international guidelines stating the essential requirement for QC to ensure reliable results 7-9 when using POC INR devices. It would be inappropriate to view all POC devices for INR testing to be inferior to the laboratory measurements as this is not usually the case. POC devices can be accurate and precise giving reliable results in a very quick turnaround time. The key is to ensure the accuracy and precision of all INR results, whether derived from a POC device or from a laboratory method, with the use of both internal control and external quality assessment.  <br /><br />  <br /><br />References<br /><br /> 1.Cohen D.

488	113	1	This Abstract confirms the variation between conventional methods of  INR testing and POC INR testing devices<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Abstract<br /><br /><br />External quality assessment (EQA) or proficiency testing is widely considered to be necessary for International Normalised Ratio (INR) determinations performed in conventional laboratory settings. There is increasing use of near-patient-test (NPT) or point-of-care (POC) INR devices and it is not known whether EQA is also necessary for these monitors. We report here on six years experience of proficiency testing for POC monitors used by health care professionals. Three devices were used by >10 centres who participated in the programme, the CoaguChek (CUC), the CUC-S and the TAS or Rapidpoint Coag. Not all users of the same type of monitor obtained the same INR result when analysing the same plasma sample. For the three monitors the CV of results in different centres was 11-14%. The variation between results in different centres could relate to inappropriately handled proficiency testing material, inaccuracies in the calibration of the system by the manufacturer or deterioration during transport/storage of the test strips. In each survey 10-11% of centres using POC monitors obtained INR results which were >15% different from those in other centres using the same monitors. For hospital laboratories using conventional INR techniques this figure was 12%. The relationship between INR results obtained by users of the Rapidpoint Coag or TAS monitor and results obtained by conventional techniques was not constant over the period of study. During one period INRs with TAS were 13.7% greater than with conventional methods. For the remaining three time periods results were similar. Our data suggest that the variation between INR results determined with three POC monitors show similar variation to that observed in hospital laboratories using conventional methods. Based on our data we recommend that users of these POC monitors participate regularly in an independent external proficiency testing programme.<br /><br />   <br /><br />   <br /><br />  Ref :-   Thromb Haemost. 2006 Nov;96(5):590-6.	alaminium	2016-04-11 22:04:00	0	0

492	115	1	I have grown old - unavoidable. i have not grown fat over the years - avoidable. What interests me is how I am being put at relative risk as well as inconvenience by the latter. <br /><br /> 2 examples in health care. 1) For x-rays the standard exposure means an overdiagnosis of bone thinning. This led to bone densitometry - with the verdict that bones better than average for age. 2) For some drugs the dose is administered depending on the eGFR but this test seems very poorly understood and bodyweight is a crucial part of it. The problem is that the lab value is based on a weight I have never achieved even at my heaviest and my true eGFR is significantly lower than the value on the report. (Of course for most eGFR values it does not matter as the trend is what is significant). The second adds to my recent experiences of a long standing hobby horse that many of those requesting tests do not know how to interpret the results......<br /><br /> Someone pointed out recently that having CT facilities for the markedly overweight might well mean more irradiation for the not so fat.<br /><br /> Outside medical care I am increasingly aware of being disadvantaged by being what was seen as normal weight in times gone by as the UK at least caters more and more for the obese. I suppose the answer is that if I don't like it I should add to the number and put on a few stone?	sken	2016-02-25 20:40:00	0	0
493	116	1	In a patient with known prior CAD s/p stent, recent improved/ negative nuclear stress test 1 week prior for similar symptoms-presented with some 'atypical' chest pain(on sub-optimal anti-anginal therapy), no EKG changes, ctrop neg X2-chest pain free in ER. Should a patient like this be admitted for diagnostic cath/some other tests or be discharged on optimal medical therapy?To add to the dilemma-this happens on a Friday afternoon(if further work-up needed, pt will have to stay over weekend, with additional LOS/expense/inconvenience etc).

494	116	1	Difficult ,some of medicine is about managing risk in a reasonable manner for the patient. Sometimes it is useful to think what would I want if I, or a member of my family, were in the patients position. <br /><br /> I am not a cardiologist, but I would check with my colleagues and probably discuss options with the patient and possibly with the patients relatives and if they were in agreement not admit. Lots of safety netting. One of the NHS problems if that any outpatients follow up might involve a significant delay. Another ,and in my view major problem ,with the NHS is that there are far too few hospital beds.	PatLush	2016-02-12 08:17:00	0	0
495	116	1	Would it be too radical to suggest that an 'ER' (possibly this patient was not in the UK) doctor attempts at least a clinical differential diagnosis for the pain' based on features in the history and examination?  'Non-cardiac pain' is not a sufficient diagnosis with which to send a patient home. 'Atypical' presumably means not typical of ischaemic cardiac pain.   None of the tests results mean this pain couldn't still be due to myocardial ischaemia but at least consider other places in which the pain could originate, including upper gastrointestinal tract, biliary tract, aorta, pleura, chest wall or spine.  Patients appreciate some attempt at a reasoned explanation for their pain, even when this comes with the caveat that it's provisional.  Without even attempting this it's difficult to choose from 'some other tests'.  Simply excluding immediately life-threatening cardiac ischaemia should never be the end of assessment of chest pain.  Neither is the stock suggestion 'probably GORD'.<br /><br /> As we've seen in several cases, having insufficient beds and investigation facilities over a weekend is unlikely be an acceptable excuse if a patient is discharged and comes to harm.  What it does demonstrate, dear Mr Hunt, is that any extra number of junior doctors working at weekends on reduced pay is ever going to solve the problem of providing abdominal ultrasounds, echocardiograms or CT scans.

498	116	1	Thank you for that additional information, Heartfelt, but no, I don't think it changes the picture/plan appreciably.  I agree with Joey that the best advice would be to admit for at least 12 hours to check that there have been no other developments to worsen the prognosis.  As Joey and Pat point out, the patient's views carry at least equal weight.  If all stable the next day; discharge with a provisional diagnosis and clear guaranteed plan for early review. The weekend/beds circumstances really don't carry much weight if the clinical advice with patient's agreement is to admit.

500	117	1	I think that it becomes more and more apparent that there are not enough NHS Hospital beds. I think most of the A and E problems would be made better if there were more  Hospital beds. <br /><br /> Many hospital beds have been lost though hospital closures and amalgamations.<br /><br /> There has been great emphasis on community care and early discharge. But there are patients who cannot be managed in the community and need admission. There is a huge pressure not to admit patients and also pressure to discharge patients early.<br /><br /> Success in Hospital now seems to be discharging patients from Hospital rather than caring for them and when possible curing them.<br /><br /> My opinion is that we need more and not less Hospital beds.	PatLush	2016-01-17 23:01:00	0	0
501	117	1	Maxim<br /><br /> Thanks<br /><br /> Yes I think that some of the younger GPs would like to look after appropriate patients in cottage hospitals. The problem seems to be that accountants looking, from a rather narrow view point , deem cottage hospitals to be too expensive.	PatLush	2016-01-18 12:54:00	0	0
502	117	1	Pat<br /><br /> It might be important first to decide what sorts of patients need the hospital beds. Just providing more generic beds for 'medical patients' would probably just result in their being used as very expensive recuperation facilities. There is certainly a lack of beds for some types of patients, for example with serious acute psychiatric problems.<br /><br /> whatever beds are provided they have to be fully financed and staffed. Moving money from hospitals to community while sending more patients to hospital is a disgrace.<br /><br /> Perhaps some GPs would like to return to the practice of looking after appropriate patients in community/cottage hospitals?

503	118	1	For now I think the news that 35% of UK doctors were born elsewhere is good news. This applies to very many of our senior folk - particularly from India - and many with a wealth of Uk qualifications as well. I see this as a recruitment of excellence. But I suspect we are in period of transition and in future the influx will be from Europe. It would be interesting to see the equivalent figures from the USA.<br /><br /> If this 35% still applies in 20 years time I would be more concerned (except I won't be around).. Is there really going to be an exodus of UK graduates : I seriously doubt it despite mutterings. Perhaps our projected needs for numbers will not be met from UK born and net immigration will remain large.<br /><br /> At the other end of the scale is Poland with only 2.7 % foreign born. Perhaps a combination of language and historical issues and Poland not so attractive for foreign high-fliers help to explain the disparity? Or perhaps Poland produces just the right number of doctors through its own training programmes.	sken	2015-12-29 22:53:00	0	0
504	118	1	"I know this isn't a peer-reviewed academic journal, sken, but it is useful to give a reference for a fact that you use in your argument.   Where did yours come from, please?<br /><br /> I'd say the proportion of NHS doctors who qualified outside the UK is more important that where they came from.   I don't know what proportion would indicate that the UK is unable to train sufficient doctors, but if the number was as high as 35% I'd say that was a concern.<br /><br /> I don't think that Poland is a fair comparison.    It is an unusual country, one that didn't exist for many years in our preceeding centuries, and where, like Welsh or Irish, the language and nationhood was suppressed.    And one occupied by the Soviets without a significant indigenous Russian population, unlike some other Baltic states.  As a result, the West was excluded while immigration fro the East was most unwelcome, and the Polish medical cadre was entirely home grown.   And very good at it, in the hard circumstances of comunist rule!<br /><br /> How about France?  In 2007, 14% of doctors in France and 3% of nurses were not born in France (OECD International Migration Outlook: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rMXVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=Where+were+French+doctors+born?&source=bl&ots=f4U2iGWVXc&sig=OarU4QCGZwW8jfzDJOo8TitGdeY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinj67BwoPKAhWKOhQKHZj0AmAQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&q=Where%20were%20French%20doctors%20born%3F&f=false )  after those born in Algeria when that was French departement and so with French nationality were excluded.<br /><br /> From the same publication, eight years ago, and in Europe overall, 18% of doctors and 11% of nurses were not born in their contry of employment.  The following table shows the proportion of foreign trained doctors in a a number of OECD countries, in the '70s and 2005:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     Per centages<br /><br /><br /><br />     ‘70s<br /><br /><br /><br />     2005<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     Australia<br /><br /><br /><br />     24<br /><br /><br /><br />     25<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     Canada<br /><br /><br /><br />     31<br /><br /><br /><br />     22<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     Germany<br /><br /><br /><br />     5<br /><br /><br /><br />     5<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     Finland<br /><br /><br /><br />     1<br /><br /><br /><br />     7<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     France<br /><br /><br /><br />     1<br /><br /><br /><br />     6<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     United Kingdom<br /><br /><br /><br />     26<br /><br /><br /><br />     33<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     Netherlands<br /><br /><br /><br />     1<br /><br /><br /><br />     6<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     New Zealand<br /><br /><br /><br />     27<br /><br /><br /><br />     36<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     Portugal<br /><br /><br /><br />     1<br /><br /><br /><br />     5<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     Sweden<br /><br /><br /><br />     5<br /><br /><br /><br />     16<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />     United States<br /><br /><br /><br />     22<br /><br /><br /><br />     25<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> This shows that about half of foreign born French doctors trained in France and that your ""35%"" of foreign born doctors in the UK, if that also means trained abroad, hasn't changed that much in forty years.   The NHS has certainly not fallen apart under the care of our foreign trained colleagues, indeed many would say that without them it would have done so, long ago.<br /><br /> John"	John D	2015-12-30 12:16:00	0	0
505	118	1	John D – Many thanks. The numbers with a first qualification in the UK is I think a separate if related issue and one has to make do sometimes with data as it becomes available.  My data featured in almost every UK national paper and is based on the figures from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and development) , although I am not sure that the formal report has been published as yet. As you quote the same source I presume it is impeccable ….. This UK figure is (bar Luxembourg) apparently the highest in Europe , with Italy at 5% and Germany at 10%.<br /><br /> In terms of exporting doctors – the UK is second only to Germany as far as Europe is concerned.<br /><br /> Of course one can put various interpretations on this evidence. It would be interesting to know how many of the doctors we are exporting trained in the UK  were also born here. Is the UK a medical transit camp – providing highly regarded qualification before moving on ? Perhaps with the added factor that it is easier to move on from the UK than from some places of birth.<br /><br /> I think I was presenting less an argument than an observation : hence my title. Clearly many of the newspapers will look to the rather facile question as to why are not self-sufficient as regards medical question whereas the wider question is : do we need to be? The reason I gave Poland as an example of the other extreme was to emphasise that having a totally endogenous work force might not always be ideal either. I felt that you were a bit on the defensive , I have no doubt that the NHS owes an enormous debt to doctors born (and often initially trained ) abroad and that scarcely needs stating , but misses some of the point. It is also that this group often provides the doctors of excellence. This is great news for UK medicine – high fliers in my era had to fight some awful prejudice if they decided not to emigrate. I do not think either of the consultants whom I went out of my way to choose this year was born in the UK and there is a third in the pipeline.  2 of my  dentists whom I regarded very highly have come  from Libya and female to boot !<br /><br /> Our high dependence on foreign born nurses at 22% is again I think a separate issue and raises the question of whether recruitment as now promoted is ethical – there are differences from the medical personnel born abroad but receiving higher professional training whom we then filch.<br /><br />  The figure I would like most to see is the % of the coming generation of doctors who do not have parents who were born in the UK. This could well be very high.  My impression is that the Anglo-Saxon male is becoming less and less the norm in the profession for a whole variety of reasons and that is potentially a very good thing. It would be interesting to know what is happening in Scotland – except one might have to substitute something for the “Anglo-Saxon” prototype.	sken	2015-12-30 16:51:00	0	0
506	118	1	There are increasing numbers of foreign trained doctors in many countries. It is a general trend, in some countries more pronounced, in others less. Some of this trend is due to a higher rate of immigration of populations and moving from country to country. Another part is the influx of doctors that can't work at their native countries due to different circumstances, mostly economical( in Hungary a doctor earns a salary that cannot be considered suffucient to lead a normal economically balanced life). So people look for possibilities abroad. In some countries there is a shortage of doctors which is filled by the foreign dctors.<br /><br /> Some countries take in more freign doctors than others. Some are less popular targets for doctors to go there, be it economicl reasons or reasons that make it difficult to obtain a license to work at the specific country.	yoram chaiter	2016-01-02 10:35:00	0	0

509	120	1	A 72 year old male has had type 2 diabetes for six years. He is on metformin extended release 2.0 grs per day. He does not have any major cardiovascular disease. His last two routine HBA1C levels, taken within a four month period by his GP prior to this appointment, were stable at 9.1%.	Joey Rio	2016-02-22 11:57:00	3	0
510	120	1	Yes!<br /><br /> This patient who is 72 yrs old with HbA1C 9.1%  with short expectancy of life ,the HbA1C may be maintained around 7.5% keeping in mind about the cardiovascular complications in view of any Hypoglycemic event,even though  he has no h/o of cardiovascular  complications,I think, I may go in for a Sulfonylurea  long acting like GlynaseXL(glypizide) 10 mg twice daily to achieve the above target with metformin.

511	120	1	"Further information about this patient:<br /><br /> He is an upper middle class retired professional. His father was non-diabetic and had a sudden death at the age of 93, his mother died of cancer at 76. About 1 and a half years ago he had an appointment with his former GP (now working in another county ). He was on Ramipril 10 mg at night, Simvastatin 20 mg at night and the same 2.0 grs of metformin/day. His BP was normal - verified through ABPM. His BMI was 32, Abdominal circumference 114 cm, LDL-Cholesterol 132 mg/dL, TG: 240 mg/dL. EKG and Echocardiogram were both normal. Carotid ultrasound showed a small increase in its right internal media thickness, with no plaques. He was non-smoker but sedentary; and never took aspirin. His HBA1C had been stable at about 8.4% for the last year. His GP changed his Simvastatin  to Rosuvastatin (""Crestor"") 20 mg/day and referred him to a multidisciplinary diabetic team."	Joey Rio	2016-02-24 20:12:00	1	0
512	120	1	I find treating type 2 diabetes difficult. I really like finding a cure for patients and so much of modern medicine is treating surrogate measurements to reduce risk rather than trying to cure conditions. With more preventative medication elderly people tend to be on multiple medications and so the risk of side effects is higher. <br /><br /> I would probably ask the patient what he wanted. Did he have symptoms that troubled him or did he want to reduce his risks. I would ask him about his attitude to medication and whether he would accept side effects if they produced a significant reduction in risk from disabling illness and if medication was significantly lightly to reduce mortality<br /><br /> I have now retired from full time General Practice and I only do some GP locums in an OOH centre. I still very much enjoy the work, but I do miss some of the continuity of care. When I was a partner, if I had a worry with a diabetic patient had a partner who was very good with dealing with diabetic medications and I would have probably deferred to him. He unlike me was fairly keen on gliptins  [DPP4] and would have probably gone for option 2. With a chat about possible side effect of gliptins and a review appointment and a check on his blood tests.

514	120	1	The patient is 72 yrs old who had T2DM 6 years ago , what is missing is what is his eGFR ? If he has peripheral neuropathy or diabetic retinopathy? His HBA1C needs to be at or below 7% to decrease macro vascular complications, I wouldn't go for Sulphonylurea firstly because it puts him at risk for hypoglycemia & in his age he may be prone to falls, secondly because he will gain weight & he is already obese BMI 32 , I would go for number 2<br /><br /> I agree with Dr Chid that he needs to change his life style	msm 1972	2016-02-25 15:04:00	2	0
515	120	1	Definitely diet and lifestyle changes are needed. Right now with an HbA1c of 9.1 % it is very unlikely that the addition of an oral agent would bring it down to goal.	Arrhenius	2016-02-25 15:17:00	2	0

517	120	1	Yes i would start this patient on DPP4. He is obese therefore sulphonylurea will not be a good option as it will increase patient weight. Dpp4 will reduce the A1c by 0.8 to 1% reducing the current A1c to roughly 8%. Lifestyle modification like exercise, strict diabetic diet and weight reduction will help him to reduce his A1c for another 0.3-0.5% achieving the target ~ 7.5%	drlyd	2016-02-25 15:55:00	2	1
518	120	1	I would add sulphonyleura. Advice about lifestyle modification is also required. As the patient is 72 years old, use of gliptins may result in difficult side effects.	Liaqat	2016-02-25 16:30:00	3	0
519	121	1	The UK is currently in the throes of anguishing about whether to opt out of the EU.

523	121	1	Similarly unimpressed here. A future-changing decision has been reduced to a petty fear vs fear campaign. I suspect most people have a gut feeling and look for evidence to enforce it but, for the genuinely undecided, both campaigns offer little of substance. <br /><br /> Personally, I am in, all the way. The challenges of EU membership are widely enough recognised (without media nonsense about banana geometry) but we can't change it if we don't have a meangingful seat at the table.<br /><br /> However, my deepest concern is that the language and attitudes used by the Brexiters, especially the scapegoating and vilifying of immigrants, are only being normalised by this campaign. We may end up remaining but that won't change the fact that a large amount of people in this country have been whipped into a mess of anti-EU and anti-migrant sentiment -- and will be very, very bitter.	jeffnevil	2016-06-09 17:29:00	0	0
524	121	1	I heard the excellent Nick Robinson (Today, and previously the BBC's chief political reporter) talking about the Referendum Campaign on the Radio4.  Sorry, can't recall which programme.  He was as concerned as the above on the poor quality of debate and at the wild statistics that were being rattled.    He said that the Media, and especially the BBC,  was well-equipped to criticise the inflated and demolish the ridiculous, but could not, for fear of losing their impartiality.     If it was the BBC who threw out the Brexit claim of Biblically enormous sums being paid to Europe every week, or that it was foreign (=European) rapists who were terrorising the womenfolk of England, they would lose they precious neutrality.   Not in those words, of course - he was too diplomatic.<br /><br /> This is a problem, and while I hesitate to invoke previous demagogues (especially those with toothbrush moustaches in the style of Charlie Chaplin)  it is the same as the Big Lie, one so enormous that anyone receiving it will think, no one could say that if it wasn't true, and so believe it!     That style of politics was unimpeded by the Media of the time, which did not hold the tenets of impartial reporting that our Media do today.   Would that they had, but look!   Even our best journalists are determined to investigate and expose crooked Panamanian accountants, but allow the most blatently ridiculous statement by partial politicians to go, if not unchecked but uncriticised.    How can we free them to pursue political bias, while still keeping them neutral, and seen as neutral?<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-06-10 21:40:00	0	0
525	122	1	What would you do with a 45 YO complicated diabetic patient with diabetes since 1998 and creatinine level of 2.31 with hypertention that is not controlled by enalapril 40 mg per day, aldospiron 25 mg per day, bisoprolol 5 mg per day, he can not tolerate amlodipine because of leg edema.<br />Please share your thoughts.

526	122	1	Hello Yaron:<br /><br /><br /><br />  It looks like he has resistant hypertension secondary to diabetic nephropathy already in stage 3 to 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 3 to 4).<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Salt is a very important issue in diabetic and CKD hypertension.<br /><br />   <br /><br />  This is what I would try with her:<br /><br />   <br /><br />  - Severe dietary salt restriction.<br /><br />  - Get rid of any Anti-Inflammatory drugs.<br /><br />  - Keep the Enalapril on top of the 40 mg/day dose.<br /><br />  - Add Furosemide 80 to 160 mg in two divided doses per day in addition to the spironolactone.<br /><br />  - Change the Nevibolol for Carvedilol, just because of my larger personal experience with carvedilol and also for a higher dose range with Carvedilol (I could begin with, for example, 6,25 mg twice a day increasing up to 12,5 or even 25 mg twice a day, in just a few weeks).<br /><br /><br /> - I would definetely give another chance to amlodipine, 10 mg at bedtime. Together with High dose furosemide, things can get better.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> And so, He would be on 4 classes of anti-hypertensive drugs, with nice doses:<br /><br /> Enalapril, Amlodipine, Carvedilol, Furosemide, and Spironolactone.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Hope it helps,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> All best,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Joey	Joey Rio	2011-05-23 02:06:00	0	0
527	122	1	Hallo Joy<br />Thank you for your important comments.<br />The patient (he) is not on NSAIDs.<br />He is on low salt diet.<br />I was concerned about the combination of enalapril and aldospiron in CKD because of the possibility of hyperkalemia. Aren't you? What would be your reco for kalium blood level monitoring schedule?<br />He has microalbuminoria of 1.7 gr/l and his microalbumin/creatinine ratii is 3.8 - dose it make a difference in your management ?

528	122	1	Well .... its understood that other causes of resistant BP such as renal art. stenosis, are ruled out by detail lab and imaging work up.Presently, whats the status of her diabetes? HbA1C estimates? Is she on any anti-diabetic drugs and or OHA?Whats her current Insulin portocol? I would first stabilize blood glucose ... mainly with insulin ...naturally multiple regime.For BP to be <130/90 ... ACE, ARB, (with close monitoring of electrolytes) CCB, B-blokers, diurteics, with low salt and low protein diet are indicated - as tolerated to maximum doses. Other complicating co-morbidities like anaemia, hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, etc. should be treated with erythropoietin, calcium, vit D. Some advocate advance vascular access - about 3 to 6 months in advance of anticipated dialysis - for replacement therapy.	csm@csm	2011-05-23 05:12:00	0	0

I saw him for the first time yesterday in my volunteer diabetes consulting clinic in a low socioeconomic area. I instructed him to measure blood glucose 5 times daily and to elevate the lantus by 2 units every 3 days till morning blood glucose is lower than 140.

530	122	1	Hello Yaron …. A significant point that I have noted in your comments above is that this middle-aged patient, with chronic disease burden, is from low socio-economic strata. Against such a background, I would work up this case as best suits patient’s autonomy and beneficence, including financial constraints, and not by the dictates of the EBM or guidelines, which will certainly be a tall order to follow for this poor patient. I strongly believe in the concept of ‘patient-centered’ approach, and I certainly appreciate your approach – not to push things at first meeting till you are certain of compliance with drug regime. And based on similar logic, I suppose, I will plan investigations, if they add value to his management.   With a history of PVD / amputation, one may like to rule out PAN, or vasculitis, by tests such as ANCA, and a biopsy; but again, as the disease is well advanced, will it be beneficial? If positive, again the role of steroids / immuno modulators has to be assessed, because of the added immunodeficiency risk and upset diabetic control. I would prefer to just manage his  lipid profile a bit more aggressively with Atorvastatin only ( for other statins dose adjustment is recommended, depending on creatinine clearance and GFR), add cilostazol, aspirin, PPI, in a step-wise regime, as best tolerated by him; but the cornerstone of his management is – a fairly well glycemic control with insulin. Your plan of Lantus insulin with graded dose of Apidra rapid insulin as per blood glucose values is fine, and FBG values around 100 and PP / random around 150 must be targeted without hypos; however, variable response to insulin as CKD progresses needs careful monitoring. If the total dose of insulin is escalating, then a small dose of glipizide (which dose not need dose adjustment in renal insufficiency), is a good option. Although FDA has permitted ‘gliptins’ – Onglyza- in moderate to severe renal impairment, including ESRD, its high cost is a deterrent in this particular patient.     As for anti-hypertensives – beta-blockers should be excluded as there is h/o PVD; ace/arb with loop diuretics, and since he can not tolerate CCB due to pedal edema, well titrated alfa-blockers and centrally acting α2-adrenoceptor agonists may play a positive role in controlling resistant hypertension. Just a bit more counselling with respect to their side effects will enhance his cooperation in drug-dosage adherence.  Another point that I must state is that - over here, many patients, poor or rich alike , take varieties of herbal products containing heavy metals for many diseases ( IHD, DM, arthritis, cirrhosis of liver, HIV, CKD, etc) in the hope of a ‘magic cure’. And unless you question them directly, this goes unnoticed, and the truth comes out when it’s too late for some remedy. So, this aspect has to be probed, especially in the early stages of consultation.   With all the tools that we presently have to deal with CKD with DM and hypertension, its possible to delay further renal deterioration, and to achieve goal,  whole-hearted physician-patient relationship is extremly important.	csm@csm	2011-05-23 13:18:00	0	0

Disagreements? questions that might help to suggest the best practice for this poor 45 YO patient? Comments are welcome.Posted by YaronDears  Yaron and Csm:You are right about the dangers with Hyperkalemia. High dose Furosemide should antagonize that as long as the patient has enough diuresis and serum creatinine keeps below 3.0. Any way K should be closely monitored. But perhaps espirolactone could be left away from his treatment at this point. But I think high dose furosemide is a must for him.As Csm suggested, I also think, Atorvastatin is really a good shot for him.Regarding his Peripheral Vascular Disease, the first generation beta-blockers are clearly contra-indicated, but that is not the case for the newer ones as carvedilol.Now, let-me call you both the attention for this interesting recent article written by a nephrologist from the United States about diabetic patients with Chronic Kidney Disease, using much higher than usual doses of Lisinopril (up to 80mg/day) in single daily administrations. The authors obtained a measurably good effect on blood pressure and albuminuria. But Potassium should be closely monitored. I found it a really interesting and new way of treating those high-risk diabetic patients such as yours. The abstract Follows.Hope it helps. All Best. Joey.Journal of Investigative MedicineISSN: 1081-5589(C) 2010 American Federation for Medical ResearchEffective Antihypertensive Strategies for High-Risk Patients WithDiabetic Nephropathypg. 950-956DOI: 10.231/JIM.0b013e3181ff46a5 AB Aim: Clinical guidelines recommend blood pressure (BP) lowering and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition to slow kidney disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy. This study's purpose was to determine whether an antihypertensive regimen including a maximally dosed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor could safely achieve target BP in indigent, predominantly minority patients with this disease. Methods: We studied 81 hypertensive adults (52% Hispanic and 31% African American) with nephropathy attributed to type 1 or 2 diabetes during the run-in period of a randomized controlled trial. The subjects received lisinopril titrated to 80 mg daily and additional antihypertensives to target a systolic BP (SBP) lower than 130 mm Hg. Blood pressure and serum potassium level were measured weekly, and a 4-gram sodium diet was prescribed. The primary outcome variable was SBP change from screening to randomization. Success in achieving SBP goal, change in urine albumin-creatinine ratio, hyperkalemia (serum potassium >=5.5 mmol/L) and hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg) were also analyzed. Results: The median SBP decreased from 144 to 133 mm Hg (median change, -9.6%.) Fifty-eight (71%) achieved goal SBP during run-in. The median UACR decreased from 206.8 to 112.7 mg/mmol (median change, -42.7%). The UACR reduction correlated with SBP reduction. Seventeen subjects experienced hyperkalemia responsive to dietary/medical management. Two subjects experienced hypotension responsive to medication adjustments. Conclusion: A regimen using a maximally dosed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is safe and effective for achieving BP goal in high-risk, predominantly minority patients with diabetic nephropathy. Implementing this regimen necessitates close monitoring of serum potassium level. (C) 2010 American Federation for Medical Research	Joey Rio	2011-05-24 04:51:00	0	0
532	122	1	Well scholars! I am late enterant. So much discussed so beautifully. Yaron has given the history in installments which is good.I think we must set two goals first in this patient.Desired:       HBA1C = < 6.5 %       Fasting = < 100 mg/dl       Random = < 140 mg/dl       B.P         = < 110/80       Hb         = 9.2 gm; good enough.In assessment of renal function Creatinine clearance should be the guide. One good point about prognosis: This patient still has lot of renal reserve as so much inuslin is being needed.I would have gone with combination of regular and NPH insulin cosidering socioeconomic class.About antihypertensives/Pedal edema is harmless. Secondly while adding frusamide and already being used ACE, it should not be limiting factor, although tachycardia can be a discomfort.I would go with following regime;Frosamide 40 mg 8 hourlyAmlodipine 5 mg 12 hourlyRamipril 10 mg bidCarvidolol (Nebivolol) 12.5 bidIf this does not achieve target BP then I have something else in store.	ranasaleem	2011-05-25 09:44:00	0	0
533	123	1	Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980—2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013<br /><br /> The Lancet, Early Online Publication, 29 May 2014 doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8Cite or Link Using DOI<br /><br />Summary<br /><br /> Background<br /><br /> In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3·4 million deaths, 3·9% of years of life lost, and 3·8% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980—2013.<br /><br /> Methods<br /><br /> We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19 244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).<br /><br /> Findings<br /><br /> Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28·8% (95% UI 28·4—29·3) to 36·9% (36·3—37·4) in men, and from 29·8% (29·3—30·2) to 38·0% (37·5—38·5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23·8% (22·9—24·7) of boys and 22·6% (21·7—23·6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8·1% (7·7—8·6) to 12·9% (12·3—13·5) in 2013 for boys and from 8·4% (8·1—8·8) to 13·4% (13·0—13·9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50% in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down.<br /><br /> Interpretation<br /><br /> Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> COMMENT: While we in the West were wringing our hands about the increase in overweight and obesity in our own countries, we or atleast I for one did not appreciate just how widespread and pervasive this epidemic was.  Given this worldwide increase and acceleration of obesity, the calculations for future prevalence of obesity must surely be underestimates.  As if the data presented were not depressing enough, the statement that no country has yet succeeded in reversing this trend is an indication of the uphill battle we have before us.	diabetesMD	2014-06-09 08:36:00	0	0
534	123	1	There was an interesting article in the BMJ a few weeks back by John Appleby, a health economist, which showed that in the UK the average BMI of children had decreased from a high of 18.9 in 2004 to around 18.15 in 2012. A crumb of comfort perhaps...	AnneG	2014-06-09 10:02:00	0	0
535	123	1	Yes, the CDC reported a similar decrease in 2-5-year-olds in the US.  And sugary pop consumption is also decreasing in that age group.  Let's hold our breath.  Here's the abstract:<br /><br /> Prevalence of Childhood and Adult Obesity in the United States, 2011-2012<br /><br />JAMA. 2014;311(8):806-814. doi:10.1001/jama.2014.732.<br /><br /> ABSTRACT<br /><br />Importance  More than one-third of adults and 17% of youth in the United States are obese, although the prevalence remained stable between 2003-2004 and 2009-2010.<br /><br />Objective  To provide the most recent national estimates of childhood obesity, analyze trends in childhood obesity between 2003 and 2012, and provide detailed obesity trend analyses among adults.<br /><br />Design, Setting, and Participants  Weight and height or recumbent length were measured in 9120 participants in the 2011-2012 nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.<br /><br />Main Outcomes and Measures  In infants and toddlers from birth to 2 years, high weight for recumbent length was defined as weight for length at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. In children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific CDC BMI-for-age growth charts. In adults, obesity was defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 30. Analyses of trends in high weight for recumbent length or obesity prevalence were conducted overall and separately by age across 5 periods (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012).<br /><br />Results  In 2011-2012, 8.1% (95% CI, 5.8%-11.1%) of infants and toddlers had high weight for recumbent length, and 16.9% (95% CI, 14.9%-19.2%) of 2- to 19-year-olds and 34.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-37.9%) of adults (age-adjusted) aged 20 years or older were obese. Overall, there was no significant change from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012 in high weight for recumbent length among infants and toddlers, obesity in 2- to 19-year-olds, or obesity in adults. Tests for an interaction between survey period and age found an interaction in children (P = .03) and women (P = .02). There was a significant decrease in obesity among 2- to 5-year-old children (from 13.9% to 8.4%; P = .03) and a significant increase in obesity among women aged 60 years and older (from 31.5% to 38.1%; P = .006).<br /><br />Conclusions and Relevance  Overall, there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. Obesity prevalence remains high and thus it is important to continue surveillance.	diabetesMD	2014-06-09 10:22:00	0	0
536	123	1	As a student back in the 1960s I was taught time and again about the problems of lifestyle and obesity with examples from the UK and elsewhere in the world. The UK now accepts that 10% of our budget will go on obesity - more than the entire budget for General Practice. The epidemic has been arising fairly remorselessly and has been well publicised. We should stop thinking that we will be able to make appreciable inroads now and plan on how much extra tax will be needed for this. We will of course wrap it up by saying it is for extra nurses or whatever. <br /><br /> Society has just acquiesced and adapted even to the point of disadvantaging those who have tried to maintain a BMI under 25. Diabetologists are not blameless - perhaps they should have been flagging up these problems politically rather than just trying to grab resources for care of the end disease? What will they do if everyone becomes thin (as we now refer to those with a normal BMI) overnight.... are there enough with Type 1 to keep them all in employment? As things are they need have no worries.	sken	2014-06-09 15:18:00	0	0
537	123	1	I agree with Sken, this could have been tackled properly some years ago but apathy and vested interests seem to have conspired so that we're left with handwringing and gastric banding.  If a near-pandemic on this scale had been a serious infection disease there would have been a state of emergency.<br /><br /> Within my lifetime the great majority of people have been slim and rationing might have prevented epidemics of chronic disease had the authorities and medical profession not encouraged most adults to smoke!  My point is simply that the obesity crisis has come about through changes in public eating habits (and fall in exercise) and I can't see that anything less than state-controlled reversal of the cause is ever going to work.

538	123	1	Let’s carry that cigarette comparison farther.  When I was growing up the most popular radio and later TV shows were sponsored by tobacco companies.  I especially remember Your Hit Parade sponsored by Lucky Strike cigarettes and the Arthur Godfrey show sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes, but there were many more.  Here is what the Wikipedia says about that era:<br /><br /> “The decades in the 20th century prior to World War II consisted primarily of full page, color magazine and newspaper advertisements. Many companies created slogans for their specific cigarettes and also gained endorsements from famous men and women. Some advertisements even contained children or doctors in their efforts to sway new customers to their specific brand. Much of these advertisements sought to make smoking appear fashionable and modern to men and women. Also, since the health effects of smoking weren't entirely proven at this time, the only real opposing argument to smoking was made on moral grounds. However, there were still a substantial amount of doctors and scientists who believed there was a health risk associated with smoking cigarettes.[6] During World War II, cigarettes were included in American soldier's C-rations since many tobacco companies sent the soldiers cigarettes for free. Cigarette sales reached an all time high at this point, as cigarette companies were not only able to get soldiers addicted to tobacco, but specific brands also found a new loyal group of customers as soldiers who smoked their cigarettes returned from the war.”<br /><br /> So what happened to change that?  First, there was the science that culminated in the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health.  The report although dated 1964 was actually available earlier.  Our Chairman of Medicine, Dr. John Hickam, was on the panel.  It may be hard to imagine today, but in the 1960’s we smoked in our medical school classes and the projector lighted up the blue haze that surrounded us.  Following the report virtually the entire class quit smoking as did the majority of physicians in the US.<br /><br /> It was nearly 20 years from that time until smoking became socially unacceptable to everyone except the 20% of hard cases, mostly lower income and education, that still smoke in the US.  However, it would be an error to think that the success of smoking cessation programs was a matter of science and public health messages.  The estimated $50 billion tobacco advertising budget dwarfed the public health message budget by a 100-fold.<br /><br /> It was only when the Attorneys General of the various states collaborated with the tort bar that the public health messages received adequate funding via billions of dollars in law suit settlements over the individual state’s medical expenses for caring for people with smoking-related diseases.<br /><br /> So there are two messages here for those of us concerned about the obesity epidemic.  The first is that we need convincing science that the increase in obesity has causal entities that bear responsibility for the epidemic.  Within the past few years there have been both scientific studies and lay publications that place the responsibility of this epidemic largely at the feet of the manufactured food industry.  Among the most powerful is the book Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us by Michael Moss and the documentary film “Super Size Me”, a 2004 documentary directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock, an American independent filmmaker.  Spurlock's film follows a 30-day period from February 1 to March 2, 2003 during which he ate only McDonald's food. The film documents this lifestyle's drastic effect on Spurlock's physical and psychological well-being, and explores the fast food industry's corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit.<br /><br /> The second is that we need to institute measures that make the manufacture and marketing of these manufactured foods increasing unprofitable, while also making their marketing increasingly socially unacceptable.  This will take time and it will not be a short or linear process.   Perhaps we need to revisit the Attorneys General strategy of taking to court those who make and sell these foods and make them pay for the resultant medical costs.<br /><br /> While I am not sure that we have the answers yet, we certainly are on our way the defining the question.  Einstein is quoted as having said that if he had one hour to save the world he would spend fifty-five minutes defining the problem and only five minutes finding the solution.	diabetesMD	2014-06-10 06:24:00	0	0
539	123	1	"Many thanks diabetesMD. One of the crucial differences between smoking and obesity is that smokers paid for there health care whereas the obese simply expect others to pick up the bill. I remember the argument that the UK could not afford to ban smoking due to loss of revenue and people surviving longer. <br /><br /> I am surprised that so many were smoking in medical classes in the 1960s - it suggests an analogy with obese folk not  facing up to the fact until someone tells them they are obese. I think in the UK smoking was already accepted medically as ""a bad thing"" by then. (One of my teachers was reported to have grabbed a packet of cigarettes from a patient and jumped on them). Officially until relatively late in the day , UK coroners might refuse to accept a death certificate blaming smoking. And we still behave with a 2-faced dishonesty that is mind -boggling , bearing in mind the current policies to oblige some other countries to allow tobacco to be pushed - those seen as non-western do not count when profits are concerned. It is all remarkably reminiscent of the old opium wars and selling weapons etc...<br /><br /> There are a number of reasons why doctors choose not to smoke - one is the simple self-centred approach about their own health. Others I thnk are concerned about setting an example. The latter to some extent extended to having alcohol at day-time meetings - this was first discouraged and then discontinued. We have remained very ambivalent about setting an example in terms of exercise and obesity. There are some very obese , very good doctors out there , but perhaps a simple policy that at some stage -say 20 years hence - morbid obesity would be seen as contrindication to a career in medical care , would not go amiss. And that should apply as of now to those who appear in the media talking about healthy lifestyles etc.. - particularly to those involved in running the health services."	sken	2014-06-10 09:11:00	0	0
540	123	1	Diabetes MD<br /><br /> Thanks for the valuable references and links on this and other topics.  My memories of smoke-filled student days are similar to yours.  Even the teachers smoked in classes.  Speaking as someone who has never smoked, the bans on public place smoking here have greatly enhanced life. <br /><br /> There is a disconnect between academic research and Government policies.  If administrations are fighting change they demand unreasonable levels of proof but if, often for dubious reasons, certain policies are being pushed, the need for evidence can be waived.  In the case of the NHS reforms this has been described as 'policy-based evidence making.'<br /><br /> I would suggest that evidence for the causes and effects of worldwide obesity is easily enough for national and global action.  Few countries seem to be able to assess risk very effectively.  Call anything a threat to national security and all other rights can be trampled but problems such as obesity that carry the same or higher real risks are treated very differently and we have discussed some reasons for that.<br /><br /> Cynically, I guess you might say that the obesity epidemic is eventually going to be self-limiting because of its effects on mortality but the costs and misery on the way will be huge.  I might have to check the source but I've been told that there are now more overweight than underweight people in the world.  We therefore have the strange reality that, in a generation, the overriding problem of feeding the starving could be reversed.  Countering myths might be one place to start.  The problem is no longer one of producing enough food to feed the starving, it's one of redistribution.

541	123	1	"Continuing the smoking issue I don't think many people are aware of just how long the link between smoking and ill health has been known and that campaigns to discourage smoking were in place long before the 1950s when the link between cancer and smoking was identified. Hitler hated tobacco smoking (despite once being a heavy smoker) and he banned smoking on trams, inside government buildings and whilst Wehrmacht soldiers were on duty. Whilst not linking smoking to cancer he once lamented that many good men have been lost to tobacco smoking. He also promised to end tobacco smoking in the military after the war.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The term passive smoking (Passivrauchen) was coined in Nazi Germany. Hitler personally gave financial support to the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren (Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research) at the University of Jena, headed by Karl Astel.Established in 1941, it was the most significant anti-tobacco institute in Nazi Germany.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Franz H. Müller in 1939 and E. Schairer in 1943 first used case-control epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers. In 1939, Müller published a study report in a reputed cancer journal in Germany which claimed that prevalence of lung cancer was higher among smokers.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Restrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products,enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression of masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Apart from public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology; specifically, the movement was influenced by concepts of racial hygiene and bodily purity. Nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for the master race to smoke and that tobacco consumption was equal to ""racial degeneracy"". The Nazis viewed tobacco as a ""genetic poison"". Racial hygienists opposed tobacco use, fearing that it would ""corrupt"" the ""German germ plasm"". Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a vice of the degenerates.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The Nazis claimed that the Jews were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects. The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews. Johann von Leers, editor of the Nordische Welt (Nordic World), during the opening ceremony of the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren in 1941, proclaimed that ""Jewish capitalism"" was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across Europe. He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in Amsterdam, the principal European entry point of Nicotiana. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Here we are 70 years later still trying to discourage smoking. Whilst the Nazi regime was evil it is interesting to note their awareness of smoking being unhealthy, perhaps not linking it to cancer but using advertising to discourage smoking. However, after the war rates of smoking rose dramatically.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> References<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Borio, Gene (1993–2003), Tobacco Timeline: The Twentieth Century 1900-1949--The Rise of the Cigarette.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Robert N.

""If a patient's blood sugar level is not well-controlled with their current treatment, other diabetes medicines may be required.""<br /><br />    Combination products containing the two agents are also affected, including saxagliptin and metformin extended release (Kombiglyze XR, AstraZeneca ), alogliptin and metformin (Kazano, Takeda), and alogliptin and pioglitazone (Oseni, Takeda).<br /><br />    The move follows an FDA internal safety review of two large cardiovascular-outcomes trials of patients with cardiovascular disease and a recommendation for the label revision by the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee during an April 2015 hearing.<br /><br />    At that meeting, the panel expressed greater concern about heart failure for saxagliptin than for alogliptin, but because the mechanism is not clear and the two belong to the same class, the majority opted to recommend the warning on both labels.<br /><br />    However, in the interim, a third large cardiovascular-outcomes trial with another DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin (Januvia, Merck), the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS), showed no signal of heart failure at all in type 2 diabetes patients who received the drug.<br /><br />SAVOR and EXAMINE, Compared With TECOS<br /><br />    Results of the two studies that prompted the FDA safety review — Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 (SAVOR-TIMI 53) and Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) — were first presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) meeting in 2013 and later published in the New England Journal of Medicine.<br /><br />    In the saxagliptin trial, which included 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease, there was no overall risk for cardiovascular events, but there was a 27% increase (3.5% vs 2.8%) in the rate of the first event of hospitalization for heart failure and a potential increased risk for all-cause mortality. Risk factors included a history of heart failure or kidney impairment.<br /><br />    In EXAMINE, which included a total of 5380 patients, 3.9% of patients receiving drug were hospitalized for heart failure vs 3.3% of patients receiving placebo. Although the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.19), heart failure was not an end point of the study.<br /><br />    The TECOS results with sitagliptin, the DPP-4 inhibitor that has been on the market for longest, were first presented at the ADA meeting last year and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine; the absence of any heart-failure signal was confirmed with a deeper dive into the results presented  at the ESC meeting in September 2015.<br /><br />All Best,<br /><br />Joey"	Joey Rio	2016-04-06 23:15:00	0	0

Host factors and high intake of gluten are both likely to be relevant , not to mention co-factors such as varying degrees of lactose intolerance. Gut doctors have been to blame for much of the normal/abnormal approach with an obsession with what is seen on biopsy , but better antibody screening - and this work on zonulin - may make some of them change their mind.<br /><br /> My impressionis is that food interests of this type are more likely to involve certain socio-economic groups for a variety of reasons but perhaps the USA is ahead of us in this. I am occasionally a bit shocked to see just how ignorant and unaware are some folk where one might have expected better understanding. In the UK we lag behind both the USA and Europe with few signs of improvement so far although it seems that our politicians may just be beginning to catch up on trans fats and possibly sugar. One would very much like to see some of the so called chefs in the UK giving a bit of information on the nutrition in their recommended meals which sometimes seem much more iniquitous than a MacDonalds , but I think add to UK complacency amongst the chattering classes.<br /><br /> Of course the big problem in diet is not in the intolerances but in the vast amounts folk take in compared with a decreasing energy expenditure...."	sken	2016-01-14 17:39:00	0	0

558	129	1	On the 12th of November new guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease were published. [2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. J Am Coll Cardiol 12 Nov 2013] They were the result of four years of deliberation by a joint panel of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.  The changes have been summarized in the BMJ [BMJ 2013;347:f6858].  Highlights of the guidelines can be summarized as follows:<br /><br /><br />  The new risk assessment guideline uses a formula that is based on information easily collected in a primary care setting, such as age, cholesterol concentrations, blood pressure, smoking history, and diagnosis of diabetes. This information can then be entered into equations given in the guideline to create a risk score to guide patient counseling and, if warranted, treatment.<br /><br />  The risk factors used in the formula were age, smoking, high cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes.  Unlike previous guidelines, which were based on data only from non-Hispanic white people, the new guidelines include equations that better represent the effect of risk factors for women and African Americans.<br /><br />  The panel also found that four markers may be helpful for patients in whom the need for treatment remained uncertain after evaluation by the guideline’s risk equations: coronary artery calcium scores, C reactive protein concentrations, ankle brachial indices, and family history of premature cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />  The guideline on managing blood cholesterol identifies four major groups of people for whom moderate to high intensity treatment with statins is recommended: people who have known cardiovascular disease; those with a low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher; those aged 40-75 who have type 2 diabetes; and those aged 40-75 whose 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as estimated from the risk formulas provided in the report, is 7.5% or more.<br /><br />  The guideline on managing blood cholesterol identifies four major groups of people for whom moderate to high intensity treatment with statins is recommended: people who have known cardiovascular disease; those with a low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher; those aged 40-75 who have type 2 diabetes; and those aged 40-75 whose 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as estimated from the risk formulas provided in the report, is 7.5% or more.  High intensity statin treatment would include regimens that in the clinical trials reviewed by the panel reduced LDL cholesterol concentrations on average by around 50% or more. Atorvastatin 40-80 mg a day would be one example of a high intensity regimen.  Moderate intensity statin treatment would be regimens that lowered LDL cholesterol on average by around 30% to less than 50%. An example would be simvastatin 20-40 mg a day. The panel considered other cholesterol lowering drugs but found them to be not as effective as statins, said Neil J Stone, professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and chairman of the expert panel. “Statins were chosen because their use has resulted in the greatest benefit and the lowest rates of safety issues,” he said in a statement. Other drugs could be considered for patients who were intolerant of statins, he added.<br /><br />  The major and most controversial shift from current practice, the guideline does not recommend using combination therapy to try to reach specific LDL or non-HDL cholesterol concentration targets. Randomized controlled trials reviewed by the panel either compared fixed doses of statins with placebo or with untested controls or compared fixed doses of higher and lower intensity statins and were not designed to evaluate the effect of dose adjusted statin treatment to achieve pre-specified LDL or non-HDL cholesterol concentration targets.<br /><br /><br /> COMMENTS:  These new guidelines are already generating a great deal of interest and controversy.  They were the subject of two above the fold articles in the New York Times.  I am very interested in your comments on them.  I would especially be interested in two questions:<br /><br /> For all, what changes in your approach and monitoring of statin treatment will result from these new guidelines?<br /><br /> For those physicians on statins, what changes, if any, will these result in your self-treatment?	diabetesMD	2013-11-15 18:58:00	1	0

560	129	1	This is getting complicated.  According to an article to be published in Lancet and reviewed in the New York times yesterday, the risk estimator is based on old studies and may overestimate risk based on three new studies by as much as 100%. Based on that table virtually all black males over sixty-five should be on statins.  The NHBLI, which first generated the guidelines, were told about this when they circulated a draft for comment at least a year ago.  Their response was to withdrawal sponsorship by stating that it was not their responsibility to issue guidelines and turned over the responsibility to ACC and AHA, whio then issued the guidelines based on the same caculator.  It is not clear at this point what happens next, but this situation certainly undermines the scientic basis for the risk calculator and by implication the decisions based upon it as to whether to treat a given individual.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/health/risk-calculator-for-cholesterol-appears-flawed.html?pagewanted=all	diabetesMD	2013-11-19 17:58:00	0	0
561	129	1	Hey, be fair... this is a brilliant business model. Think about those poor pharma companies that have to try and prop up profits lost through the move to generics.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Who wrote these guidelines? Who funded them? Answer those two questions and you're someway toward understanding that this has nothing to do with clinical medicine; it has everything to do with commerce.	RonL	2013-11-19 19:35:00	0	0
562	129	1	In all cander that is a pretty cynical view and is not consistent with what is being reported.  First, the initiial guideline draft including the risk caculator was developed by the NHLBi, hardly a apologist for industry.  Second, the final guidelines were jointly issued by two  prestigious professional associations, the American Heart Association and the American college of Cardiology.  Third, the controversy is not about the value of the new guidelines.  Dr. Paul M. Ridker and Nancy R. Cook, Sc.D., of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in their commentary published online in Lancet yesterday. stated quite clearly that they thought that the guidelines were an improvement.  So what is the controversity?  The risk calculator is based on studies that began 20 years ago.  Three more recent studies, the Women’s Health Study, the Physicians’ Health Study, and the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study, all show lower risks than the older studies.  in Drs. Ridker and Cook's view the more recent data should have been used.  In the view of the guideline committee they older studies should be used.  Time will tell, but in either case the reason why they are called guidelines is because they are designed to guide, not dictate.	diabetesMD	2013-11-20 21:06:00	0	0
563	129	1	Thanks Charles. These guidelines seem to reflect the evidence better. I am not familiar with the risk score used but that is something that needs to be adapted for each population I would suppose. The guidelines are moving still more towards individualising therapy.<br /><br /> Limiting the use in the older person is to be welcomed as the risk of harm from the medication (especially the common adverse effects of statins) is perhaps greater than the benefits that may come but only after nearly 10 years of use. I suppose immediately post-MI is excluded from this?<br /><br /> In people with diabetes we may still be using combination therapy but there is certainly no evidence for its routing use.

564	129	1	The evidence base is known to be powerful for simvastatin, at reducing vascular events. Some drugs do reduce LDL values but with no evidence of effectiveness on reduced vascular events, and are expensive. This part of the guidance is sensible therefore<br /><br /> The emphasis on familiy history is very important.<br /><br /> What seems odd is the use of 7.5% as a cut point. Is it really worth treating everyone with a risk of 8% with a statin? Walnuts, Olive oil, and gentle walking would be better.	Felix	2013-11-21 16:41:00	0	0
565	129	1	Nice op-ed article in the New York Times yesterday http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/opinion/statins-by-numbers.html?_r=0 The author states that the use of evidence based guidelines is superior to the former use of numbers that seem reassuring to both doctor and patient, but are not backed up my any evidence.  He goes on to states that it should be up to the physicians and their patients to determine which cohort best describes the individual in making the decision as to initial treatment.	diabetesMD	2013-11-30 18:24:00	0	0
566	129	1	Also an editorila in our own BMJ echoes this opinion.  below is the concluding paragraph.<br /><br />Editorial<br /><br />Target cardiovascular risk rather than cholesterol concentration<br /><br />BMJ 2013; 347 doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f7110 (Published 27 November 2013) <br /><br />Cite this as: BMJ 2013;347:f7110 <br /><br /> In the end, the new guidelines are worthy of admiration. It is remarkable that an expert writing group, steeped in the dogma of cholesterol treatment targets, could dispassionately evaluate the evidence and reach a conclusion that was such a brave and wise departure from current practice. We still need to resolve how best to calculate risk and in which populations. We also need to move past the idea that patients and doctors should defer to thresholds for treatment and develop tools that will facilitate shared decisions about prevention strategies. Nevertheless, the advances in this guideline should be acknowledged. It will probably take some time before these new concepts can be fully understood and incorporated into practice. But at least in the United States the approach to preventing atherosclerotic heart disease and stroke is on a more evidence based course. Patients will be the beneficiaries when we translate these concepts into proper new practices.	diabetesMD	2013-11-30 18:36:00	0	0
567	129	1	In Response to Re: New Cardiovascular guidelines markedly depart from current thinking on LDL-cholesterol outcomes:<br /><br /> Hey, be fair... this is a brilliant business model. Think about those poor pharma companies that have to try and prop up profits lost through the move to generics.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Who wrote these guidelines? Who funded them? Answer those two questions and you're someway toward understanding that this has nothing to do with clinical medicine; it has everything to do with commerce.<br /><br /><br /> Posted by RonL<br /><br /> I would have to agree. The new guidelines extend the number of patients even further to get a larger proportion of the population onto statins.However, this is probably not a case driven by the improved profit to be extracted from off-patent drugs [which menas that as the price is lower more have to be sold to make the same income]. The new guidelines are driven by true believers of the faith of low cholesterol.<br /><br /> There is also a problem because the risk score used has been shown not to be well-calibrated against reality: i.e. it predicts an event rate twice as high as actually occurs in the population.<br /><br /> To be fair there is a lot of evidence that the lower LDL goes the better. From the JUPITER trial we know that if cholesterol is < 1.3 mmol/L (50mg/L), the outcome was better than in teh patients with LDL higher than that cut off. Newer agents are working towards LDL  at about 0.5 mmol/L.<br /><br /> The real question is whether this will provide useful benefit. At current cut offs NNT to prevent an event is quite large. To go down to even lower cholesterol will make it ridiculoiusly high.<br /><br /> Personally, I think Risk fatigue sets in: We all have to die of something anf if we remove all other risks, it is likely to be something unpleasant that gets us in the end [famine and over-population].

581	131	1	Pinetree<br /><br /> The debate on antibiotic use and resistance often ignores the very real difficulties, as you imply, of deciding between bacterial and viral infections in individual patients.   <br /><br /> Your first question was whether it was sensible to check the white cell count and/or ESR (CRP is as good and cheaper in these circumstances).  It's only worth doing any of these tests if decisions about management depend on the results and I'm not sure they do in this particular example.  Certainly the white count and CRP can be elevated in bacterial upper respiratory infections as well as in pneumonia.  Even if not raised in viral infections it's so common for bacterial infection to follow in these circumstances that to test once could be unhelpful.  Perhaps someone could tell us for sure but is green/yellow sputum really a common feature in pneumonia? Physical signs including localised crepitations or other features of consolidation can help but radiography is probably underused.  The decision about antibiotic use presumably hinges more on the whole picture than on a blood test alone.  I can't see that there could be any real criticism of a doctor who considered prescribing an antibiotic for the example you describe.<br /><br /> You seem to want to avoid culture of the sputum but couldn't that be the most logical test to guide treatment in a patient who has more than a trivial illness, particularly if they are in any of the categories where the organisms might be less usual ones?<br /><br /> 'Probably viral' can be used indiscriminately when there's pressure not to use antibiotics; vague terms such as 'viral pleurisy' can be frankly misleading as well as preventing diagnosis of much more likely and important causes.

I'll post the answer in a few days.<br /><br /> A 14 year old girl presented to her local hospital with a three week history of progressively worsening cough, fever, and poor appetite, which had not responded to a week of oral antibiotics.<br /><br /> On examination she had a temperature of 38°C, was pale, not clubbed, and her oxygen saturations were 95% in air. There was a dull note on percussion, with reduced air entry on auscultation in the right upper zone of the chest, and no added sounds. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.<br /><br /> At admission, blood tests showed haemoglobin 109 g/L (reference range 105-135), white blood cell count 12.7×106 cells/L (6.0-18), neutrophils 7.65×106 cells/L (2.0-6.0), C reactive protein 33 mg/L (0-5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 116 mm in the first hour (10).

595	134	1	Are you waiting patiently for the new NICE asthma guideline?  You'll be waiting a bit longer, after NICE decided today to delay the release of the guideline while they assess the impact it will have on routine clinical practice.  <br /><br />The draft guideline from January took the controversial direction of removing the trial of treatment option from previous BTS/SIGN versions of the guidelines, instead encouraging GPs to carry out tests of airway hyper-responsiveness, such as FeNO and Mannitol challenge, in primary care.<br /><br /> GP bodies have responded with their concerns over monetary and time costs, as well as the requirement for re-training in technical and interpretative skills required to carry out these tests in primary care.<br /><br /> We got rid of oral steroid trials many years ago (everyone feels better on 2 weeks of steroids), but the trial of inhaled therapy was often very helpful, I found.  Perhaps the reasoning was to minimise the number of patients who get left on ICS long term, without actually having asthma, but adherence rates being as they are, it seems unlikely to be a major issue in the real world.<br /><br /> We continue to wait for the guidelines.   But I'd rather see a new COPD guideline first.

600	136	1	"This paper is interesting.  We've thought for a long time that emphysema on a CT scan is a bad thing - but more recent evidence from meta-analyses suggested that CT emphysema doesn't respond the same way as microscopic emphysema.  Perhaps we should have known that - case series have shown that large bullae caused by cannabis smoking can be asymptomatic.  This study suggests that the incidental finding of CT emphysema does make a big difference to COPD outcomes in the future.<br /><br /><br /> Airway thickening has a large affect on future outcomes in this study, a hazard ratio of  />5 is impressive.  But there's no link with fullly fledged bronchiectasis.  This is odd.  Bronchiectasis patients do more badly than simple COPD, if they're colonised with bacteria, particularly pseudomonas or staph.  But, we know that there's a diffierence betwee the radiological finding of bronchiectasis, and the clinical syndrome of bronchiectasis - patients with traction bronchiectasis, for example, don't behave in teh same manner as patients with chronic bronchial sepsis and bronchiectatic change on a CT.  So perhaps here the patients with ""bronchiectasis"" have only the radiological changes, not the clinical syndrome.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> We're often criticised, as a speciality, for requesting too many scans.  But when we scan patients, we find things, and this study shows that these findings are useful for prognostication."

Fairchild, MD, MPH, and Lorenzo Di Francesco, MD, FACP, FHM<br /><br />Use of intravenous corticosteroids might lead to better outcomes among patients hospitalized with severe community-acquired pneumonia and high inflammatory responses, a JAMA study suggests.<br /><br />Some 120 adults with severe pneumonia and C-reactive protein levels above 150 mg/L at admission were randomized to receive IV methylprednisolone (0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours) or placebo for 5 days, beginning within 36 hours of admission. All patients also received antibiotics.<br /><br />The primary outcome — a composite of treatment failure endpoints — occurred less often with steroids versus placebo (13% vs. 31% of patients). This difference was due to a reduction in radiographic progression at 3–5 days with methylprednisolone. In-hospital mortality did not differ between the groups.<br /><br />The authors write, ""If replicated, these findings would support the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive treatment in this clinical population.""

612	140	1	My apologies, Joey, for my very late response!     My excuse is that D2D used to send me an email copy of a personal message, but didn't this time (and may not at others), and I forget to look at my PMs.     I've raised the first with the D2D admin and the second with the 'attention cells' in my thalamus.<br /><br /> New readers, start here:  Etomidate is an intravenous anaesthetic agent that is particularly free of haemodynamic side-effects.    It was used in an infusion to provide sedation for ventilated ICU patients, until their relatively poor survival was noticed, and the drug's effect of completely inhibiting the steroid  response to stress was discovered.   But this was thought to be a function of the duration of the infuson, and it was still used for induction of anaesthesia, especially in unstable patients.<br /><br /> More recently http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10460557?dopt=Abstract&holding=f1000,f1000m,isrctn  it was found that a single dose inhibited the adrenals for up to 24 hours.   As we now have suitable alternatives, such as ketamine and propofol, etomidate has fallen out of use in critical care.   Strangely there are still people using it as if this had never been known before http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22967694<br /><br /> This review article from 2012  http://ccforum.com/content/16/4/227 deals fully with the question as a debate.    It finds that the actual effect on survival or recovery of a single etomidate dose, for induction, has never been  trialled, so that the drug may be avoided unfairly.  But in the prescence of acceptable alternatives, I think it would be difficult to get such a trial past an ethical committee!  Certainl;y I haven't used it for a very long time.<br /><br /> JOhn	John D	2015-03-19 14:54:00	0	0

In 1903 at the University of Lyons, Alexis Carrel was ridiculed because he mentioned that a Tuberculosis patient he attended, had been cured by prayer. The response of the Dean of Faculty was so cold that he had no choice except to leave the Faculty. Eventually he joined the Rockefeller Institute.

Am J Emerg Med 2015 May.<br /><br />With CT as the gold standard, bedside ultrasound was more sensitive than x-ray for pneumonia in ED patients.<br /><br />Lung ultrasound can detect pneumothorax and pulmonary edema, but limited data exist to quantify its accuracy for diagnosing pneumonia. In a prospective study, investigators compared lung ultrasound to chest computed tomography (CT) and chest x-ray among adult patients presenting with unexplained respiratory symptoms to an academic emergency department in Italy.CT served as the gold standard for diagnosis of an infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Patients were enrolled when a CT scan was planned. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed within 3 hours of the CT scan by either emergency physicians or internists, and chest x-ray was performed at the discretion of the treating physician.During the 8-month study period, 285 patients underwent CT and ultrasound, and, of these, 190 also had a chest x-ray. Chest CT was positive for pneumonia in 87 patients. Sensitivity for diagnosing pneumonia was significantly higher with ultrasound than x-ray (81% vs. 64%), while specificities were statistically similar (94% and 90%)	Mukhtar Ali	2015-05-15 18:47:00	0	0
625	142	1	This is very interesting.<br /><br /> I've done hundreds of thoracic ultrasound examinations, and frequently pick up consolidated lung behind effusions, and also in isolation.  One thing I did wonder about, though, was how good USS is at differentiating consilidation from atelectasis.<br /><br /> It's no surprise that CXR isn't very sensitive for pneumonia, in comparison to CT, though.  The CXR is only good for looking at the parts of the lung that the CXR can show - pneumonia often missed behing the heard, beind both diaphragms, and in the apices.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Also, I think the first line must be a typo - I'm sure they mean pleural effusion, rather than pulmonary eodema, right?

Lung function improved in those treated with the combination drug compared with patients given tiotropium or olodaterol alone.<br /><br />The spray shouldn't replace treatment with a rescue inhaler.

651	146	1	Whilst I share the view that people want and deserve 'rights', it always proves rather easier to talk about rights than to ensure they are observed.  Even the four freedoms trumpeted by the allies after WW2 have been fragile in the very countries that claim to protect them.<br /><br /> One of the problems is that one person's rights or demands often conflict with someone else's.  When that someone else is a government, even one considered democratic, the government tends to overrule many rights on the basis of economics, national security or some other caveat that has rarely been considered or admitted when the rights were originally 'enshrined'.<br /><br /> I suspect that the right to fertility similarly falls foul of exclusion causes.  When rights have been broken it is never easy to get redress because the policing is rarely as robust as the concept.  Even where states have ridden rough-shod over human rights in the most murderous ways it tends to be decades before anyone is made to pay.<br /><br /> In summary, rights are necessary and a comforting thought but let's not fool ourselves that they are always worth the paper on which they are written, particularly,as Sam Goldwyn said, when the paper on which they are written is a verbal agreement. <br /><br /> Maxim the cynic.

The question most often posed in this field is, 'is there a right to a baby', or to infertility treatment, or to successful infertility treatment?  The obvious answer is no, because all rights have a correlative duty, and there is no duty on any person or on the health service or on researchers to ensure that someone else has a baby.  Even between married persons, there is no duty to cooperate in fertility. The marital rape exemption has been abolished, and in general the father or husband has no say in whether the mother of his child has an abortion or not.  A wife cannot demand fertile intercourse; parenthood is, or should be, a matter of agreement, negotiation or at least tolerance.  We know from our study of infertility treatment, there is no assurance that any one of us can ever be guaranteed by medicine a baby of our own.  Is there then a right to enable everyone to access all available fertility treatment in any circumstances?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> After the introduction of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law by the 1998 Act, everything is different.  Broadly speaking, it elevates the rights and aspirations of the individual over legislation that was originally designed to suit largely only the public and the executive good.  It permeates our written and unwritten law; it tips the scales of justice even where an older British statute had already attempted, through nuanced drafting, to balance the rights of the individual versus society.  And so in the field of infertility, where the interface between individual desires and public health and ethics is particularly intimate, it has a substantial impact on the application of the infertility laws, and one that is not always expected. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Article 8 of the Human Rights convention grants the right to respect for private and family life. Article  12 grants the right to marry and found a family within national law. Article 14 declares that there should be no discrimination on any ground in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention.  We should remember the historical background against which these rights were drafted (as John and others note).  They were drafted in the aftermath of the Second World War and express, inter alia, the distaste for enforced sterilisation measures and prohibition of marriage between classes of persons that were features of the war and other systems of conflict and dictatorship since then.  My view is that Article 12 really means that society as a whole should not prevent individuals from procreating within the legal structure of that country.  This does not help us to interpret the complicated issues that can arise in relation to fertility treatment today, most of which would have been beyond the ken of the drafters.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In a civilised society there is no right to procreate at will.  A regulatory system like ours maintains the basics of reproductive autonomy, for example, the right to consent and to refuse, the right to avoid reproduction as well as access to the technology as democratically distributed, and abortion.  There is no free for all in the societies that we consider advanced. They regulate, for example, the age of marriage and consent to intercourse, abortion and incest.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Logically there can be no right to infertility treatment.  It is too artificial a procedure to be in any way counted as a natural right or one essential to life, any more than one can have a right to good health and all possible treatment at any cost within a national health service.  No patient can ever be guaranteed successful medical treatment because nature has the last word still: we can only contemplate a promise of access as determined in a democratic society without unlimited medical resources. Where the facilitating of pregnancy has to include third parties beyond the confines of husband and wife (hardly private), then accountability and medical ethics must contribute to the decision, because it has a knock-on effect for all treatments of the infertile and others.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In general, to press for a 'right' must mean that existence without that right is a blighted and uncomfortable existence.  In a society where many choose to remain childless and where availability of contraception and abortion was counted in the 1960s as one of women's triumphs and, indeed, human rights, it is impossible to argue that life without a baby is a condition for which there must be a remedy at all costs.  One of the difficult aspects of the HFEA was to put across the message and create the policies whereby, at one and the same time, potential patients secured reasonable access to infertility treatment (a battle with the NHS has yet to be seriously fought), while protecting childless women from the image of themselves as defective vessels needing expensive medicine to make them whole.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> One particular area that has caused great concern in the UK and around the world is the rights of prisoners to have access to IVF/AI:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The cases on prisoners' rights illustrate the dilemmas posed by human rights to fertility, albeit not decided under the HFE legislation.   In 1995 Dickson was convicted of murder for kicking a drunken man to death, and sentenced to life imprisonment.  While serving his sentence, he began a penpal relationship with Lorraine, who was serving time for benefit fraud and already had 3 children.  They were married after her release (note that British law does not generally prevent marriage of prisoners - but does block their procreational activities). Dickson was due for release in 2009, by which time Lorraine would be over 50 and unable to conceive naturally (the court was told).  The couple's application for AI was rejected; they complained to the High Court and Court of Appeal that their rights to family and private life, to marry and found a family were being denied, but they lost.  The ECHR gave judgment in 2004 (Dickson v UK, ECHR 18/4/06 App.44362/04)). The European judges were clear in denying the right of a prisoner and his wife to reproductive technologies for childbearing while he was incarcerated.  The argument that society allows children to be born to single parents in poor circumstances was not regarded as sufficient to entitle the prisoner to achieve something similar.  This was because the state was being asked to become an active accomplice and participant in the conception.  'I believe a responsible state to be right to require of itself standards higher than those beyond its control in the free procreation market', said Judge Bonello. The court paid attention to the fact that the couple had not yet experienced normal living together and that the circumstances in which the child might be born would not be good.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> To general surprise, the Grand Chamber of the European Court, consisting of 17 judges, allowed the appeal by the Dickson (albeit that by 2007 he had been moved to an open prison, was allowed home visits and Lorraine was 49) and awarded them damages for deprivation of their human rights. The Court held that Art. 8, the right to private and family life, was engaged and included respect for the decision to become parents.  Prisoners retained their human rights on imprisonment and any restriction of them must be justified in each case, and not dismissed because in general they would offend public opinion.  The competing interests of the state and the parties had not been properly weighed by the British authorities, said the Court, nor had the issue of proportionality of interference with the prisoners' rights, so a blanket refusal of AI amounted to a breach of Art. 8.  Little attention seemed to be paid to the article of English law that was so important in the court below, and that dominates our family law, namely that the welfare of the child is paramount in decisions. The decision is odd in that it is in an area where the European Court normally respects the diverse practices and discretion of individual nations within Europe. The European Court did not invent a right to procreate; nor did it insist that conjugal visits be granted, or that reproductive facilities be granted to all citizens; it focused instead on the quality of the balancing of considerations within the policy of our government in refusing AI to prisoners.  Nevertheless, the decision, inconsistent though it is, and based on a procedural argument, may be interpreted by lawyers in future cases as having originated a right to reproduce within the list of human rights.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Contrast this with the Israeli action in the case of Yigal Amir, the assassin of Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, in 1995, a killing undertaken in order to derail the then peace process.  Under Israeli law prisoners are allowed to marry and have children, but in his case, because of the nature of the crime, the right to marry had been refused.  Nevertheless he married, by proxy, Larissa Trimbobler, a 42 year old divorced mother of four, who shared his political views. After more than two years of petitioning for the right to consummate their marriage, she was allowed a conjugal visit in late 2006; the courts had held that prisoners have these human rights. She gave birth to a boy in 2007. Israel is a very pro-natalist country, but these actions caused some public dismay, because they amounted to nationalistic defiance as well as human rights for prisoners.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The leading case in the US is Gerber v Hickman (2002), where after some vacillation court by courts, Gerber was finally denied the right to AI for his wife.  He was serving a sentence in California of 100 years for murder and his wife was 41. The court held that there was no constitutional right to procreate while in prison.  Conjugal visits too were denied to lifers because there was no expectation that they would ever be reunited with their families.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Two Spanish prisoners have reportedly received IVF treatment while in prison. Fernando Garcia Jodra, 40, and his girlfriend Nerea Bengoa Zarisolo, 39, were convicted of terrorist activities associated with the Basque separatist organisation ETA in 2004. They were being held in separate prisons and denied physical contact with each other. The couple applied for fertility treatment under Spanish law, which permits women wide access to reproductive technologies. Mr Jodra, one of the gunmen convicted for the murder of former Spanish government minister Professor Ernest Lluch, was transferred to a different prison to undergo fertility treatment. The couple are reportedly being treated at the Reina Sofia Hospital in Corboda, southern Spain. The president of the Victims of Terrorism Association, Mr Angeles Pedraza, expressed anger at the news saying the treatment was 'a kick in the face for the victims'. The Spanish press report that, if the treatment is successful, the couple's child will remain with Ms Zarisolo in custody until three years old. This is not the first time Spanish prisoners have applied for fertility treatment. In 2008, a Spanish woman, Ms Elena Beloki was reportedly granted permission to access IVF while serving a 13-year prison sentence for her involvement with ETA.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The Australian Supreme Court allowed a woman in prison for fraud to continue with self-funded fertility treatment. Ms Kimberley Castles had begun IVF treatment at a clinic in Melbourne prior to her imprisonment.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> In the UK the Justice Secretary launched a campaign in 2013 to stop prisoners being allowed to AI/IVF. Mr Grayling’s pledge indicates that he is prepared to take on the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which has previously ruled that blocking access to such treatment may breach inmates’ right to a “private and family life”. The minister has said in the past that such cases starkly illustrate the need for a change to the “human rights framework”. Recently he told a newspaper that he has ordered a review into the policy on prisoners having access to artificial insemination “with a view to banning it”. In December, it emerged that five life prisoners - four murderers and a convicted drug dealer – had asked to be allowed NHS fertility treatment so that they could father a child from behind bars. However it is feared that his proposed ban on inmates receiving fertility treatment will end up back in the courts and could see inmates who are refused treatment winning compensation.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Time will tell.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> All the above reflect my own personal understanding and appreciation of relevant law and ethics. I raise these points for the purposes of discussion which (by reading others views and responses) helps me determine my own perspectives.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> .	kirked	2014-08-09 06:16:00	0	0

656	146	1	"I agree.  It's rather easy to talk about rights but, given that disputes are often settled in courts it's good for clinicians to appreciate how these things are dissected forensically.  Although it's not surprising, it's still unsettling to be reminded that, like clinicians, different courts come to different judgements, some of which can seem perverse.<br /><br /> Dr S mentioned something in an early post that intrigued me:<br /><br />  ""Sometimes there are medical or even evolutionary reasons behind infertility. Should the courts be granting rights that counter evolution?""<br /><br /> I couldn't immediately think of reasons that might 'counter evolution' but I wondered if this meant genetic disorders that would diminish in the population if not transmitted and that this ran counter to the popular view of evolution as 'survival of the fittest'.  I think a more current concept of genetics might refer more to adaptability in the face of adverse environments but perhaps Dr S could explain.  It's interesting that the legal approaches seem to be more pragmatic and not to defer to biological concepts or belief systems."

657	146	1	A new concern has arisen in this debate. A Liverpool NHS Hospital has announced that it is opening Infertility treatment centres in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Amnesty International has expressed deep concern about the practical aspects of this service in countries that regard women as second class citizens. Male family members make decisions and want male babies.<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Will women essentially have to follow the orders of a man and have no choice in any regard to treatment. Will they be vessels required to carry male children? According to Amnesty International research, women in Saudi Arabia regularly require the permission of a male “guardian” to seek medical care including fertility treatments. Adam Coogle, a Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “There is a complex web of rules that means women are treated as minors by male guardians for the entire life.<br /><br />   <br /><br />  The hospital is opening these centres because the management envisage large profits which they will use within the trust.<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Will the NHS be in collusion with discriminatory practices?<br /><br />   <br /><br />  kirked<br /><br />   <br /><br />   <br /><br />   <br /><br />   <br /><br />   <br /><br />   <br /><br />  .	kirked	2014-09-08 05:33:00	0	0

660	147	1	Leaving aside other disputes about personal ethics and responsibilities of sperm (or egg donation), I wonder if such sperm bank exclusions are really that different, in principle, from the choices and exclusions that have been made for centuries by men and women looking for mothers and fathers to their hoped-for children.<br /><br /> Personally I find many eugenics ideas distasteful but there are sections of society (no names no pack drill) here and abroad that routinely do background searches on the pedigree, health and other attributes of prospective partners.  Experience shows that such searching, matching and exclusion often doesn't guarantee 'success' but the right to make such choices doesn't seem to be much questioned even if we find it amusing.<br /><br /> I guess that the vast majority of people rely largely on pot luck for their choices and this might well be the best plan but the criteria for exclusion are obviously on a spectrum.  At one end we have the problem of lethal and other desperate diseases whose inheritance and predictability are beyond much doubt. At the other end we have characteristics and behaviours that are much less certain in their inheritance and expression. <br /><br /> I'm prepared to bet that we would never have had many of the people who changed the world for the better if their parents had relied on family history before breeding.

661	147	1	"Maxim - not sure how you chose your partner (or vice versa) , but it seems to me that some degree of ""eugenics"" , consciously or subconsciously comes into play. The decision to screen for major genetic diseases also seems appropriate in some rare instances for the sake of the offspring. ""Pot luck"" suggests not even considrering a whole range of factors contributing to compatibility. Perhaps one of the reasons for the UK's high divorce rate.<br /><br /> Consumer choice has all sorts of manifestations. Sperm banks need to be open about their selection process for donors - just how selective may vary with demand , supply and competition. What is the obligatin to the donor if the sperm is screened and significant disease potential found ? presumably some screening takes place already. Just how rules are developed in this new world is not always clear in this age of sperm and egg donation. Currently I doubt whether the rules used will make a significant difference to the overall human gene pool and perhaps we should just watch how this market develops? <br /><br /> John D raises the point about responsibility - failure to check could be the Bank's , failure to declare that of the donor .... I suspect there is a lot of counselling involved."	sken	2015-12-30 17:17:00	0	0
662	147	1	Thanks Sken<br /><br /> I hasten to add that, by 'pot luck', I was referring specifically to the choice of a future co-parent for children.  I agree that the way we choose a partner for romantic and other reasons is determined, sometimes quite quickly, by a range of conscious and subconscious influences.  Personally, I doubt that I thought initially a great deal about the suitability of my wife as a child-bearer.  Others would undoubtedly differ in their choice.<br /><br /> This seems to be a key difference in having a choice of sperm (or egg) donor where the complexities of personal compatibility are irrelevant but genetic fitness is the only consideratio in the context you describe.

663	147	1	"Maxim - yes I think there is a complete range in spouse selection from those who give it little thought to those where it really is a major factor. It could be women are far more selective in this repect eg will spouse be able to provide for children comes into it as well.<br /><br /> Where one stands in this behavioural spectrum also influences one's ethical views and sympathies on subjects such as IVF on the NHS and our attitudes to sperm donation. There is also the problem of whether a spouse is prepared to take second place to offspring - fine if the children are central to the marriage but can be a problem if not? <br /><br /> Personally I have no problem with those who look a little into family educational or sporting background before leaping into matrimony but as with everything else it seems abnormal when it becomes a bit obsessive. At the other end I am quite happy with the idea of marrying for somewhat romantic reasons but raise my eyebrows at the wedding as an additional excuse for a party after a lustful meeting on a beach somewhere...<br /><br /> At the very least perhaps it is a good idea for the couple to have a broad idea about how they see the children issue before settling down together.<br /><br /> My own view is somewhat ""gestalt"" : the spouse is rather more than just a series of parts and it is the whole person that can crucial.<br /><br /> I wonder if we will ever be able to find alternatives to words such as eugenics and euthanasia - the only that comes to mind is ""common sense"" and ""middle road"" ."	sken	2015-12-31 17:30:00	0	0

665	149	1	"This morning (2/9/15) a joint statement from the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Association of Medical Research Charities and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council all issued a joint statement, saying that genome editing should be allowed, ""when justified"".  http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2015/WTP059712.htm<br /><br /> Their analysis of the success and accuracy of the CRISPR-Cas9 technique is that it offers the potential of curing conditions with a known genetic basis.  They say that this technology should be investigated and developed, but that work is inhibited by current law prohibiting embryos that have altered genes form surviving beyond 14 days.  They do not at present suggest that such embryos be allowed to survive longer or even to be implanted.   Instead, they have issued this statement to stimulate discussion among scientists, politicians and the public about genome editing, so that for once opinion can lead legislation.<br /><br /> The possibilities for genome editing are both clear and exciting. It would be possible to gene-edit cells from a patient without the apparently dangerous use of carrier viruses, and return them to their body to counteract the results of the remaining faulty genes, and even to attack cancer cells.    This could help people with a single genetic fault, such as cystic fibrosis or haemophilia, but of more concern would be using this on embryos.      If that embryo were allowed to be born, then the child would not be 'cured', they would never have the condition that their parents carried, and need have no fear of their children being carriers of the disease.   This altering of the gene line is at the same time of concern to many, if it causes changes that appear later down the generations.<br /><br /> The research bodies think it is time to discuss how, what and when such a technique should be used, so that in the future, the near future, the law may be changed to allow its use in circumstances that are acceptable to the majority.<br /><br /> Do you think that embryo gene editing should be allowed?<br /><br /> John"	John D	2015-09-02 09:47:00	0	0

He summarised the main arguments for and against eponyms in Medicine. <br /><br />BMJ 2014;349:g7586 doi: 10.1136/bmj.g7586 (Published 16 December 2014).<br /><br />My own answer would be definitely to keep them and this would apply even if, the person is later found to have done 'bad things'.  Reiter is an example where the eponym has recently been expunged from usage.  I would argue that we should always try to learn about the names enshrined in these eponyms and to be aware of and learn from bad things that were done.  We can't, or shouldn't, try to rewrite history. <br /><br />Anyone with any sense should realise that diseases, structures and processes first described decades or centuries ago may now have a very different profile which keeps changing and it's incumbent on all clinicians to keep up to date with current knowledge, at least in their own field.<br /><br />There's a danger that we come to think Medicine is only about now and is just a product of the most recent guideline, dictats or even financial statement.  This is probably not accidental but our current clinical practice arises from an unbroken lineage of  people, advances and lessons with an unbroken line extending back and, we hope, forwards. <br /><br />Appreciation of how we got here is rapidly being lost in medical education; many students and new doctors look blank when even names such as Osler is mentioned (while talking about 'coeliac's disease as if Dr Coeliac described it!).  It's clearly not necessary for a formal history of Medicine to be taught routinely but our most valued teachers and mentors extend well beyond those who are still alive.  The lessons from even those who are long deceased are often still valuable today.  Other sciences, the humanities and the law celebrate and learn from their histories and we should do the same.

677	153	1	F. Bruder Stapleton, MD reviewing Adelman J et al. Pediatrics 2015 Jul 13.<br /><br /><br /><br />Using a distinct temporary first name that incorporated the mother's first name reduced wrong-patient electronic orders by 36%.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Newborns must be given an immediate temporary first name, which most often is “Babyboy” or “Babygirl.” These nondistinct names can be a source of medical errors and misidentification.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In one center's NICU, interventionists created a distinct first name for newborns that incorporated the mother's first name. For example, in the case of a fictional mother named Wendy Jackson, a daughter would be temporarily named “Wendysgirl Jackson” rather than “Babygirl Jackson.” For multiple births, a number was added in front of the distinct name (e.g., “1Wendysgirl,” “2Wendysgirl”). To assess the effectiveness of this naming convention, researchers evaluated the incidence of wrong-patient errors during the 1-year period before and after the intervention. Errors were captured using an automated tool that probed the medical record for orders that were retracted and reordered (RAR).<br /><br />RAR events declined by 36% during the first year after implementing the intervention (odds ratio, 0.64). Use of the distinct first name was particularly beneficial in reducing RAR events in orders placed by house staff (OR, 0.48) and in orders concerning male infants (0.39).

687	157	1	I've noticed one colleague who tends to automatically copy the patient's accent in order to facilitate communication. When I had a discussion with the doctor he stated that he names it mirroring. He does it for two reasons. First, he imitates the accent to build rapport with the patient so as to have some familiarity. Second, he uses local terminology to make it easier for the patient to understand him.<br /><br /> I wonder whether you find this a necessary communication skill or a manifestation of pretention that may be perceived by the patient as derogatory sign or an expression of lack of authenticity	Sidhom	2015-02-23 19:31:00	0	0
688	157	1	I don't think you need to parrot accents to communicate. You could sound silly. Why can't the patient copy your accent? Are we superior?<br /><br /> On the other hand I try to use analogies germane to the patient's background to explain stuff. I also use vocabulary including slang appropriate to that person's in order to convey ideas. However I don't indulge in obscenities or vulgarity. <br /><br /> Your job is to deliver ideas, advise and treat and words are the colours on your pallet.

It could be seen as mocking some of those who have been brought up in other countries.

I also suspect adopting terms which are obviously alien to me is uncertain territory , certainly using them once an understanding has been reached would be acceptable. <br /><br /> Like John D , I have been exposed to much banter in the course of my life. most of my wider family are Northern folk whereas my childhood was one of Southern ""smoothness"" - along the lines of the Queen's English should be spoken as the Queen speaks it.....

695	157	1	I think from a British point of view it is regarded as offensive, however, from a British Indian point of view, imitating accents is key to improving communication.<br /><br /> Don't get me wrong, to observe it's awfully awkward, however what one needs to remember is that individuals who have learnt English in another country, or are visitors or new to the country, have learnt English with their home country's pronounciation. <br /><br /> As a person who lived in a European country for a number of years, it was much easier to communicate in english using that country's pronounciation of the alphabet.<br /><br /> Bringing back to the British Indian element, when communicating with family members coming over to visit, I cannot speak an Indian language, they speak English with a strong Indian accent. I can say a statememt or question 5 times in my standard english accent, with no effect, the second I repeat myself in a mirrored accent (note - not a humrous mocking accent, but simply mirroring their pronounciation), communication flows without problems.<br /><br /> Relating this to patient care, it saves time and allows for effective communication. If the person you're communicating to responds, then it's something that should be considered for normal practice. It is possible to be polite and inoffensive when mirroring accents.

699	159	1	The phrasing of your question asking for 'justification' suggests that you might have a personal stance and it would be interesting if you disclosed that.<br /><br /> To promote discussion I'd approach this via another question: who owns us?  Do we own ourselves or is it the State or something else such as a deity if you have a religious belief.  In many countries the answer is clearly the State, particularly in totalitarian regimes.  We hardly need to remind ourselves where that leads.<br /><br /> My own explanation would be that the 'discrepancy' that you describe reflects a lack of enlightenment amongst those who don't appreciate the nonsense of regarding suicide, or its attempt, as a crime.  That reflects progress in my view but others might disagree.<br /><br /> I could understand how someone with particular religious belief has a perfect right to decide there is an ethical dimension to suicide but that cannot be imposed on others who don't share those beliefs. That doesn't exclude anyone taking into account the likely effect of their suicide on family or friends.<br /><br /> Does that help kick off debate?

700	159	1	"Arousa's question seemed to be more to do with the attitude of the State to suicide than religious belief.   As the latter is always allied with politics, and while we fear neither here, the discussion needs to as civilsed as it almost always is on D2D.  Long may it do so!<br /><br /> My own view is that suicide is far most often associated with depression, which is or should be a temporary mental disturbance for which treatment is always availbale and usually successful.     I would not accuse our psychiatric colleagues of treatment failure, any more than a surgeon whose patient dies, but suicid as a symptom of deprssion si esenetially avoidable.<br /><br /> But then there are people so unfortunate as to have good reason for thinking that thier lives are not worth living.    The UK Gov has made it known that any person in this position who goes to Switzerland and Dignitas will not have their family or carers indicted for 'aiding and abetting"", but ciontinues to insist that it will not make any moves towards giving 'assisted suicide' similar status to that in several US States, were its use had increased since first allowed but still helps tiny numbers of people.  <br /><br />  I would welcome such a law, although I know my GP colleagues have worries, epscially as the load would fall on them.    Although so far I have no condition that might make me want to use an exit, I sincerely hope that it does appear in the next twenty years in the UK, becasue in that time I am likely to!<br /><br /> John"	John D	2015-01-14 22:36:00	0	0
701	159	1	"Suicide is too complex to be seen as a single entity. I would not see those killing themselves whilst deeply depressed as actinng ""unethically"", but rational suicide is a more interesting problem - and one in which there is a growing interest. Is the patient who refuses life prolonging treatment in the absence of significant depression acting unethically or simply making a balanced judgement ? There seems to be growing interest in the concept of a ""completed life"" : is there a time when individuals might see their lives as completed and be ready for death - increasingly relevant to some older folk but not limited to them?  <br /><br /> Our literature and culture also shows a respect for those who lay down life for the sake of others and one of the great religions has a suicide as a centrral theme. <br /><br /> I see each act of suicde as a separate event. I see somethinng unethical about it if done for frivolous or petulant reasons , tragic if part of a treatable depressive illness or readily correctable social factors , but see certain circumstances where it is an eminently rational decision. Survivors and those left behind need to be taken into account but because these may feel guilty or distressed is not necessarily a reason for the suicide not going ahead. Nor does it ,in itself, make the suicide unethical. <br /><br /> The original question also seems to cofuse legality and ethics : lots of things (abortion , homosexuality etc...) may be illegal at one time or place. That does not make them unethical.<br /><br /> An interesting additional question might be to ask whether doc2doc members would ever consider accompanying or supporting someone in going to Dignitas.....or assisting suicide should the law allow this.

702	159	1	Sken<br /><br /> That's a very nicely-balanced analysis.  The question of whether I would accompany someone to Dignitas is difficult; it would seem particularly hard to go somewhere unknown and impersonal but it might be better than their travelling alone.  If the law allowed, I could envisage the possibility of helping someone close to end their life in the right surroundings in certain circumstances.<br /><br /> I can see all the pitfalls but it seems ironic that it's unlawful to help someone carry out an act that is itself lawful.  I can't think of any other circumstances in which that applies but Kirked presumably knows..

708	160	1	It appears from the recent voting on this topic that more than 70% of doctors think that patients should be charged for non-attendance.<br /><br /> There is a benefit in non-attendance - the doctor can play catch-up or grab a cup of coffee.<br /><br /> If the patient is to be penalised for not turning up, surely the other side of the coin is a penalty for the doctor when (s)he is late in seeing the patient?<br /><br /> Fair is fair, folks.

710	161	1	Small children sometimes really, really want things that are just not right/possible.Adults sometimes want the same. Therapists can spend an awful lot of time exploring, empathising around a personal need to have a leg/arm ? Head removed BUT that  should not translate into a rational surgical act by a non abusive provider. If we still really feel that decapitation is going to far but legs are fine, what about the patient who merely wants the fronts of their temporal lobes shaved off because they never liked them?<br /><br /> Is there a good series of patients who have had single limb removal going on to have fully active/meaningful lives subsequently?

711	161	1	"James,<br /><br /> I think, but am happy to be told I'm wrong, that BIID in the form you describe, of patients wanting drastic, amputation surgery to correct a perception of deformity, or dysfunction, is rare. In fact it may be just a part of the spectrum of Body Dysmorphic Disorder, BD, which may include pathological anorexia.  It is suggested that 20% of people who have plastic surgery suffer in this way.<br /><br /> I would suggest that this is a far bigger problem than the sensational aspect, of ""People Who Want Amputations"", and one that you would do better to address rather than that freak show.<br /><br /> JOhn"	John D	2016-03-06 16:34:00	0	0

713	161	1	"Totally tangential , but illustrating a Society aspect of the problem , there is comment in the news to-day on a study suggesting that songs such as ""When I am 64"" (Beatles) a negative effect on the self-esteem of older people which could lead to other health problems. The authors of the study are concerned that old age might be associated with physical decline and unattractiveness. This is of course not the case and the glories of old age are frequently expounded by many pressure groups and denial of old age as a period of decline per se also seems to be denied by some academic geriatricians.... Presumably Shkespeare's seven ages of man will be removed from ""As you like it"". <br /><br />   Along with many older folk , I see old age as a time of progressive decline to the point where the alternative seems increasingly attractive. It is part of who we are - at least those who make it to that stage of life. <br /><br />  How does this fit in with BIID and a wish to be ""disabled"" ? I am not sure it does but perhaps those who wish to grow old and sit back in a comfortable retirement , denying increasing frailty , and gently rot , glass in hand and not using what function remains to them  , could be seen as one end of the spectrum. Concern with our body image and a lack of realism is an aspect of our Society - and humanity - along with failures to use what we have to the full. There are times when it becomes so extreme it needs to be seen as a disease.<br /><br /> James - an interesting topic , but what one would like to see is a history of how it emerges in the patient eg waking one morning and deciding ""my leg offends me"" or does the feeling come on gradually and does this onset affect outcome? Would earlier intervention help?<br /><br /> It would also be interesting to know if there is any particular religious background  cf the New Testament ""Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee  ,cut them off and cast them from thee"" . Is there any equivalent in the Koran ? Anyone ever circumcised themselves? Years ago I remember tales of fakirs who lived with one arm held in the air until it withered from disuse ? Are there any schizoid patients who have been told by ""God"" to have a limb removed?<br /><br /> One individual I came across with this disorder had an interesting variant . A heavily built man making slow progress down the sex-change route . Totally frustrated with the slow progress , he went into one of the lavatories next to A&E and castrated himself. Whateve rthe rights and wrongs of treatment , the depth of anguish which some of these folk feel can be very real.

714	161	1	The BIID seems to fall into a continuum of disorders that would range from the mild body dysmorphic disorder, which in the phenomenological descriptive psychopathologic jargon would be called an 'over-valued idea' up to a 'delusional belief'. BIID seems to contrast a commonly described phenomenon called 'Phantom Limb' as described in Fish's Psychopathology, and Andrew Sims 'Symptoms in the Mind'. Oliver Sacks in his book 'The man who mistook his wife for a hat' postulated that phantom limb could serve a function when prosthetic limb is attached thus he seems to have questioned the 'pathologization of the symptom'.<br /><br /> The issue with rejecting ones limb seems quite easy to pathologise, however, when it comes to aesthetics as the shape of the nose, lips, breasts or buttocks the borderland between dysmorphobia and cosmetic surgeries.

717	162	1	The BBC Health reported a case of aphantasia; describing a man who cannot visualise or form imagery.The only reference cited is from Cortex journal a letter to the editor named lives without imagery; congenital aphantasia. doi:10.1016/j.cortex.2015.05.019<br /><br /> I wonder how much syndromes can be built on single case reports, and I have my concerns about such labels, and whether these would have any significant clinical implication or not. I am not sure I have encoutnered any case of 'aphantasia' I am a bit curious about your practice whether you met with cases that would qualify to this disorder or not.	Sidhom	2015-08-27 07:16:00	0	0
718	162	1	I think this is mainly semantics, plus some variability in human abilities, not pathology.<br /><br /> A visual artist must be able to see what they are trying to achieve, in paint, sculpture or film 'in their mind's eye' to a great degree, while the rest of us have that ability to varying levels of complexity.<br /><br /> Most doctors will have some knowledge of anatomy, and can 'see' the heart beating, the blood circulating. the diaphragm moving in respiration.    'Visualising' more complex movements is much more difficult to understand and visualise, for instance joints, all of which use a complicated combination of rotation and sliding, so that the development of replacements has been slow, aprt from the materials question.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Just closing the eyes sees nothing, blackness apart from the 'phosphenes' you see when you rub your eyes, and varying pressure fires rods and cones at random.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> John	John D	2015-08-27 10:58:00	0	0
719	162	1	I am also a bit sceptical about this.  The authors initially reported a patient who had problems with imagery after a coronary angiogram.  They were then contacted by 20 individuals (all men for what it's worth) who claimed they'd had a similar problem lifelong.  The authors investigated these people by questionnaire and found reduced capacity for imagining.  The authors acknowledge others' scepticism but think that aphantasia may be as real as synaesthesia and that brain functional imaging may help to elucidate what's happening.  As an aside, it seems ironic to use external imaging to investigate internal imaging!<br /><br /> I have never seen anyone claiming this specific disability but surely our capacity to imagine any real or abstract things is on a spectrum and that this can be, at least partly, a learned and learnable skill.  Might there be an analogy with those who display reduced or absent emotional intelligence?  My understanding is that this is the ability to imagine what effect things we do or say may have on others.  Some people with autism presumably have this problem but my understanding is that emotional intelligence is something that can be modified (up or down) with training.<br /><br /> I'll defer to Sidhom and others if I've got this wrong.

720	162	1	How can a person claim to be unable to form imagery, yet by the assertion that he cannot he has in his mind formed an image of the inability to form an image??   Surely this is as John said Semantics,  you cannot be afraid of the lack of fear?   Surely this borders on Whiteheads or Spinozas writings, somewhere in Epistemology or basic Philisophy lies the rubicon of logic regarding such a dilemma.  Occams razor should cut this one to shreds.<br /><br />DuaneF	DuaneF	2015-08-27 14:33:00	0	0
721	162	1	With loss of one of senses it is relatively easy. With anosmia it is easier, one cannot know whether there is a smell or not, with deafness, blindness, loss of touch; it is easy to assess. However, with loss of the unknown to the person, how can this be assessed, does this person draw, how about visuospatial abilities, and navigation skills, how about writing, how did this person learn colours and can he recall them.<br /><br /> I wonder about daydreaming, night dreaming, sexual fantasies, and ability to anticipate based on imagination. Is there a centre for imagination in the brain that can be attributed to this, what else is affected then.<br /><br /> I cannot make sense of it.	Sidhom	2015-08-27 19:09:00	0	0

724	162	1	"Is the reported inability to form mental images really any big deal?  I tried to read a bit about the psychology of this but the confusing literature could make you lose the will to live.<br /><br /> The unsolved argument seems to be whether the subjective ability to form images is the mechanism behind performing complex cognitive and motor tasks or whether these skills depend on some other underlying process that's independent of that pictorial imagery.<br /><br /> I find it difficult to believe that we can perform complex tasks (even hammering a nail into wood rather than our thumb) without the ability to imagine the various 'what ifs' even if these are not pictures.  Otherwise we might have to say that people who claim aphantasia should be barred from driving cars and other potentially dangerous activities.<br /><br /> I'm sure that people who can draw and paint have much better visual imagery than I do but that's perhaps because they see and remember more effectively in the first place.<br /><br /> If I'm being cynical, I suspect that you could invent and describe any mythical ability or disability and find plenty of people who claimed "" Yes, I have exactly that""!"

727	163	1	The Greek tragedians explored the consequences of moral imperatives clashing with human inadequacies, and I feel that this is often what happens with shared decision making in medicine. Every day, distressed people come to see us, and within 10 minutes we are supposed to explore their distress and offer the means of relieving it. The easiest route is often to diagnose “depression” and either pass them over to someone else to deal with it or offer them a drug labelled as an antidepressant. Actually, I don’t think this should ever happen: always first offer understanding, assurance that the distress will get better, the promise of support, and another appointment in the very near future. In the meantime, give them Robert Burton’s advice from The Anatomy of Melancholy: “be not solitary, be not idle.” (see Chris Dowrick’s book Beyond Depression). But at some point thereafter, you may decide to offer an antidepressant drug. The evidence base for these—and especially for comparisons between them—is wretchedly inadequate, as you can discover in Peter Gøtzsche’s new book Deadly Psychiatry and Organised Denial. So how can you actually achieve an informed choice with the patient in front of you? I have to say that I think it’s impossible, given the inadequacy of the evidence. When I tried to create an Option Grid for this, I gave up after months of effort; and long ago, I tried about six of these drugs before I found one that “worked.” Its main effect was to make me feel worse when I came off it. However, the choice may have to be made, faut de mieux. Here is a trial of a Depression Medication Choice (DMC) encounter decision aid conducted by my friends and heroes at the Mayo Clinic. “The DMC decision aid helped primary care clinicians and patients with moderate to severe depression select antidepressants together, improving the decision making process without extending the visit. On the other hand, DMC had no discernible effect on medication adherence or depression outcomes. By translating comparative effectiveness into patient centered care, use of DMC improved the quality of primary care for patients with depression.”	Richard Lehman	2015-10-12 15:41:00	2	0

729	163	1	"In Pakistan and other East Asian countries, patients--and their relatives--attribute their symptoms to a physical cause. Patients remain unconvinced that their symptom such as giddiness or headache has no physical cause. CT scan or MRI is ordered without giving any help in making a diagnosis. When the physician fails to find a physical reason, patient either consults some other physician or approaches faith healers without getting any relief. If the patient is referred to a psychiatrist or the physician prescribes antidepresst or tranquilizer, patient feels offended and blames the physician for failing to find ""actual disease"".Such patients suffer for long time. Even relatives and attendents refuse to believe that the patient is suffering from a psychiatric disease. In such situation it is very difficult to achieve an informed choice. Gnerally a precription of antidepressant goes to the waste basket."	Liaqat	2016-05-13 15:58:00	0	0
730	163	1	"What is ""an informed choice"" ? Sometimes we assume this to refer to the patient's choice at other times it seems to be the doctor who has the dilemma in interpreting information and being ""informed"". Sometimes too the doctor feels if the patient chooses something other than the medical recommendation then the choice must be being made in an absence of being ""informed"".<br /><br /> There will always be patients who view these choices in different ways. If the patient sees the social stigma of depress as something which outweighs potential benefit , that does not mean the choice is less than informed. If the doctor uses a subterfuge and says that the antidepressant drug is to help pain (when this does not really apply) so the patient takes it then  the patient is deprived of the opportunity of making a properly informed choice. The same applies in pain relief. Can one make an informed choice about refusal of therapy , if the effects of that therapy (for better or worse ) have not been tried ? Usually one has to do just that.<br /><br /> Of course the options change as one moves into more severe depression - should  patients who is so depressed as to feel themselves unworthy of treatment be allowe to refuse  - I have faced this dilemma when using ECT. With depression the nature of the beast can impair judgement - but not usually to a significant extent in minor variations and many patients seem able to make an informed choice based on likely benefit and probable side-effects.<br /><br />  Just what is informed choice is a highly complex subject and - as with going to war in Iraq - many folk change their mind retrospectively and opinion changes on whether they had been adequately ""informed"" beforehand. In how we present information to patient we influence how the patient sees this. The hardest bit to assess is often what the treatment or tests will mean to the individual patient - some patients will gain enormous reassurance , way beyond the value of the test , from  ""negative"" test for cancer. Others do not need this. Informed choice involves looking at emotional factors as well as ""hard"" evidence. We can but but recognise factors outside our control. Any form of mental illness makes everything more challenging."	sken	2016-05-15 09:24:00	0	0
731	163	1	I am a GP in Dublin and for the past 10 years I have a special interest in biochemical psychiatry. I went to Sydney in 2006 and it has really changed my practice. In most cases of anxiety/depression typically I prescribe citalopram 10 mg to be doubled in a week. I also do the following tests: plasma zinc, serum copper, caeruloplasmin, histamine, pyrrole and coeliac ab. Routine tests are done too. I find  that I can replace more than half  of patients on meds with nutrient therapy in a few months- zinc , B6, nicotinamide, magnesium, samE etc in individualised doses.<br /><br /> The word has spread and I see a few hundred cases per year, including a number of doctors.It is very satisfying to see so many recover  but I cannot treat everybody.<br /><br /> Recently I got a phone call from a consultant psychiatrist in UK who is starting to learn about this work and who asked me questions for half an hour.<br /><br /> If anybody is interested I would advise starting by  reading Nutrient Power by Dr William Walsh PhD. There is a website at www.walshinstitute,org  and another at www.biobalance.org.au -they organise a course for doctors every year near Syndey. In one week you can start on a path that will utterly change the lives of many people.	Ardfert	2016-05-19 00:58:00	0	0

733	164	1	Of course not all suicidal acts (successful or otherwise) are indicative of underlying mental illness anymore than every acute abdomen is surgical BUT , just as with the acute abdomen and surgery , one has to use the possibility of an underlying mental illness as a starting point. The matter is further complicated as there is some pressure and obligation to try to prevent the suicide whether or not there is mental illness present. And as with the acute abdomen the different underlying strands in diagnosis can take a fair amount of unravelling and even where there is no clear underlying mental illness there may be other factors (eg social) which might be changeable and alter the decision on self-harm.	sken	2016-04-26 23:05:00	0	0

736	166	1	Many research trials build the efficacy of their medication, or intervention based on questionnaires, or inventories, and the difficulty with numbers produced is that they give the illusion of objectivity where as my academic professor would argue they are 'double subjective' as they refer to patient's understanding and willingness to report the symptoms, and interviewer's interpretation of the results.

737	167	1	In his personal view for The BMJ, Jim van Os writes that the language used in current disease classifications implies schizophrenia is a “distinct, genetic brain disease.”<br /><br /> He says, “Strangely, no such language is used for other categories of psychotic illness (schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, and so on).  In fact, even though they constitute 70% of psychotic illness morbidity (only 30% of people with psychotic illness have symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia), these other categories tend be ignored in the academic literature (see box) and on websites of professional bodies. They are certainly not referred to as brain disorders or similar. It’s as if they don’t exist.<br /><br /> “The best way to inform the public and provide patients with diagnoses, therefore, is to forget about “devastating” schizophrenia as the only category that matters and start doing justice to the broad and heterogeneous psychosis spectrum syndrome that really exists.<br /><br /> “ICD-11 should remove the term “schizophrenia.””	Sabreena	2016-02-22 14:03:00	0	0

754	172	1	In contrast to the common folk wisdom that associates happiness with long life, reduced stress etc; a recent Lancet study, unhappiness does not increase mortality. <br />DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01087-9<br />http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2901087-9/fulltext<br />The study adjusted so many factors to reach this conclusion, which impresses me as, I never thought critically of this common wisdom, I wonder what are your opinions about this study.	Sidhom	2015-12-11 21:39:00	0	0
755	172	1	At first glance I would suggest this study is pure Rubbish!   Based largely on the fact it would appear to have been written by a pessimist!   How can someone who is unhappy take pride or happiness in the fact people live longer when they are happy.   There are many studies saying happiness does improve life span and quality...<br /><br />https://news.illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/205399<br /><br />  <br /><br /> I  therefore conclude this study is written by a Happiness hater!   It is no wonder that people who Hate women write articles denouncing womens rights,  same applies to Race, color, creed, religion, etc.  Unhappiness leads to depression, blood pressure and sugar problems, and a host of other illnesses.   I can offer my own medical model,  As a seasoned veteran Law Enforcement officer I was unhealthy the last few years of work.  High blood pressure, gaining weight,  high cholersterol, etc,.  Now Retired from Police work I have perfect Cholesterol, perfect blood pressure, and weight is dropping faster than anything.  I now feel healthy, and can pursue consulting full time, with no pressures.<br /><br /> DuaneF	DuaneF	2015-12-12 14:42:00	0	0
756	172	1	For me, the question is not whether the conclusion is right or wrong but why so much time, money and other resource was wasted on what seems such a pointless study.<br /><br /> I'd not actually been aware that happy people were thought likely to have a longer life expectancy than miserable people but, like all aphoristic wisdom, these ideas are only ever useful if taken in context rather than being applied in a generalised way.  Just looking back anecdotally, I'm aware that most of my friends and acquaintances who died young seemed quite happy people.  Maybe another bit of folk wisdom 'the good die young' (cue a Marvin Gaye song) applied in their cases but I've also known despicable people who were insufferably happy.<br /><br /> It seems at best naive to think that self reporting of such a complex emotion as happiness could have any valid link to life expectancy.  The authors acknowledge that we don't really know how to measure happiness and that seems to be the point: we shouldn't expect to take emotions and try to measure them like physical quantities such a blood pressure or serum cholesterol.  Although we might be able to manipulate certain feelings chemically, eg by altering dopamine, we can't understand and describe emotions adequately by scientific methods. Isn't this why literature and art are so vitally important.<br /><br /> We might improve the chances of a long life by having the right genetics and by avoiding harmful habits but trying to achieve happiness is often self-defeating.  If we're lucky enough to have it, a slightly shorter, happy life might anyway be preferable to a longer miserable one.

I am a very strong supporter of developing sporting options for those with a disability - perhaps particularly relevant for some of those injured in military service and one always hopes some of the technical advances will have a knock on effect for some of those less in the public eye.<br /><br /> My queries are in part about the complexity of the classifications and how these are implemented. I also feel that for some contests the more affluent countries have an unfair advantage where equipment is concerned.<br /><br /> In recent months there have been a couple of interesting developments. The first was the disqualification of a woman from the an canoeing on the grounds that her paralysis was fuctional rather than physical. the second was the decision that blind riders should wear a blindfold - some riders will be blind but have say 10% residal vision.Perhaps that should be enough , but who checks ? And just which disabilities should have their events - it will be interesting when a decision is finally made on whether gross obesity is accepted as a clear disability.<br /><br /> There are also a few sports where the disability concerned really seems very little impediment.<br /><br /> I am all in favour of somewhat specialist Games - for doctors , transplant patients and any other groups including those with degrees of disability or old age, but sometimes wonder whether we are losing a sense of perspective in our attempts to do the ""right thing""."	sken	2015-12-04 13:56:00	0	0

It is not the level to which we are inspired but what the Games do for the rank and file for disability that counts.<br /><br /> Personally I do not like the idea of ""buying"" victory in part whether pharmaceutically or in equipment (some compromise is inevitable). One of the reasons why I like running and Laser (a one design class) sailing competitions.

765	176	1	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has come a long way and is still moving forward with new developments being announced almost every day. Before, there was a clear line between CT and MRI, but that black and white concept is fading away. With the introduction of powerful modules and software, there might come a time in the future where it won’t matter which diagnostic method is performed, granted of course if there are specific indications or contraindications. With newer generation CT scanners to lower dosage while increasing quality, but MRI has no serious side effects related to increase in field strength. This is why researchers and clinicians are waiting with open arms for 7T MRI and beyond.<br /><br />MRI takes advantage of the fact that water is located in all tissues and organs, creating a signal which is then formed into an image. However, many people are unaware that MRI can be used to study other elements, like sodium, phosphorus and others. Sodium is a very important element in the human body. The only isotope that is stable is 23Na, which is the most abundant form. In the human body it regulates blood flow, blood pressure, osmotic pressure and pH. Sodium chloride, more commonly known as table salt, is our main source of sodium. You may have heard or read that salt is bad for your health, but abnormally low levels of sodium can also adversely affect health. The American Heart Association recommends ingesting less than 1,500 mg per day, which is considerably less than their previous number 2,300 mg per day. They explain that because hypertension risk is so high among Americans, 1,500 is the number that exemplifies perfect cardiovascular health. Obviously this number is not for everybody, because competitive athletes, people who work in conditions with elevated temperatures, i.e. those who sweat a lot, will require more sodium intake.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Source: http://bimedis.com/latest-news/browse/97/7t-sodium-cardiac-mri-may-be-a-game-changer	stevenklark73	2016-05-25 13:06:00	0	0

Answered my own question!   23(usually written as a superscript)Na is the only stable isotope and is the one that alnost all sodium exists as!   24Na and 22Na have half lives measured in hours and years and exist as traces in nature and our bodies, the rest have half lives in seconds to milliseconds.    23Na is an isotope, but the one we would consider as 'normal' sodium.<br /><br /> John"	John D	2016-05-26 10:13:00	0	0

There seems little possibility that populations are prepared to modify their intake of excess food or sodium although individuals may do so. <br /><br />  Interesting experience on the train yesterday : 2 seats on either side of the of the carriage as ""priority seats"" for the frail  etc... Each pair of seats was taken by a truly enormously obese woman. One of them tried to take as little room as possible but still left nothing except for a cachexic person. The other truly flowed into the entire double space. This is where we are heading in the UK at least and as with so much else these are the folk who will dictate design of transport etc... in the future. So just be sure your new generation of scanners are big enough. The Caribbean island I visited recently had just bought a scanner for its population of 35,000 - but residents are often so overweight that they have to be exported to another island for an MRI."	sken	2016-05-27 09:10:00	0	0
768	177	1	"For the past 40 years we have had escalating concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and increasingly we are now heading towards over restriction on prescribing. We will never get it completely right and clearly doctors need some official backing for their trying to refuse (and often upset ) many patients who demand them for the wrong reasons. The recent emphasis on patient responsibility is belated but very welcome.<br /><br />  But there will be a knock on effect. There will be those - including children - where antibiotics will not be given when that should have done. We may have to live with that but the judiciary is unlikely to see it hat way if a case comes to court. The suggestion of an instant test to detect whether there is a bacterial infection is unlikely to have universal application and has yet to be developed..  There are also some messy areas - is a higher dose more likely to breed resistant bugs ? Is the use of a combination better or worse? Should we really be waging war on common relatively commensal bugs such as Helicobacter pylori , whenever it is found , with a wide range of potent antibiotics - or other common problems such as Campylobacter jejuni and Clostridium when not causing significant disease? There are many borderline conditions where individual patients may feel a beneficial response but one might ""get by"" without prescribing (think UTI in women). And just what are we meant to do about gonorrhoea with its the rising incidence and drug resistance ? <br /><br /> Interestingly I gather the veterinary and farming use is far more relevant in the development of resistance to our more specialised antibiotics. But can one envisage vets refusing to treat someone's dog - a child perhaps - but certainly not a pet dog.....<br /><br /> The first step needs to be education of the public - as much as doctors - after all they are the folk with the biggest personal stake in good care. At last there really does seem to be a campaign for this. The second step is to ensure the pharmaceutical industry receives adequate support to seek out new antibiotics rather than just going for more profitable compounds for shareholder profits. And of course a few additional vaccines against some common infections would not go amiss."	sken	2016-05-19 20:27:00	0	0

818	187	1	Sidhom - it is unclear from your post whether it is addressing your worries or those of your patients. I think it is helpful to think along the lines of the answer from Odysseus.  CXR equivalents can be very useful - it can sometimes be helpful in discussion with very aggressive parents pushing for inappropriate CT scans on a child. In general I have the impression that it is the doctor who is a bit casual about irradiation - but that is in the reassessment of patients not in the A&E setting . Most  x-rays requests there are usually very low dose but that does not mean one should not have good indications for the request .	sken	2014-04-01 12:58:00	0	0

838	189	1	Hi Sken,<br /><br /> I was waiting for that particular bone to be picked, so thank you!  The article itself does not give any measurements of dose, and so 'low-dose' CT is presumed to be a recognised entity as separate to 'normal dose' clinical CT.  <br /><br /> But the first reference from the paper (avaiable from the NEJM here) does mention that the imaging parameters for 'low-dose' CT were set to give an effective dose of 1.5 mSv per scan, down from the 'normal dose' estimated at 8 mSV.  The big question is whether the cancer induction risks are also reduced by 1/5, which is not really possible to determine if they are considered to be stochastic...<br /><br /> Weighing in at 0.015 mSv, a PA chest radiograph still packs x100 less of a dose punch than 'low-dose' CT.<br /><br /> What would you rather have?	hip radiologist	2013-09-05 15:33:00	0	0
839	189	1	Many thanks - I had been surprised that it had not been mentioned in the article. My impression is that doctors are nearly always a bit embarassed by radiation risks (this is being charitable , as I think the problem is often ignorance) and request repeat studies far too often. This can happen almost irrespective of guidelines in response to patient or medical anxieties. I would also like to be convinced about slightly earlier diagnosis making a major difference to outcome.

846	190	1	A research team from Johns Hopkins University has discovered evidence that abnormal function of the left atrium may lead to an increase in stroke risk. As the study showed, the risk for stroke was not dependent on the presence of atrial fibrillation. The findings go against the universally accepted notion that irregular rhythm in the upper chambers of the heart during atrial fibrillation (AF) causes blood clots to form, eventually finding their way to the brain.<br /><br />The study was motivated by the knowledge that the current reasoning for stroke doesn’t fit in with what clinicians see on a daily basis – not all individuals with atrial fibrillation have strokes and not all stroke victims have atrial fibrillation. So this means that people with abnormal function of the left atrium are at risk for stroke, not only those with AF. <br /><br /><br />Lead author and cardiologist Dr. Hiroshi Ashikaga, PhD, and his team f used a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom Avanta, Siemens Healthcare) with motion­tracking software called multimodality tissue­tracking (MTT) made by Toshiba to study the movement of the myocardium (cardiac muscle).<br /><br />   <br /><br /><br />Interesting?

851	193	1	"I was interested by an article in the Guardian on the 16th April 2014, ""Scans find conciousness in brain-injured patients"": http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/16/pet-scans-predict-brain-injury-recovery-trials    The online article included a link to the Lancet paper it was based on, and I fear that the tone of the Gaurdian's article was at odds with the paper.    You can decide for yourselves, if you read the abstract at: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)60042-8/abstract<br /><br /> The article said that the paper raised ""ethical questions about the best treatment for those in an unresponsive state."" and quoted one of the  authors, Prof. Steven Laureys of the University of Liege, as saying that, ""a third of the patients referred to them by doctors elsewhere had been misdiagnosed.""    I fear that this is a personal opinion of the Prof's, as the abstract contains no evidence to that effect.<br /><br /> The study involved 41 patients referred to the hospital over five years.   The investigators used clinical tests as the 'gold standard' and compared those with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using a glucose analogue to highlight metabolic activity, and Functional Magnetic Resonace Imaging (fMRI).   They also assessed outcome after a year.<br /><br />   They found that, ""PET had high sensitivity for identification of patients in a minimally conscious state and high congruence with behavioural CRS—R scores.""    fMRI was less sensitive.  They also found that, "" 13 of 42 (32%) of the behaviourally unresponsive patients (ie, diagnosed as unresponsive with CRS—R) showed brain activity compatible with (minimal) consciousness (ie, activity associated with consciousness, but diminished compared with fully conscious individuals) on at least one neuroimaging test; 69% of these (9 of 13) patients subsequently recovered consciousness"" but offered no comparision with clinical testing.   Moreover, the conclusion found that, "" Cerebral 18F-FDG PET could be used to complement bedside examinations and predict long-term recovery of patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome."" (My underline)   That is very different from misdiagnosis or an ethical diliemma.<br /><br /> John"	John D	2014-04-17 20:24:00	0	0
852	193	1	"If a patient is diagnosed as PVS but subsequently found to have MCS (or even locked in syndrome as I think was found for one patient here) then there has perhaps been some misdiagnosis. As new tests and techniques emerge there is bound to be some reclassification and this seems to be what journalists are trying to highlight. This is similar to the work from Cambridge and must be pretty horrific for many of the public . It raises many ethical issues about pain (or potential pain management) , feeding etc...  For many people this is close to the ultimate awfulness of modern medicine - I remember a meeting a few years ago when only a handful of people in a large audience would have wanted to continue in this twilight state , but it will be difficult for doctors not to continue ""care"". There is also the problem of consciousness on these tests - how far does it correlate with significant awareness - certainly from what I have read earlier it does not seem to be enough for patient involvement about decisions for ongoing care."	sken	2014-04-17 21:56:00	0	0

863	195	1	We have a local stroke protocole in Wales. We give Aspirin of 300mg od for two weeks for the pateints with an ischaemic stroke. Then we switch the patient to Clopidogrel of 75mg OD. Recently I came across a report of 85 years old woman who presented with cerebral small vessel disease and after a week of being on 300mg Aspirin she developed a bilateral brain haemorrhage. This haemorraghic transformation is more expected in Elderly patients. I think we might need to revisit the protocole and start presribing the 75mg dose of Aspirin rather than the 300mg. What do you think?	Amer Jafar	2011-09-27 14:53:00	0	0
864	195	1	There aedifferent protocols for treatment following ischaemic stroke. The 75mg aspirin makes more sense in elderly especially if they have also diabetes.I have seen hospitals that give aspirin 75 mg+s.c. clexane 40-60 mg once a day.Others favor clopidogrel 75 mg, which is quite well tolerated by the elderly.High doses of aspirin in the elderly might be risky. I also don't think higher doses have proven more beneficial in stroke prevention, while the side effects of cerebrel haemorrhage and GI haemorrrhage are real risks.	yoram chaiter	2011-09-27 18:31:00	0	0

873	196	1	I was doing my ward round in our acute stroke ward few days ago, when I noticed that on this week we had two patients with significant postural drop in their blood pressure without being on antihypertensive. The sensory autonomic dysfunction is partly contributing but what is about the management. The physiotherapist rightly very concerned as the patients were limited in what they can do in this case.Starting the patient with postural hypotension on fludrocortisone is an important issue in view of the nature of the original cerebral ischaemic event.

882	197	1	Aspirin resistance  denotes those situations when it is unable to protect individuals from  thrombotic complications, or when it fails to produce an anticipated  effect in laboratory tests of platelet function. There are various  laboratory techniques with which to evaluate the effectiveness of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs. It has been estimated that in 5-60% of patients, aspirin  does not achieve adequate efficacy in various measures of platelet  activity. Some studies have revealed that vascular patients shown by  laboratory tests to be aspirin-resistant are at an increased risk of major vascular events. The suggested mechanisms of aspirin resistance, among others, include genetic polymorphisms, alternate pathways of platelet activation, aspirin-insensitive thromboxane biosynthesis, drug interactions, or low aspirin dose. An increase in the dosage of aspirin or conversion to clopidogrel or clopidogrel plus aspirin might be beneficial in the management of those patients who are aspirin resistant	haider77	2013-07-13 19:48:00	0	0

He walks with the help of a Walker. He reports suffering from a Pain in the Hamstring and in the lumbar region of the back. The pain had it's onset 5 months ago. He doesn't have fever or had before the begin of the disease. No dermatologic findings or history.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Pain:<br /><br /> reports pain when sitting down but less when laying down. It is symmetrical and bilateral. When pressing the Hamstrings he reports ""very strong pain"" (on a scale of 0 to 20 it's a 15) and when moving the distal part of the leg it's a 10 (strong pain). There is a wakness throughout the leg. NO pain above the lumbar region.<br /><br /> Pain seems to be muscular.<br /><br /> Tests:<br /><br /> - on a previous hospital he had a back MRI. Results: Light protrusion in L4-L5 and L5-S1. <br /><br /> -Ordered: CPK, CBC and EMG <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Overall: On my assesment I find that the pain in the back is due to the protrusions but is not significant when determining the source of the Myalgia.<br /><br /> DDX: - Attending proposed Juvenile Dermatomyositis but I disagree due to the lack of dermatologic findings<br /><br /> - Myositis <br /><br /> - Becker's muscle dystrophy: The time of onset (14 years) and the pain in the proximal lower limbs. There is history missing to confirm it. Against: No pain in the Proximal Upper Limbs. <br /><br /> -Muscle dystrophys. <br /><br />  <br /><br /><br /><br /> Well, as you might have noticed I am a first year medical Student so I know I don't  present the case with the adequate words. The history missing to further think about Beckers is due to the fact that I came with the idea after rearech after the consult.<br /><br /> Thank you very much,<br /><br /> Gabriel"	gabriel312	2015-01-08 23:44:00	1	0

I'll also tweet this so hopefully someone should be able to help (I'm not a doctor). <br /><br /> It's lovely to have members from all over the world and (to my knowledge) not sure we've had anyone posting from Peru before.<br /><br /> Best wishes<br /><br /> Anne	AnneG	2015-01-09 10:30:00	0	0
926	210	1	Hi Anne, <br /><br /> thanks for the nice reply.<br /><br /> Regarding the case I can now say for sure, that it wasn't any of the DDx proposed above as the CPK levels came completely normal. Other tests came also negative. <br /><br /> The patient was deferred to Psychiatry to evaluate for Somatic syndrom disorder.<br /><br /> Thanks again,<br /><br /> Gabriel	gabriel312	2015-01-10 03:20:00	0	0
927	211	1	Awoke this morning to hear that GPs are going to have a six month trial of being paid 55 pound for every new case of dementia that they diagnose. This seems to me to be wrong on many levels. If dementia were a disease that could be cured  then I would have no problem in making more diagnoses of dementia and 'curing' them. There is now medication for dementia. One of the problems is that to me the medication usually does not often  work and never cures.<br /><br /> There are many down sides to the patient and not many up sides to a person diagnosed with dementia.<br /><br /> Imagine you are old, living reasonably in a nursing home and your GP diagnoses you with dementia. You will probably have to move to a dementia home , where all the patients have dementia.<br /><br /> Fuming into my coffee prior to this morning's Surgery.<br /><br /> I assume that it is just another Government silly idea. I doubt that the Civil Servant or Political Aide who thought up the idea will be sacked, but in my opinion he or she should be. I hope it is not a politically motivated idea to discredit GPs and thus the NHS and make all who can afford to go private, go private and watch the NHS crumble.<br /><br /> Almost makes me glad I am retiring.<br /><br /> Almost but not quite.

935	212	1	It is generally common knowledge there is a link with stress and MS.  Relapsing remitting MS patients report occasionally stress as a trigger of relapses. <br /><br /> Mind-body medicine is an area which MS research is currently exploring and I think will become a vital and increased area for MS research.  Stress management for MS patients is currently being researched.  This raises one of the previous discussions on this forum regarding the role of complementary and alternative medicine.  In MS I think a more integrative and holistic approach is required and it seems it could be heading that way. Any thoughts anyone?	Loess	2014-09-15 11:33:00	0	0
936	212	1	I think sarcoidosis can be precipitated by stress. The trouble is we are so inept at defining and diagnosing stress from an immunopatholical point of view. <br /><br /> We all know we get cold sores on our lips when we are stressed but show me one test we have which tells me anymore than your mother knows about your current state of health. Indeed, my mother can tell whether I am well just by looking at me. <br /><br /> Stress remains the dark matter of modern medicine.<br /><br /> Odysseus	Odysseus	2014-09-15 12:36:00	0	0
937	212	1	Actually stress causes lots of serious problem. Studies have shown, in many cases major life events or the way people response to them usually leads to trigger the chances of MS relapse thus directly or indirectly such major event also leads to stress in human being.	Michael Berry	2014-09-15 13:21:00	0	0
938	212	1	I think it is important for neurologists to help the MS patient identify the cause of the stress.  This could be stress caused by the patients work, relationships and home life or life events. <br /><br /> The neurologist needs to put on their detective hat and ask a few questions if the MS patient mentions stress. The patient may not even be diagnosed with MS (it may only be suspected) at this stage so I think it is vital neurologists are prepared for this.   Also to find out how long the patient has been stressed for and to find out the severity of the stress level, such as out of 1-10. Just by asking the patient out of 1-10 how stressed are you? 10 being the most stressed.<br /><br /> Then to warn the patient they need to get out of that stressful situation/ environment.  A bit more difficult to do if it is life events but stress management can help.<br /><br /> Not all MS patients and CIS patients may be aware of the link of MS and stress and that stress may trigger a relapse.

939	212	1	"If stress is a trigger for MS, then tecniques that are directed are reducing stress should show a benefit.    This recent meta-analysis found only a ""possible benefit to the use of meditation"" , which is the same as saying there is no evidence that it does.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105026<br /><br /> Even the Alternative Medicine school is as negative, as shown by this paper about the effect of massage therapy on MS: ""The results displayed no significant changes in 6MWT distances or HAQUAMS scores. However, the participants perceived improvement in overall health as expressed in written comments.""  In other words there was  a placebo, but no real improvement.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24949078<br /><br /> Which should be no surprise in a disease that is subject to remission and relapse as much as MS.   Instead, demanding that neurologists give up science and adopt  'holistics' would be a waste of their time.<br /><br /> JOhn"	John D	2014-09-15 18:10:00	0	0
940	212	1	There are many cases of stress triggering MS relapses.  It would not be a case of neurologists giving up science.  There is the paper<br /><br />Epub: Mohr et al.

Neurology. 2012 Jul.<br /><br />RESULTS: SMT-MS resulted in a reduction in cumulative Gd+ lesions (p = 0.04) and greater numbers of participants remained free of Gd+ lesions during the treatment (76.8% vs 54.7%, p = 0.02), compared to participants receiving the control treatment. SMT-MS also resulted in significantly reduced numbers of cumulative new T2 lesions (p = 0.005) and a greater number of participants remaining free of new T2 lesions (69.5% vs 42.7%, p = 0.006).

941	212	1	"Loess,<br /><br /> That report has two comments attached to it.  One is an interpetation for lay readers of the article.  The other is a review, whose full text I cannot access, but which is abstracted as,<br /><br />""Psychological stress has been suspected to play a role in multiple sclerosis (MS) since Jean-Martin Charcot first described the disease. Moreover, patients with MS intuitively make a connection between times of high psychological stress and exacerbations of their illness. In contrast to this anecdotal evidence, a systematic review by a task force assembled by the American Academy of Neurology in 1999 concluded that ""at present, the prospective data are insufficient to establish any such relationship [between psychological stress and MS] with reasonable medical certainty.""<br /><br /> Which truncation makes me wonder if the authors were setting out to either back up, or put down the previous review.   Any have access to Neurology?<br /><br /> Does that journal regularly include such lay reviews of the papers it publishes? MS is such an awful, disabling disease that there are many anxious patients out there , straining for hope.   Is this something for the BMJ to think on, in other fields?<br /><br />   JOhn"	John D	2014-09-16 10:21:00	0	0

Unfortunately the anxiety got out of control for various reasons including many disturbed nights sleep and hyperacusis causing night time anxiety attacks.<br /><br /> Treatment - possibly IV steroids and something to reduce the servere anxiety.  Any suggestions as this would have involved mixing medications.  thanks.

951	214	1	"Hi Loess.<br /><br /> It is difficult to comment on the case specifically, as there is little detail about the actual symptoms the patient had, detailed investigations and CNS imaging findings, their psychiatric history, pre-morbid functioning, and cognitive function, but I'd like to make some general comments which I hope will be of use.<br /><br />  Firstly, loss of consciousness is never a feature of anxiety or lack of sleep. I would be looking for an alternative organic explanation as you would with any other patient, including CNS reasons and the usual cardiovascular and respiratory pathologies.<br /><br /> Psychiatric symptoms are common with MS, both during exacerbations and in between episodes. While euphoria and an incongruent sense of well-being are the classical features, depression, sometimes with anxiety, is at least as common. Of course, steroids are also beset with psychiatric side-effects and, while essential medications, may also be exacerbating the patients anxiety. Cognitive impairment is also a common feature of an exacerbation of MS. These features may be due to the CNS inflammatory processes themselves,  psychological factors around adjusting to illness, and/or side effects of treatments. <br /><br /> I'm not sure what you mean by ""the anxiety got out of control"", but it would be prudent to exclude other psychiatric symptoms, such as psychosis, which is rare but possible with MS, and mania, given the difficulties with sleep. Of course, the treatment of such a constellation of symptoms would be different than what you would offer for anxiety alone. <br /><br /> I also don't really want to comment on specific medications for your patient, as all cases are different, but if the psychiatric picture consists of anxiety symptoms alone, non-pharmacological treatments should always be attempted first. Simple behavioural measures such as attempting to compensate for cognitive deficits, a detailed behavioural journal and some simple strategies (depending on what comes out of the journal) would all be helpful. I would even go as far as to suggest a more formal cognitive behavioural therapy if the patient is willing and able to participate in this. As for medications, I would probably offer some low dose atypical antipsychotic (ensuring a normal ECG, BP, and no potential contraindications or medication interactions), or low dose benzodiazepine only if absolutely required. The side effects of psychotropics can often muddy the waters with CNS diseases, and I would be cautious in using them. Of course, one would expect the symptoms to improve as the MS improves, so the patient woud need frequent review and the treatment modified accordingly.<br /><br /> Finally, one should always take into account risk of self-harm, so this should always be asked about and managed appropriately.<br /><br /> Managing patients such as this certainly makes the case for the involvement of a liaison psychiatrist in your clinic, or at least access to one in your hospital!"	ljc123	2014-06-10 01:18:00	0	0

953	214	1	Patient was suffering from stress already and had severe complications with the VI nerve palsy. <br /><br />The VIth and VIIth (facial nerve) have their nuclei (nerve cell bodies) close together in the brain stem; hence a large MS lesion in the brain stem can cause both a 6th and 7th nerve palsy amongst other things and hence can be associated with hyperacusis. <br /><br /> Due to the brain stem lesion causing the VI nerve palsy patient was suffering from hyperacusis at night. They were also was suffering at night from severe phonophobia (anxiety of anticipating a sound or fear of a sound), this is often associated with hyperacusis. Phonophobia is an anxiety disorder.  They were also suffering from severe hypervigilence and were an insomniac at night waiting in anticipation.<br /><br /> Not very nice for the patient and this is why patient deteriorated.

964	216	1	I am interested in finding out the procedure at different hospitals for a VI nerve palsy caused by MS.<br /><br /> Patient in this case was initally examined by neurology, then an urgent (within two weeks) MRI scan was offered, and was advised possible swelling on the brain. MRI was done four days after this. Patient was then telephoned by neurology registrar with MRI results two days after this (due to weekend) then instructed to get oral steroid prescription from GP surgery.  During this phone call they were informed 'swelling on the brain as suspected' by neurology registrar.<br /><br /> Patient had UTI dipstick check at GP surgery and was given diagnosis of 'inflammatory looking lesions which may or may not be MS' by GP on same day.<br /><br /> Do other hospitals follow same/similar procedure for an MS VI nerve palsy?  I understand some neurologists are keen to make sure UTI check is thorough and at the hospital rather than GP surgery (Due to potential complications with oral steroids).

967	218	1	I am an old age psychiatrist. I am surprised to hear that that there is loss of interest in dementia. There are emerging new medications in dementia (etanrecept, dimebon) and new doses of established ones as well (Donepzil 23.5 mg). The DSM 5 used the term neurocognitive disorder instead of dementia and demential with lewy bodies became an official diagnosis.<br /><br /> What I think may pose some difficulty is that dementia and a few other disorders, do not belong strictly to neurology or psychiatry. They form their own domain that can be called neuropsychiatry, behavioural neurology or organic psychiatry.  If compared to psychiatric disorders, most if not all dementia have clear underlying neuropathology, that can be verified by imaging, MRI, DaTScan etc. As compared to neurology, most of the presentation is primarily behavioural.

970	218	1	Probably the last thing that an old age psychiatrist would want to prescribe is an antipsychotic. If you mean behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), then, they are best dealt with non-pharmacological interventions, the doctor may want to also to allow time for Choline Esterase Inhibitors (ChE-I) to help with this. Antipsychotics are quite awkward to handle with dementia. Some antipsychotics (AP) esp. SGAs raise the risk of stroke, some are known for metabolic syndrome and QTc interval prolongation. Some APs have an anticholinergic effect and may worsen cognitive functions, some do not have marked anticholinergic effect, but have extra-pyramidal side effects (EPSE), which may require the use of an antimuscarinic which may worsen cognitive functions. Patients with Parkinson's dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies are particularly sensitive to high potency antipsychotics.	Sidhom	2013-12-12 19:11:00	0	0

973	219	1	Hi all, I badly need some help.<br /><br /> I'm a GP myself, and am unsure where to go from here. I've had pain in the metatarsal heads region bilaterally for about 7 months now. It started off in my left foot when I was running a lot, gradually progressed to the point where I could hardly walk. The pain was sharp, in the ball of my foot and occured on lifting off the ground. I was tender over the distal metatarsal shafts. I saw an orthopaedic surgeon and a physio at the time, the consensus was I either had a metatarsal stress fracture or was about to have one, and we elected not to get any imaging as the treatment was the same regardless - just rest it. I wore a cam boot for a month, during which time I started to get the exact same symptoms in the right foot - just from walking around at work. <br /><br /> The physio made me orthotics with metatarsal domes which worked up to a point - they relieved the pain initially, but when I started trying to walk a bit more (and I don't mean much - like parking at the far end of the car park rather than at the front door of the supermarket) it all flared up again.<br /><br /> So I saw another physio, on the recommendation of a friend. His assessment was that my plantar fascia was extremely tight, and set about releasing it. I ditched the metatarsal domes at this stage. I rolled my foot on a golf ball every night with great relief.  Over about 2 months things greatly improved to the point where I could walk around normally.<br /><br /> Things went pear-shaped when I tried running again - gentle runs, on flat grass, no more than two or three laps of a football field. Each time I've tried it's caused a flare and I've had to cease all activity.<br /><br /> My last attempt at running was 2 weeks ago, and since then the soft tissues over the plantar fascia have been really swollen and tender, which has never happend before in all of this. The golf ball, which before had nightly relieved my pain, now made things worse. I went back to the physio who did his usual manual stretching and massage, and instead of improving things it's made the inflammation worse. I have a dull burning sensation in my plantar fascia at night, and pain and a crackling sensation in the ball of my foot whenever I lift off the ground.<br /><br /> I'm at the end of my tether. I'm in my 30s and can barely walk. To me the whole thing seems like a mechanical problem, but I'm uncertain as to the exact diagnosis - everything I've read suggests plantar fasciitis causes heel, not metatarsal head, pain; and reliable information on metatarsalgia is hard to find.<br /><br /> I haven't gotten expert help sooner as I know I don't need an operation, and am reluctant to have a steroid injection, so what's an orthopod going to do for me? But I've realised I'm my own worst enemy and have booked an appointment. But any advice as to what might be going on or what I can do in the next month while I'm waiting to see them would be greatly appreciated.	Gracie1986	2016-05-21 01:28:00	0	0
974	219	1	Gracie,<br /><br /> I'm an anaesthetist - what do I know about sports injuries?<br /><br /> Nothing, except that from my contact with sports doctors as an Olympic volunteer, I know that athletes don't get expert care from 'ordinary' clinicians and paramedical specialists.    Try to get referred to a sport specialist - your physio is more liklely to know one than most orthopaedic surgeons (Who, and whose specialty I respect).    Do you have a professional football/rugby team locally?    If you run, do you belong to a club?  They may help to find you one.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, keep up your fitness with non-weightbearing exercise, swimming and the gym.   ??Cycling?<br /><br /> Good luck!<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-05-21 10:03:00	0	0
975	219	1	"Golly - you really have tried. I can only re-inforce the comment by John D. In the old days one would have recommended an old style rheumatologist but these seem a different breed these days and I think see things savouring of old-style physical medicine as beneath their more esoteric skills. You clearly have an ongoing problem but in the short term you need to find some other sporting activity which you can do. Running may be a bad activity for you - when I had to stop eventually I turned to cycling . That may just be feasible - with cleated pedals and good cycling shoes it is possible to keep the foot fairly rigid and not put too much pressure on the sole (using the upstroke more - great for the abdominals...) . The cleats can be moved to try to find a ""sweet spot"". There are other sports as well - I even resorted to swimming for a short period of recovery at one time , but not something I would do from choice. <br /><br /> I suspect that thee must be a number of physios around who have a particular interest in running injuries and problems from ""overuse"" but my impression is that some of what is practised and argued is a trifle fanciful. The other problem is time scale - orthopaedic folk often think in terms of months or years whilst the sportsperson thinks in days or just possibly weeks. Perhaps when one gives an active person advice to rest it should be accompanied by CBT for depression ?"	sken	2016-05-21 11:47:00	0	0
976	219	1	Thank you all for the comments! And yes, I have been feeling incredibly low these last few months, running was my main stress release - you've hit the nail on the head with CBT! I've been swimming but only out of necessity, I don't enjoy it nearly as much. There aren't very many sports medicine specialists in the area but I will try to look further afield.

977	220	1	News of the sudden death of 30 year old Claire Squires at the end of the London Marathon on Sunday has led to widespread shock,sympthay and donations to the Samaritans for whom she was running. Cause of death of this fit, slim 30 year old hairdresser who had already run a marathon before, is still unknown.So should we be advising patients to avoid extreme sports and marathon runnning? There have been 10 deaths during the London marathon since its inception in 1981 (no data on the week or so after).  The last death was in 2007 when a 22-year-old fitness instructor died of hyponatraemia,presumably due to overdrinking. Most fatalities are due to undiagnosed underlying heart problems (would that be conduction problems in the young?)Given the numbers running, the fatality rate is reassuringly low. I suppose the question is whether an ecg to check for conduction defect and/ or echo to look for cardiomyopathy are worthwhile before embarking on training for a marathon. The pick up rate's going to be very low but is there any down side (apart from time,money and false reassurance)? Certainly, if there's a family history of sudden death, should we suggest investigations?I've just run my first and last marathon at the age of 52. My dad dropped dead of a heart attack at 48 but I figured that if I didnt get any chest pain while training, I'd probably be ok. And I was.  I didn't really consider having any checkups before. What do you think? Foolhardy or rational?http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/24/claire-squires-donations-london-marathon?newsfeed=true	ann robinson	2012-04-25 14:56:00	1	0

979	220	1	Hi Ann,Firstly, congratulations on your first marathon.  It is a gargantuan effort and I'm sure positions you well to understand the duress the body is placed under before, during and after such trials.There are a few intersting points here. Of course, the marvellous case of Fabrice Muamba highlights the stark contrast in possible outcomes. Tragic or miraculous, these are sensational stories for the media that distort the reality of the risks involved - expert, politically unmotivated and media-free opinion can be the only guide here...But does knowing actually help? Are we able to predict those at risk accurately enough to avoid the psychologically and physically detrimental effects of knowing that if you push it too hard, you could die?When I was at school, there was a boy in my house called Richard van Rossum who knew he had a deadly cardiac arrhythmia.  He had an internal defibrillator/pacing device.  He was a marvellous guy, full of spirit, and very active.  He played many sports and did so well.  And with all that, he collapsed and died running to a History lesson.  It was a huge shock, especially considering the circumstances, but something he and his family understood could happen.  His father, an Olympic hurdler, continued to coach at the school for a few years after his death, which was such a typically selfless gesture of the family and was hugely appreciated. What can you do?	hip radiologist	2012-04-25 14:56:00	0	0

( propably there are other mistakes also , but i hope that you will tolerate me until i perfect my english )Posted by ikarosGreat to see the discussion. This is a topic we grapple with at the BMJ. Clearly the benefits of physical activity greatly outweigh the slightly increased risk of sudden death while exercising. In older people the most common causes of sudden death are ischaemic heart disease in contrast to those in younger people. In Italy, sports club members need to be screened. In France, you need to provide a note/certificate to say you are fit to exercise (How a doctor decides is another issue!). In the UK, you just turn up. Should people be screened?

985	220	1	I do have problems with the concept of road running per se (as opposed to running on fields, beaches or forestry tracks) bcause I think, even with the best training shoes, you are doing repeated damage to you ankles, knees, hips and lumbar spine which will come back to haunt you. I know it from first hand experience. I spent my youth playing football, tennis, squash, volleyball, basket ball, etc. on an almost daily basis but almost always on hard surface such as clay. Now in my late 40s my knees and hips hurt :-(I don't run myself (my sore knees and hips now prefer yoga and non-weighbearing activities like swimming) but I am led to believe by friends who do run seriously that you should change your running shoes every 8 weeks if you are a serious runner otherwise all their support has gone. But in reality how many folks do that? Certainly none of my running friends do!	skyesteve	2012-04-25 15:23:00	0	0
986	220	1	Here is an answer to the question about what the causes are of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young (it's from BJSM (Br J Sports Med) http://tiny.cc/e97bdwA broad spectrum of cardiac and non-cardiac causes, both congenital and  acquired, have been implicated in causing SCA in athletes. Data from  the USA and Italy indicate that structural cardiac disease accounts  for 60–95% of the causes of SCA,21,–,23  and mainly includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrythmogenic right  ventricular dysplasia and congenital coronary artery                                  anomalies in the under-35-year-old  group. Coronary artery disease predominates in the over-35-year-old group. Common pathway in all these conditions is ventricular                                  fibrillation (VF) as the main  presenting rhythm in SCA.24 In the under-16-year-old age group, commotio cordis (cardiac contusion) is thought to be responsible for up to 20% of SCAs.                                  It is very uncommon after 21 years of age.25 26. Other cardiac causes of SCA  include myocarditis, ruptured aortic aneurysm, aortic valve                                  stenosis, mitral valve prolapse,  dilated cardiomyopathy, drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias and the  ion-channelopathies29  which include the long and short QT syndrome (caused by sodium or  potassium ion channel genetic mutations), Brugada syndrome                                  (defective sodium channel gene) and  familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia30 (abnormal ryanodine receptor regulating calcium release). Non-cardiac causes of SCA include asthma, heat stroke, cerebral                                  artery rupture and exertional rhabdomyolysis secondary to sickle cell trait.               via Karim Khan, MBBS, PhD - editor, BJSM	KKhan	2012-04-25 21:26:00	0	0

990	223	1	In general , I think those identifying problems should offer at least one potential solution , but on this issue I fail. I cannot believe that the media suggestion that we just provide transport to Europe is sensible. By providing transport , I mean that European ships just hover around and as soon as the overloaded ships founder we pick folk out of the sea and bring them to Europe. If that why not just arrange to collect them (and perhaps their fees ) in the first place? <br /><br /> Nor do I see that the UN can simply wash its hands and regard this as a local problem.<br /><br /> The population explosion due to hit Africa means that some solution needs to be found. At what level does it provide a real threat to the stability of receiving countries - a half million ? 1 million? 2-3 million?<br /><br /> I am left with the feeling that it is the apparently preventable nature of these deaths and their portrayal in the media which is being used t produce a particular public reaction - the numbers of preventable malaria deaths is far greater but more out of sight.<br /><br /> A subsidiary question is that many of these migrants seem to be highly motivated individuals with skills. Perhaps the very folk that Africa needs most at the moment?<br /><br /> Any suggestions about how to provide a solution?	sken	2015-05-03 19:00:00	0	0
991	224	1	Following on from the boxing debate, this editorial from The BMJ brings up the equally controversial topic of American football and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).<br /><br /> The authors posing this question—a director of sports medicine and a professor of  family medicine from the US—mention that the NFL recently paid  $870m (£578m,  €822m) to former players who claimed their neurological deficits were from playing the sport.<br /><br /> They say that over the past 60 years there have only been 63 autopsy confirmed cases of CTE in American football players, and there is currently no  diagnostic test that can confirm it in living people. However, they conclude that, despite such uncertainties, we urgently need strategies to reduce concussive head impacts in American football.	Sabreena	2015-03-31 19:02:00	2	0
992	224	1	I know you're talking American football here but I read somewhere that some rugby tackles can have the same impact as being involved in a 30mph crash.<br /><br /> This all stems from the evolution of the game 20-25 years ago whenit was on the cusp of going professional. The big players on the pitch used to be the 2nd rows at 6ft 5, 6ft 6. Some positions (scrum half for example) were as small as 5ft 6, wingers were around 5ft 10. This all changed when Jonah Lomu came on the scene in the mid 90s. He was a 6ft 5, 19 stone winger who could run 100m in 11s. The smallest player on a rugby pitch is now around 6ft.  Props are now 6ft 5. The 2nd rows have beefed up too. Richie Gray is 6ft 10, Devin Toner is 6ft 11, Luke Charteris is 6ft 11 and 20 stone.<br /><br /> Everyone is bigger and tackles harder making the head injuries more severe.<br /><br /> Seriously though, how can you realistically reduce concussive head impacts in this or other contact sports without fundamentally changing the game?

996	224	1	Of course you do, Duane, you're a sportsman, but the Olympics,an amateur sport?   Pull the other one!<br /><br /> In all countries, I think, that can afford it, Olympic class sportspeople are paid to pursue their sport, in the National Interest.    For instance, the British Olympic Association set up UK Sport specifically to raise funds and support 'elite' athletes in the years up to 2012, with salaries and facilities and the objective of winning more Olympic medals.   And it worked.  Team GB won SEVENTY TWO per cent more medals than it did in Beijing, at a cost of £4.5 MILLION per medal, over £264 million overall.<br /><br /> I don't know how much America spent, but niether country treated its elite athletes as amateurs.   The justification for this ENORMOUS cost is in the enthusiasm for sport that it raises in sports people, like you and me, and in people who didn't do sport, except watch.  I have to say it's been patchy:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/10200815/What-has-been-London-2012s-legacy-for-the-Olympic-sports-a-year-after-the-Games.html but it's there.<br /><br /> In most sports then, I think that there is an argument for professionalism at the elite level, for National Pride and to encourage participation lower down the sport.   Some sports seem to suffer from it, though.   Soccer has been professional since Adam kicked a bladder, and look at it!   In the UK at least, narcissistic and wildly over paid, from vast ticket prices charged (non-playing) fans and sponsorship deals larger than small countries' GDP.   Rugby may not be there yet, but the question has been asked, is it makking elite rugby players too strong for their own good, by causing each other long term injury?<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-04-07 22:56:00	1	0

999	225	1	I think, Pat, that investigations are at such an early stage, that it's too soon to even think about how the Game might be changed.  we have to know where and when these impacts occur, before that can happen.    It has changed, a lot since we played, principally by going professional and the players , even Internationals, are much fitter, heavier and stronger, if not one wit tougher than we were!   The potential for injury is greater, as the need for the changes in scrum rules has sought to alleviate.<br /><br /> I'd like to see the same investigations in League Rugby, with its rare formal scrums and minimal scrummages, but where astounding tackles are seen that would, in the phrase, fell a bull, but from which the players get up and play on.<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-01-14 22:44:00	0	0
1000	226	1	A recent BBC article discussed the impact of American football on the brain of teenager. Other older studies discussed a condition that happens to fighers in professional boxing named 'Punch-Drunk Syndrome' in addition to various injurious eg broken nose to say the least. In Graeco-Roman & Freestyle Wrestling there is win by injury. Apart from Olympic sports, in Sumo certain dietary regimens are imposed to result in what could be medically called 'obesity'. WWE, and mixed martial arts (MMA) can result in significant injuries.<br /><br /> I understand that virtually any sport can result in injury but there are huge differences between the extents of injury even in combative sports and martial arts. eg<br /><br /> Compare motocross to cycling, the injuries of motocross and other motorcycle races can be fatal, cycling can result in injuries but the frequency is less, the impact is less and certainly not as life threatening as motorcycling. Even in combative sports Boxing injuries can result un much more frequency and intensity of damage (esp. irreversible ones) than Judo.<br /><br /> I wonder should the medical society establish 'danger limits of sports', or sign petition against the practice of certain dangerous/ and hazardous sports akin to smoking labels.

1004	227	1	Magnet therapy, magnetic therapy, or magnotherapy is an alternative medicine practice involving the use of magnetic fields. Practitioners claim that subjecting certain parts of the body to magnetostatic fields produced by permanent magnets has beneficial health effects.These pseudoscientific physical and biological claims are unproven and no effects on health or healing have been established.Although haemoglobin is weakly diamagnetic when oxygenated and paramagnetic when deoxygenated, the magnets used in magnetic therapy are too weak to have any measurable effect on blood flowClaimed benefit :-Greater resistance to infectionIt helps to remove waste products from the blood ie lactic acid calcium and cholesterolIt increases energy and strengthIt helps recovery or can prevent onset of R.S.I. (Repetitive Stress Injury)/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. It alleviates migraine and headaches. There is still much research and debate about magnets work. Different theories have been put forward by manufactures of magnetic products and controversial results !Any openion ?	alaminium	2012-08-28 21:10:00	0	0
1005	227	1	"I am always at doubt when a certain method offers cure for many different disorders.However, some of the alternative therapies have certain effects, be it because of placebo effect and the urge to believe it does work, or for other obscure reasons.Little serous research was done on those methods.We know for instance that acupuncture can help reduce pain and there are also other alternative modalities.In past, there were healers who were collecting certain leaves, mixing them and applying them to wounds or making from them a potion for the sick. Science helped us to realise later that those herbs contain various active chemical substances and we learned how to manufacture those in labs and medications appeared with dosages, etc.If we think along similar lines, let us suppose that the healer using a certain magnet is actuallly like the healer who prepared potions from leaves. The healer has no idea what exactly works, but for some reason it helps certain patients. Now let us take a little dive into the subatomic world of modern quantum physics with the theories of certain energy fields at work, of matter being actually also waves, string theory and membrane theory etc, about the true nature of our reality , and let us suppose that some action actually does something on that level, altering the matter-wave in a certain way as to ""tune"" it differently, and perhaps there is your effect on subatomic level, creating a change on atomic- molecular level.But we simply don't know yet how to manage it, how to achieve the desired effect..Perhaps in the future we will learn how to elicit certain effects that will lead to improvement or cure on those complicated levels.Just as we learned to make the chemical substance from the leaves. Only now we are on the ""leaves"" level with magnetotherapy and other alternative therapies.And perhaps all these really don't work and what we witness is placebo effect. But then how far can we actually boost up a placebo effect?"	yoram chaiter	2012-08-28 22:53:00	0	0
1006	227	1	"Magnetic treatment is of two kinds, local and general, depending on whether          the disease is localized or all-inclusive. The palms or the soles of the          feet are placed on two magnets with different poles and the patient is          exposed to them for 10 minutes a day, preferably in the morning before          breakfast. Chronic cases take half-an-hour a day. The precautions are          cursory: no ingestion of anything cold an hour after treatment, no bathing          for two hours after. Strong magnets should not be applied to pregnant          women and to the heart and the brain.One of the reasons for magnet therapy's growing popularity is that there is          no paucity of therapists and teachers.A magnet can also be used without looking like an awkward prosthesis—a          hearing aid, or worse still, a crutch. You can go jogging wearing a magnetic          headband (""improve your memory on the run""); you can grace parties wearing          magnetic necklaces made of silver and gunmetal in India, and gold in Australia—these          chokers treat bronchitis and protect against an asthmatic attack. Magnetic          earrings and pendants guard against an under-active thyroid. Magnetic          goggles are handsome add-ons that double as cures for conjunctivitis and          glaucoma, and help reduce visual defects. If you are a pretty spinster          and insistent suitors are raising your BP, a magnetic ring will work like          magic-ridding you of both. And magnets as gifts allow you to be idiosyncratic          without being over-the-top. There is, of course, a catch to magnet therapy: outside of orthopedics,          it is an unpredictable, sporadic success. It is still a system of the          last resort: its patients are most often refugees from other therapies. Often chronic cases come to us after having          tried all other systems and expect quick relief. What is also missing is rigor and research. Practitioners lack a scientific system of analysis. We don't document          our cases, which is absolutely necessary for research. So what is missing from this therapy is not magnetic appeal but the kind          of scientific zealotry that attracts both funding and practitioners. For          only then will it succeed in breaking the stranglehold of modern pill          popping and needle-jabbing medicine."	Dr. K. Ashutosh	2012-08-29 18:06:00	0	0

I was on 5 medications, proton pump inhibitors, xanax, valium, etc. I was a mess. I went on vacation to Yellowstone and there was a magnetic jeweler there. I bought a couple of bracelets because I liked the looks and design and figured it couldnt hurt. Shortly after, I began feeling better. I stopped the meds that they were giving me and didn't have problems with stress or anxiety like I was having.  I am not saying that it stopped instantaniously. I still had problems, but they were greatly reduced. I started purchasing other magnetic products, such as a magnetic knee brace. It was a total life saver. I have degenerative arthritis in my knees and when they flaired up, I could barely walk, even with normal braces on. The magnetic brace helped to relieve the pain within 20 minutes, and greatly reduced the length between flair ups.  I now swear by them!<br /><br /> Mel<br /><br /> Melsmagnetictherapy.com	melon007	2014-07-12 00:54:00	0	0

It would be futile to suggest an ""NHS"" in world sport, when so many countries have no state health mechanism.  But the money is there to employ sports specialists and WADA should take hold of that.Any team that wishes to employ a sports doctor should be obliged to pay their salary and employment costs into a WADA held Trust.  At the same time, WADA should set up an independent certification Board to oversee the qualification and conduct of sports specialists, in international sport.  The Trust would employ the doctor, and the Board certify their conduct.Clearly there are plenty of international funding bodies in sport whose morals and standards leave much to be desired. FIFA (football), the IOC in the past, the many boxing bodies and of course the ICU (cycling) have been as blind as Nelson to blatant misdeeds, but WADA is an organisation set up specifically to prevent crime, and I hope that it would be able to resist internal corruption.John"	John D	2013-02-16 09:57:00	0	0

Only they could save themselves.    Surely they will make a film of this?<br /><br /> After nearly 24 hours, the Base engineers eventually were able to rig a jury repair, without which all scientific work at the Base would have stopped and the crew reduced to living in the garage, where a small independent heater kept the vehicles from freezing.     Our gallant cook devised ways of making meals on expedition camp stoves as after warmth, hot food was the next requirement.  His understated account is in the finest British tradition of chin up and make do!<br /><br /> I had never heard of this dramatic story!  It did appear in the news at the time, and escaped me, but it cannot have received the attention it deserved, perhaps because of that finest British tradition, that minimises the best and worst that life can throw.       I think anyone could enjoy this edition of the Food Programme, without any interest in food, Antarctica or science!<br /><br />   You can hear it at  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075mhgr<br /><br />  <br /><br /> John	John D	2016-04-03 14:41:00	0	0
1028	234	1	Nepalese Diploma in Mountain Medicine is a post graduate course proposed to be run by the Mountain Medicine Society of Nepal (MMSN). This course is approved by the Union Internationale des Associations d’Alpinisime(UIAA) , International Society of Mountain Medicine (ISMM) and International Commission for Alpine Rescue(IKAR).In Oct-Nov 2010, a feasibility study for the Diploma was done in Kathmandu and the Khumbu region of Nepal with support from the Medex. Potential sites were visited in person and a report was presented to the local and international stakeholders. Following this, a straight 4 weeks curriculum was developed.The course will start on November 9th, 2011 and last until December 8th, 2011. The first week of the course will be organized in Kathmandu and the rest three weeks in Thame valley of the Everest region. We are now accepting application for the course.Besides the theoretical part, the diploma encompasses practical hands on skills on rope techniques, surviving skills, rescue techniques, practical traumatology and practical advice from the international instructors. Qualified instructors and mountain guides deliver the course in English.The main aim of this course is to train Nepalese doctors in the home country with syllabus tailored to suit the local needs without compromising international standards.The Nepalese Diploma is supported by the Medical Expeditions, Swiss Mountain Society, Alpine Club-UK, Porters Progress UK and many other individuals and organizations.Linkhttp://mmsn.org.np/dimm/ Disclaimer: I'm associated with Mountain Medicine Society of Nepal and the content was taken from the society's website.

1034	235	1	In my UK hospital, we recently had a presentation from a representative of Mercy Ships:http://www.mercyships.org.uk/get-involvedThis followed one of my own colleagues serving on one of their projects, and I intend to look at doing this myself.Mercy Ships is an American Christian organisation, but then it's nigh impossible to find an organisation doing this sort of thing that does not have a religious ethos.  Good for them and shame on us atheists!Medecins Sans Frontiers are an irreligious medical outfit, but their ethos is to go where the strife is worst and the risk is greatest, and they demand langauges AND experience in the provison of Third World aid.  Too much for a soon-to-be retiring doctor, like me and you, Drs.Doc and Valenta!I have volunteered for the 2012 Olympics! The main effort has been to recruit 'ordinary' people to work for the Games, and the window in which volunteers could put themselves forward has now closed, but I'm sure that the Games organisers will be glad to hear from doctors who want help.   See: http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/london-2012-games-makers/index.php  But don't expect to get a front row seat at the 100m final!Lastly, and in following my own interest, would you like to become a Motorsport doctor?   I'd be glad to talk to any doctor who is interested in getting closer to the action at rallies, circuit racing and other forms of motorsport.  You do get paid, though not much!John	John D	2012-10-12 15:23:00	0	0

1036	235	1	Hello all,my name is Dr Ronan Flynn a GP trainee in the west of Ireland. Myself and some colleagues set up a primary care clinic in a township outside lusaka in Zambia Southern Africa. The facility serves an ever growing population of over 30,000 people. There is one doctor one nurse a physiotherapist and a social worker. We often take volunteer health professionals and have had a UK based GP work with us in the recent past. We don't require any specialist training in Tropical medicine as we already have a Zambian doctor and frequently it is the common illnesses we see here that cause significant problems over there. Your experience would be a valued commodity!We would be very interested in talking to anyone who would like to volunteer.

1050	238	1	Hi NinjaSan,Thanks for the query here. I would like to apologize that this query seemed unnoticed  - longer than we usually respond here.Yes you can suggest Acetazolamide to her for Kilimanjaro. Kilimanjoro hike is really rapid and too high as per the schedules/stations I was given by one of the visiters a couple of years ago.However, please, make sure she is not allergic to Sulfonamide moiety containing drugs (sulfa drugs) and her kidney is fine. She should not be diabetic to go altitude and take diamox.I have not read any adverse or aggravating condition with hypermobility and diamox...worth exploring.Increasing urinary out, tingling, numbness, flat taste esp cola drinks should be mentioned. Almost all get this.You could advise either 500mg two divided doses daily starting one day prior ascent (night before) or 250mg two divided doses as earlier can help. --- or there might other regimen which you can look into. http://accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aid=9151473I hope this helps.matiPS: I'm not GP but worked as clinician at altitude.

1063	239	1	Everest deaths - body recovery a difficult and dangerous endeavour!! Of course - BUT - where has compassion gone from these people? There should be some way of providing teams to recover bodies funded by a levy on the climbers themselves - if one has paid £25000 as recently reported to join a large group, then perhaps a levy of £5000 each paid to the authiorites, not the tour operators, could be appropriate.	jdbaines	2013-05-23 15:52:00	0	0

1065	240	1	The prevention and treatment of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is waranted when one has to ascend quickly or somebody who is at the risk of it while enjoying mountains (hiking/trekking/climbing/pilgrimmage etc.). The well tested and tried drug for it is: Diamox (Acetazolamide)!!! There have been numerous studies (RCTs) and the drug is in use for multiple other conditions (e.g. glaucoma or as a diuretic).The meta-analysis in 2000 by Dumont et al published in BMJ caused much of controversy than giving a solution. Many field researchers, clinicians and reputed high altitude medicine experts expressed their views in it. Dumont et al, BMJ, 2000: [http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7256/267]Responses: http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7256/267?tab=responsesThe analysis rather came into a controversial conclusion with larger dose of Acetazolamide and even doubting the effecacy of it in prevention AMS. The analysis could have been skewed with the study selection (inclusion/exclusion) criteria!This year: 2012; we by now see four big meta-analyses on this topic (which is great):1. Seaupaul et al, AEM, 2012: http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(11)01700-8/abstract 2. Kayser et al, HAMB, 2012: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ham.2011.10843. Ritchie et al, JTM, 2012: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1708-8305.2012.00629.x/abstractand finally in BMJ4. Low et al, BMJ, 2012: http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6779xxxThe second review this year in a high altitude specific journal is by the assciated group who reviewed in 2000 in BMJ (Dumont et al) and they come with similar conclusion. This is strange that the journal that has been dedicated to altiude biology and medicine could not get better, rigorous and updated reviews. First (Seaupaul et al, AEM, 2012) and third (Ritchie et al, JTM, 2012) one have been published in general clinical journals and fairly well covered. I would say, the authors have done great job. It is good that they have been in the journals that clinicians will read and practice. I think we are pretty much done with these kind of meta-analyses for few years to come unless we see flurry of new trials coming up in next couple of years. The message is out there: loud and clear!The final and recent one in BMJ (Low et al, BMJ, 2012) is taking the topic a bit further ahead. I think they have simply ignored to the controversies (especially if it is effective?) and gone to look into Acetazolamide dosages (and by looking into it, they would also answer about that unprecedented large dose recommendation). This will put a final nail in the coffin of debate whether Acetazolamide is effictive to prevent AMS and if we need that high dosage. It is good that it has been in a pretty reputed journal like BMJ and we will take it.  I think BMJ had to do this especially when they had published the first controversial one and the debate was ongoing. The conclusive step ....we will see ! The strength of review is further consolidated with the association some of the authors who are actually renowned altitude experts. Future work or questions will be about uses of this lowest dosage in rapid ascents as concluded here by Low et al. Rapid ascent is the condition where we need it more. I would be happier if future works are directed in investigating new preventive and therapeutic drugs in altitude illness along with Diamox. Due to its (Diamox's) Sulfa moeity (can't be used by those who have sulfa allergy) and other side effects, we will need to explore options/alternatives to it.Abstract of BMJ meta-analysis:======================AbstractObjectives To assess the efficacy of three different daily doses of acetazolamide in the prevention of acute mountain sickness and to determine the lowest effective dose.Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.Data sources Medline and Embase along with a hand search of selected bibliographies. No language restrictions were applied.Study selection Randomised controlled trials assessing the use of acetazolamide at 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg daily versus placebo in adults as a drug intervention for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness. Included studies were required to state the administered dose of acetazolamide and to randomise participants before ascent to either acetazolamide or placebo. Two reviewers independently carried out the selection process.Data extraction Two reviewers extracted data concerning study methods, pharmacological intervention with acetazolamide, method of assessment of acute mountain sickness, and event rates in both control and intervention groups, which were verified and analysed by the review team collaboratively.Data synthesis 11 studies (with 12 interventions arms) were included in the review. Acetazolamide at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg were all effective in preventing acute mountain sickness above 3000 m, with a combined odds ratio of 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.46). At a dose of 250 mg daily the number needed to treat for acetazolamide to prevent acute mountain sickness was 6 (95% confidence interval 5 to 11). Heterogeneity ranged from I2=0% (500 mg subgroup) to I2=44% (750 mg subgroup).Conclusions Acetazolamide in doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily are all more effective than placebo for preventing acute mountain sickness. Acetazolamide 250 mg daily is the lowest effective dose to prevent acute mountain sickness for which evidence is available. ======================	Matiram Pun	2012-10-19 01:36:00	0	0

1072	240	1	Hi Carolin,We were focussed about Prevention/Prophylaxis here. But confusion arises because Acetazolamide is effective in both treatment and prevention.Hence, it is trekker/climber's or his/her physician's call to wait for the symptoms and go for the treatment OR use prophylactically! Usally, a day before (night before) you start ascending would be better time to start for prophylaxis.Yes, cases are plenty when you are up and above of 3500m altitude.

1075	242	1	Hello all,First a caveat - I'm not a clinician - I work for BMJ in a technical capacity and have just returned from Nepal where I was doing some walking and climbing. Below is an account of an incident I was involved in. I'd appreciate opinions on what we might do differently in future, and any lessons it might have for others.We were walking the Annapurna circuit, and my group of four friends had fallen in with a few other groups of trekkers, so that there were nine in the group. One of these had hired a guide. Otherwise, we were all trekking without guides or porters. On 5th January we were walking from Yak Kharka to Thorung Phedi, at roughly 4800m. A young man (28 years old??) who was part of the group stumbled on an eroded section of path at 3pm, and fell approx 30m down a steep (60 degree?) section of gravel/scree slope. He came to rest in sight, and appeared unconscious. One person remaining on the path, reported some movement after about 5 minutes.I climbed down to him, which took me around 20 minutes. He was lying head downward on his right side. He had one open skull fracture of about 3 inches on the top right of his head, which I covered with a glove and applied pressure. I put my down jacket on him, and asked him to blink if he could hear me. This he did, but I could not get a verbal response or any movement from him. I continued to talk to him, cut his rucksack off, and tried to move him gently to a head up position, but couldn't - he was too heavy, and I didn't want to let go of his head. I carefully inspected his head, and found further large skull fractures on the top and back of his head. I tried to cover these and applied pressure. Unable to do much else, I waited for about 15 minutes, at which point four Nepalis from Thorung Phedi arrived.They immediately lifted him and carried him rapidly down the last part of the slope to the flat river bed and set him down. I then asked them to retrieve his rucksack, remove as much clothing/sleeping bag etc as possible and put it on and under him. I again inspected his head more carefully, and found further injuries, maybe 4 large open fractures in total, one separate, the others joining to the pressumed impact point at the back/top of his head. I removed my hat and tried to cover all of them with my hand. Bleeding was continuing, but not massively - I was more worried about hypothermia than blood loss at this point. (Later, in hospital they gave him 2 units of blood)After an hour, he started to move his left leg in sporadic bicycle kick movements, and make groaning noises. He never moved his right side at all, and I assumed it was paralysed. Breathing seemed fine, and he started to move his head occasionally. At 4pm the valley came into shadow, and the temperature dropped rapidly. I noticed that his skull was easily depressed, and when he moved the bleeding tended to restart. I was concerned about not pressing his skull into his brain, but also wanted to stop the bleeding. He vomitted once at about 4.00pm, and I didn't see any signs of blood. I cleared his airway. During this time I tried to keep talking to him, and reassuring him. Two members of our group arrived with more down clothing at 4.30pm. At 5.15pm, more Nepalis arrived from High Camp (above Thorung Phedi) with material for a stretcher. It was essentially dark by the time we got him on to it. I attempted to fix my hat and gloves over his head wounds with duct tape and some bandages for the stretcher journey.Carrying him up to Thorung Phedi was very hard, and would have been almost impossible without the assistance of the locals who were many times stronger than any of us. Even so, they had to rest 2-3 times on the way. He vomitted again while we were carrying him.There was no power at Thorung Phedi, and the temperature dropped to -15c that night. We put him in a room and all 9 of us say with him through the night. Our body heat was a very effective heater, and the room remained (slightly) above 0c all night. By now, he could answer yes/no questions, but continued kicking movements with his left leg, and some uncontrolled left arm movements. We checked pulse and temperature hourly. Pulse constant at 122 per minute, and temperature roughly constant around 36.0c.We got him to swallow, and gave him water via a sponge into his mouth. At first he swallowed about 300ml in 2-3 hours but vomitted it up again. We reduced the rate, and got him to retain about 250ml over the course of the night. I removed the hat/glove bandage and applied iodine soaked gauze, which we took turns holding in place by hand - he found pressure painful, and bleeding had pretty much stopped by now. And it helped keep us awake! We changed bandages maybe once or twice more over the night.We had some oral painkiller - possibly tramadol, but it was a German brand name if so (lent by another trekker). We applied the maximum dose (30 drops every 6 hours, something like that), which appeared to have only slight effect, but the patient asked for more, so it must have done something!We kept him away and answering questions all night. As his alertness slowly improved, so did his apparent discomfort. He often contradicted himself with the yes/no answers, so it was hard to find out the areas of pain/discomfort. We had reached a telephon in Ledar (below us) at around 4.00pm, and were promised a helicopter at 6.30 am the next day - first light. In the end, the chopper arrived at 9.45am - a very frustrating wait, with a fear it might not come at all for some reason!We again stretchered him to to landing zone and loaded him on. This time I found a triangular banadage and did a slightly better job of fixing his dressings to his head! Two young American women he had been travelling in also went into the chopper to help with arrangements at the other end.Result---------He reached Kathmandu on the 6th, and his mother in Canada was contacted 2hrs later. She agreed to immediate surgery. Fragments of bone had entered his brain. These were removed, and his skull stapled (48 staples, I think he told me!). Amazingly, no other injuries beyong a large bruise over his eye, and small cuts.I saw the patient on 14th Jan. He was still paralysed on the right hand side, and seemed to have quite bad pain for an unknown reason in his left shoulder. He could form short sentences, but still had speech problems. He was cheerful, laughed at our cruel jokes, and seemed to be doing pretty well, considering. Apparently CAT scans showed some dead brain tissue, but that's 3rd hand information, so should be taken with caution.My thoughts:a) I probably should have paid more attention to cleaning the wound. I don't know why I didn't think to make an iodine solution and wash it.b) At 3pm it was warm and sunny. I wasn't expecting to be there holding his head for 2.5hrs. I should have taken my own sleeping bag, and a head torch. (We ended up stretchering him in the dark, with only one or two torches between all of us available)c) Put more proper wound dressings in my first aid kit (I only had one). The gauze bandages stick to the wound, and the material caught caught up in bone framents. Messy.Any thoughts or questions very welcome. The doctors in Kathmandu were somewhat surprised he survived the night!P.S. His medical insurance was excellent, they never queried any cost, and have also paid out for much greater nursing care than is standard in the hospital.	Jon Peterson	2013-01-16 13:59:00	0	0
1076	242	1	Dear Jon,I think you did an amazing job !!!Probably it wouldn´t have been a good idea to put iodine on an open skull fracture. Sometimes less is more.I hope your friend makes a full recovery!!	Carolin	2013-01-16 14:24:00	0	0
1077	242	1	"I completely agree with Carolin!That he is alive and has at least one side of his body working is a tribute to your care!   It is very easy to criticise, so please take my comments in the spirit of admiring attempts to fine tune your performance.A is for Airway.  In someone with severly impaired conciousness after a fall, the first care should be to ensure that their breathing is unobstructed.  You may have been able to see this and pass it by.   The next in the aidememoire is B for Breathing - are they, by themselves? - and C for Circulation.  You can add D for Disability, which you immediately noted and E for Exposure, to ensure that all injuries are known, a step too far in the situation you found him in, but appropriate later.In such a fall, we must expect neck and spinal cord injury.    You did the right thing by supporting and holding his head still, but I would have left him in the prone position, airway allowing, until help arrived.   Only then and perhaps before moving him off the ledge would it be possible to place a neck immobilising collar on him.Injury further down the spine is equally possible in such a fall.    ""Log turning"" - turning the patient in such a way that the spine is not twisted - needs at least six people, maybe impossible on the ledge, but will safeguard the spinal cord from further injury.   And immobilisation of the spine, during transport.  Gosh, I don't know how you could have improvised a spinal stretcher.  I know that Nepal has little in the way of trees, so lashing him to a stretcher of branches probably wasn't an option.I'm beginning to feel awful now!   Here I am advocating ideal, western world management when you were half way up a Himalaya!   You did fine!You will almost certainly never be called upon to repeat your feat!  But to deal with the injuries that are more likely to come your way, you may want to equip yourself with a few items of equipment, that should be light and small, for inclusion in your pack. I would suggest:Melolin dressings - they don't stick to the wound.A SAM splint - a roll of foam covered aluminium sheet, that when unrolled, formed around a broken limb and bandaged on, makes an excellent splint.   Can also be used as a neck collar, or cut with scissors to make smaller, say finger, splints.Chitosan dressings or powder.   The standard treatment for severe bleeding is, as you did, pressure, but this can be used with pressure to promote the formation of a sealing blood clot that makes transport easier.    I think, but am not sure, that it is safe to use on an open head injury.   I'd couple that with a CAT (Combat Application Tourniquet), that can be applied with one hand (it might be you!) to allow temporary control of severe bleeding while other treatments are started.Further, I suggest that your exploit deserves publication in the BMJ, where it might be accompanied by a discussion of the problem of head and spinal injury at altitude from a more qualified pre-hospital care practitioner than I, or a medical mountaineer.Altogether, well done!John"	John D	2013-01-16 19:04:00	0	0
1078	242	1	Jon, I am no clinician but as Caroline and John said you did a fabulous job in a very difficult situation with no Trauma training.

1079	242	1	Hi Jon Peterson,First of all, thank you for visiting Nepal and hiking in Nepal Himalayas. I hope you had wonderful time (except this event). Secondly, you have done great job and excellent impromptu skills to save life a fellow trekker. This is unfortunate accident to have at that altitude. Great inputs from Carolin, John and Kirked... I agree.At 3 PM, the trekking in Nepal Himalayas to that altitude; I would imagine you had already trekked/walked 2/3rd of your time/distance and still have rest to complete i.e. last one third of the day is always challenging to higher altitudes. At the very same time, you have chosen to go to Thorang Phedi instead of moving down (i.e. you were in upper setment). Hence, you all must have been tired and gaining more altitudes over the days.Then about 'what you should have done' in your last segment is always there. On top of that, you are not a practicing physician (Emergency). Even if we are, there will be always room for the 'best decision at the moment with available resources'. Hence, you have done great with such an effort. Thank you for the detailed account here and it is classic traumatic brain injury - all history you have given. I am very happy that the person survived.I assume you had crossed the river and were walking along the side of right while going up. There are all loose rocks and soil ....which seem constantly moving. It makes even worse as Yaks do graze higher up, mountain goats roam around and sometimes snow leopards hunt those mountain goats high up making them to run and rush....they all aggravate movement of rocks and soil in that long steep side. It is dangerous area to pass through.In 2008, I was in Thorang Phedi (making it a satellite clinic) for about three weeks while I was working at HRA Manang Aid Post. I can understand the difficulty, the challenge and frustration you got during all these rescue operations. It is really difficult due to altitude, terrain, temperature and lacking communication means! Yes, I do aggree with you about removing obvious foreign bodies (which are on the surface) from the wound. Yes, you are right about cleaning with betadine (diluting with boiled water when you reached Phedi). While at the very time, you might have been fine because not doing so, you mobilized wound less especially when there was depressed skull fractures (large and open!). What could have been better if it was cleaned, you could apply clean and betadine gauge to stop bleeding and not to change that ofen (unless it bleeds more and soaks gauge completely). Great job Jon...massive humanitarian work! I can understand the frantic search for medication and burrowing medication (with German script). Glad that you found some. Yes, that's important to alleviate pain and at the very same time if there were some NSAIDS - cyclooxygenase inhibitors (which are available even over the counter e.g. Ibuprofen) and used in high altitude headaches; that might be helpful as well. Indomethacin (another NSAIDs) of this group reduces cerebral blood flow .... acute brain swelling with altitude hypoxia (AMS pathology) is thought to happen and Indomethacin is also used to in raised intracranial pressures....the drug easily available and used quite extensively ...likely to be found around as well. I am putting here as a discussion if available ...Vomiting episodes that we would not have wished for...luckily it did not get worse. I am thinking it did happen because of physical reasons (i.e. steep terrain, loose rocks and soil, narrow trail, fatigue...) rather than any altitude illness. Trekkers who go Annupurna circuit slowly gain altitude by its nature of terrain although that starts rise quickly from Yak Kharka...last a couple of days! The treks from Yak Kharka-Thorang Phedi and Phedi-onwards....I think trekkeers should start early (around 8-9 AM) in the morning. The late it gets, difficult it becomes...wind, cold and then there is altitude gain. Hence, one gets pressed which is not get...as you can't take enough breaks! The segment on the right side up after crossing river to Thorang Phedi is difficult due to all those topography. One should really carefully pass through.I hope the person is doing better....Once again, great work and thank you for sharing.....Wishes,mati	Matiram Pun	2013-01-19 01:27:00	0	0

1081	242	1	Hello john,   In spite of many adverse circumstances at high altitude, and theoretical discussions apart, you have provided the best medical aid, and it’s encouraging to learn that your group colleague is recovering. You deserve a pat on your back.  Just one clarification: do helmets are an essential part of the montenering kit?  And can one have it worn during high altitude climbing where hypoxic conditions exist. Do they come in the delivery of oxygen supply circuits that are connected to the individuals while climbing high altitudes? Or, any modifications in helmets can be devised to minimize accidental head trauma as happened in this case?	csm@csm	2013-03-10 17:50:00	0	0

JohnPosted by John DAgreed respected John! But here is an important tip from the basic physics- How to look at the photographs' Every photograph is, however black and white it may be, is 3-D in nature. But our human eyes being stereoscopic, are not able to see the inbuilt depth, the third dimension in it. The reason why the birds can fly with ease is that they lack the stereoscopic vision and have 'monoscopic' vision. If the birds would have a stereoscopic vision, they might not be able to fly, due to perception of the depth. To unmask the hidden depth or the third dimension in the photographs (actually 3D images), simply close one eye, so that the apparent two dimensional image would then appear a 3-D image! Look at the upscaled image by me with one eye closed and you will be aware of the depth, the third dimension and the beauty.	Dr. K. Ashutosh	2012-12-23 14:38:00	0	0

1092	244	1	"The bar-headed geese have been enigmatic for the physiologists and biologists as they fly over Himalayas where there is barely minimal oxygen to sustain life for the human beings.

Such a mismatch is paradoxical, and it  is not clear why geese might fly higher than is absolutely necessary. In                      addition, direct empirical measurements of  high-altitude flight are lacking. We test whether migrating bar-headed  geese actually                      minimize flight altitude and make use of favourable  winds to reduce flight costs. By tracking 91 geese, we show that these                      birds typically travel through the valleys of the  Himalayas and not over the summits. We report maximum flight altitudes  of                      7290 m and 6540 m for southbound and northbound  geese, respectively, but with 95 per cent of locations received from  less                      than 5489 m. Geese travelled along a route that was  112 km longer than the great circle (shortest distance) route, with  transit                      ground speeds suggesting that they rarely profited  from tailwinds. Bar-headed geese from these eastern populations  generally                      travel only as high as the terrain beneath them  dictates and rarely in profitable winds. Nevertheless, their migration  represents                      an enormous challenge in conditions where humans  and other mammals are only able to operate at levels well below their  sea-level                      maxima.                   ============================I believe this as I have seen these geese taking breaks in inner valleys of Nepal!"

1104	247	1	Back in the 19th and early 20 century, doctors were used to write case reports, with long entires but apparently they had very good time to meet with patients. Nowadays, the modern doctor has to document every single intervention that is done, in case notes, eportfolio, logbook and have patients and colleagues feedback, in addition to medico-legal documentation. I wonder how much time is spent for documentation. I wonder if the modern doctor is spending more time documenting that practicing?	Sidhom	2015-09-05 21:10:00	0	0

His 'pathographies' were so compelling, the 'who' with the 'what' suffused with humanity and a writing style which could convey very complex neurological physiology and pathophysiology yet maintain the simplicity of the message.<br /><br /> Sacks books (Island of the Colour Blind, Awakenings, The Man who mistook his wife for a hat and many others) had a profound influence upon me. As a medical lay man I thoroughly enjoyed his pathographies and his ability to empathise which I have never known another medical man be able to seem to do so well. Initially some medics thought he was using his neurological patients for his own literary voyeurism but I don't think that charge sticks if one really reads his body of work. The encephalitis lethargica patients brought to life in New York with L-dopa made him consider very starkly and with guilt whether he had bitten of more than he could chew or given the patients an unfair insight into another world which was not within his gift (or modern medicines' ) to bestow.<br /><br /> Does anyone else enjoy his writing?

1107	247	1	"I suspect that what happens more nowadays is that notes etc... are written at the time the patient has been seen. This has been an issue for at least as long as the NHS has been around. Do I write up the OP notes and dictate a letter or do I see another patient? Various attempts have been made to try to overcome the problem.  As the medico-legal aspects have come increasingly to the fore , so the obligation to complete the paperwork on the patient in front of you has come to override the obligation to the patient not yet seen. This is compouded by the need for a good paper trail for audit etc...<br /><br /> A second major area is the reviewing of results - where I worked these came back to the desk for comment  and many required a letter . Evening work.<br /><br /> A bigger , poorly recognised problem is that many management , organisational aspects of work have to be carried out during normal working hours , so it is the clinical work - seeing referrals or relatives , ward rounds etc... which might need to be carried out by evening/night. My impression is that time is now better allocated for these and the clinical work lighter but that the relatively non-clinical aspects have escalated. When on-take as a junior there often really was not always time to write up notes adequately before the patient went home - working a 1;2 rota the night ""off"" could be spent in trying to catch up but never realy winning. For those coming into medicine - one word of advice : don't expect it to get any better as you move up the hierarchy and for GPs it seems to have got steadily worse. <br /><br /> And of course there were always well-organised folk who managed a 9-5 type of life...."	sken	2015-09-06 14:18:00	0	0

Sabreena	2015-04-23 05:16:00	0	0
1111	248	1	"You can watch this debate again here (go to F1: The big debate)<br /><br /> Here is a summary of the arguments:<br /><br />For<br /><br /><br />  A patient quote: ""I am the only one is consistently there. I am the only one who knows the whole story.""<br /><br />  JS Mill quote: ""Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.""<br /><br />  The responsibility of making all the decisions and the liability for the outcomes of those decisions is worrying for doctors.<br /><br />  This is about competent patients.<br /><br />  If you agree with your rights as an individual you will agree with this motion.<br /><br />  Through initiatives like open access and Patients Included patients can now work with a lot of the same information/data that researchers and specialists do.<br /><br />  The patient as a network of care givers and other advocates in the community is in a better position than one doctor ever could be.<br /><br />  To keep on top of all the primary care literature a GP would have to spend 18 hours a day reading.<br /><br />  A doctor sees a patient for 1-2 hours a year. The patients and care givers self care for the other 8764 hours.<br /><br />  Patients are the ones who know how to live well with their diseases; they are able to prioritise the outcomes that matter to them; they are the ones who know how to make decisions in time frames appropriate to them.<br /><br />  The imbalance between doctor and patient is changing.<br /><br />  Co-production is an opportunity to work with patients in order to develop things in a new way.<br /><br />  From patients we can learn about things that clinicians never reailsed were important.<br /><br />  Biomed central has just produced the first journal based entirely around co-production with professional and patient coordinators.<br /><br />  Don't think of patients as a burden, think of them as a resource we need to harness.<br /><br />  It is the ageing population and people with diabetes, cancer, mental health that come to mind when thinking about this motion.<br /><br />  Doctors do not just provide healthcare, they manage healthcare which is a long term process where the patient can be brought in to know best.<br /><br />  Well informed patients with capacity who are stakeholders of their own health would not make decisions that would impact negatively.<br /><br />  Richard smith, ex-editor of The BMJ, is chairman of Patients Know Best.<br /><br />  Why not recruit patients onto your team? By empowering them you can work together for better results that cannot be achieved alone.<br /><br />  Self care is already part of many plans - eg diabetes. Why not increase this?<br /><br /><br />Against<br /><br /><br />  No one person knows best, it is about balance.<br /><br />  Patients know ""different"" but not ""best"".<br /><br />  The current power and knowledge imbalance prevents patients from knowing best.<br /><br />   Patients seek listening, understanding, and caring, not a win-lose ""I know best.""<br /><br />  There is no published literature saying the patient view is the singular correct one.<br /><br />  Being informed is not the same as being responsible; patients and families should not be in the position of being entirely responsible for their care. Shared decision making is the better way.<br /><br />  Don Berwick's ""My right knee"" speech is about the impact of recurrent patellar dislocation, multiple cartilage tears/repairs, and subsequent osteoarthritis on his trekking, his playing with his children, and his keeping fit.<br /><br />  Patients know what is important to them but may not know everything.<br /><br />  Science in medicine is complex. Think Dr House - the wonderful brain that instantly recognises the 24 causes of erythema nodosum, or the rare complication of the over the counter cold remedy that leads to brain inflammation and death. We can't expect every patient to have this level or range of knowledge. If we did. we wouldn't be necessary.<br /><br />  This is not limited to medicine. Do you really understand the heating engineer when he tells you that you need a new boiler?<br /><br />  When patients are ill they want relationships with their doctors. <br /><br />  Doctors know more about the side effects of drugs than patients; patients know more about which side effects they don't want. Eg a swimmer doesn't want weight gain<br /><br />  If rushed to hospital in an ambulance, ""Don't ask me what's best, just save my bloody life.""<br /><br />  In general, patients are excluded from knowing everything.<br /><br />  Patients don't want to know what is best, they want to work with doctors for what is best.<br /><br />  Identifying anyone as knowing best is counterproductive to working as a team.<br /><br />  Giving too much power to one person sets up rivalry.<br /><br />  Look at the example of Ashya King. Irrespective of which side you think is right, there should have been a push to harmonising the views between healthcare professionals and the patient/parents to look at all perspectives/scenarios and calculate what was best for the patient.<br /><br />  Don't vilify one side for not knowing best. <br /><br />  The external social factors that patients bring are important but they are not the only matter of importance.<br /><br />  Currently there is miscommunication and patients have a lack of working knowledge of systems so healthcare opinion is necessary."

1112	248	1	"Sabreena - I think some of us will find your approach curious. Clealy some of this is a generational thing with the new thrust of care towards groups and populations not individuals. Does the patient know best ? Some do , some don't . Do doctors know best ? Some do , some don't - but all are encouraged to follow policies which may well not be in the best interests (as perceived by the patient ) of the individual concerned. Many of those points raised in the ""Against"" column suggestion that we really have moved back to a time of justifying paternalism not far removed from 50 years ago - it is just a different type of paternalism and more dangerous for being pseudo-scientific based on asking the wrong questions...."	sken	2015-04-30 10:40:00	0	0
1113	248	1	Sabreena<br /><br /> I have to admit I’m another one who thinks there are a few curious aspects to this question and indeed the international forum that debated it.<br /><br /> In the way it’s asked the question is surely unanswerable.  The words angels, dancing and heads of pins come to mind.  I can see that the question might be one for a student debate but does it really justify the time and expense of an international event which doesn’t seem likely to lead to anything tangible.<br /><br /> I can’t help wondering if there’s a hidden hand behind all this.  These conferences cost a great deal of money and I just wonder where it comes from.  The Institute for Healthcare Improvements’ website is a little vague on its sources of funding.  Could all that money not be better spent on other things?  If the answer to the ill-defined question was ‘yes’ I suppose, however, it could have dramatic implications (in either direction) for funding the Health Service!<br /><br /> COI:  I’ve read the opposing arguments above but couldn’t justify spending the time watching the debate.	Maxim	2015-04-30 19:35:00	0	0
1114	248	1	Sorry to appear cynical but this debate by the International Forum  seems a bit pointless to me and probably a waste of money. Does the patient know best? Almost certainly not, hence they consult a Doctor.  Would it not be essentially obvious that the Doctor and patient cooperate together to try and do what is best for the patient.  A patient might be thoroughly unrealistic about treatment, its chances of success or what they believe treatment should be. The Doctor is the expert in medicine and the patient the expert about themself - together they have the best chance of overcoming whatever health problem they face.<br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2015-05-01 18:58:00	0	0
1115	248	1	Sabreena<br /><br /> This might just reflect my lack of skill, but I couldn't access this debate without having to commit a worrying amount of time watching the forum in general.  Could you please tell us the result of the debate?  You've seen the results of the poll, albeit with a fairly small sample, and I wonder how this compared with the debate itself.  I wonder also about your own thoughts on the question itself and what it actually means.<br /><br /> I suppose it's no accident that the wording is aligned with the name of particular organisation linked to a previous BMJ editor.  Whilst there's no inherent problem with this, the forum was a vast event with the backing of some very large corporations and there must surely be a larger agenda than simply to debate such a gnomic question.<br /><br /> Given the scale of the event and its potential ramifications, are we going to see it fully reported by the BMJ (its co-sponsor) or does it remain restricted to the blogosphere?

1116	248	1	"Hello all<br /><br />Pre-debate audience vote: ""For"" won with ~60% of votes.<br /><br />Post-debate audience vote: ""Against"" won. They didn't mention the ratio but from the screenshot of the audience I would say it was 70-80%.<br /><br />Obviously the word ""best"" was contentious and was the core of many of the against speakers' opinions but would a less provocative motion have stimulated as much discussion at the Forum and away from it?  For anyone who was there/watched the video it seems clear that the outcome of the debate was less about which side won and more about both sides’ insistence that better collaborative doctor-patient relationships are required."

1117	248	1	Sabreena<br /><br /> Many thanks for that information.  It wasn't the word 'best' that I found odd, more the completely undefined nature of the question.  The swing from 60% for the motion pre-debate to, possibly, 70-80% against post debate might be something of a debating record.  Shame that so many people had to travel expensively across the world to find they agreed with each other about the need for better collaboration but perhaps 60% hadn't realised that before.

1118	248	1	I chaired this very well-attended session at the Forum. It is in the nature of a formal debate that the terms of the argument are put starkly. This facilitates rapid exploration of the issues, in order to help the listeners reflect on their own attitudes/prejudices. In fact the feedback from the audience was very positive, and the swing was genuinely marked. For the first time this year, the Forum had recruited a patient panel to help us frame the agenda and ensure proper patient representation. Again this was well-received, and patient inclusion will only deepen in future.<br /><br />As for IHI: it is a not-for-profit that does superlative work, improving healthcare in many different countries. It reaches millions of professionals, and its model is that the fees it receives from health systems in the developed world, pay for the work it does in low-income countries. Many of its resources, such as its Open School, are completely free. The Forum, now in its 20th year, does not cost IHI anything. There is no 'hidden hand', whatever that is supposed to mean; most of the delegates pay to attend, and the costs are also met by the sponsors, all of whom are publicly acknowledged, and the most generous of which is the Health Foundation.

1125	253	1	"Whenever I looked into medicines, I used to read the name of pharmaceutical, the manufactured date and expiry date printed on the Drug foil just to make sure I buy the safest and genuine Medicine. I always thought the drug becomes poisonous the very next month after its expiry date(month to be precise, as is mentioned) so, I was utmost careful before buying one.<br /><br /> I’m into Final year of Medical School but I still haven’t figured out why that people and even I are so is worried when it comes to Date-expired drugs. Sounds a bit weird but you need logic to support or refute any claim. So I thought of doing some research into it.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> So is it a Marketing strategy or a genuine health-related call, do the Pharmaceuticals want round-the-clock and round-the-year money or do they really care about Health of Patients?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The Expiry date mentioned on a drug means the Pharmaceutical Company gives a guarantee of the full potency and safety of the drug, it does not mean how long the drug is actually ""good"" or safe to use. This is based on a law that began in 1979 in United States.<br /><br /> Theoretically what I Know is Drugs like Tetracycline when used after expired date cause Renal Tubular Damage because of degraded products (Epitetracycline etc.) and liquid preparations are usually unstable if kept for long. Other drugs like Nitroglycerin and Insulin are also found to be unsafe but not the case with majority of other drugs.<br />  <br /><br /> Even though not much of data are available in this, one is:<br /> A study conducted by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requested by the military occurred due to the fact that the military faces tossing out and replacing a large expensive pile of drugs every few years(approximating $1 Billion). The study found that 90% of more than 100 different prescription and non-prescription drugs were still safe and effective to use even 15 years after the date of expiration.<br /><br /> That however doesn’t mean drugs are safe even after expiry date. There is a lack of evidence/study/trials regarding efficacy of expired-drugs..<br /><br /> Always store drug in a cool, dark and dry place and let’s wait for a unbiased study results to this issue.<br /><br /> Expecting some inputs..."

1126	253	1	Every anaesthetist 'knows' that suxamethonium, the short acting muscle relaxant for rapid intubation, must be kept in the fridge.     If an ampoule was left out on the bench for as much as a list, I would say - throw it away!   Then, at the Olympics, we were given a drug pack, just a plastic box, that included sux, together with documentation to reassure us that sux at room temperature was good for three months!<br /><br /> I think you may have a good case, Samirjha, for a reassessment of drug expiry times.<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-04-03 09:35:00	2	0
1127	253	1	A very relevant problem , but so much depends on which drug. There is some ongoing reassessment of lifespan of (I think ) ciprofloxacin. So far seems OK even some years after expiry date. The problem with antibiotics is that in many respects it is the drug activity not clinical effect that is being marketed , so a decay of 10% may not be clinicaly relevant but could be in terms of license agreement etc... Put another way , I have been quite happy to swallow some quite outdated tablets but would be hesitant about giving them to patients. The cynic might say , most of them will either not be taken or not needed but that is a separate issue. I have also worked on the basis that many of the tablets I am likely to swallow are for effect (eg analgaesia) and have not noticed any loss of efficacy. Ppi have a problem with storage , but are now sold mostly in blister packs. I am a bit wary with time expired drugs if they disintegrate when exposed to the light of day....<br /><br /> The big worry is always about storage - antibiotics used for travel may be faced with shortish periods of very cold conditions (plane flight) followed by a few weeks in a hot environment - but common sense over storage in the UK should not be a problem. Perhaps not dissimilar to wine - just recently we opened a bottle of very good white from our cellar and it had clearly gone off .t. Yet last year I had given a bottle to someone who is very fussy about wine and he thought it brilliant. When drugs /wine go off they can go off quite quickly? And of course the rules for one wine may not apply to others.<br /><br /> I think the tetracycline problem wa largely related to the very old capsule formulation not the tetracyline itself - is there any evidence that it still applies ?<br /><br /> Practically , as with tinned and packaged foods , there will always be commercial pressures to have an expiry date , both in terms of testing efficacy (just how much would it cost to explore decay over a period of , say, 15 years ) and in sales. Medically , we really need to know about adequate storage but also discourage old drugs lyin around. As a child (pre-NHS) I remember the GP giving the OK for my father who was sick with a chest infection to take the sulphonamides we had kept in the cupboard for our dog.<br /><br /> The real tragedy is that some of those in the third world feel there is disrespect in being given tablets just passed their official shelf life - better to go without than be dissed...	sken	2015-04-03 12:25:00	2	0

1129	253	1	I learned from my senior consultants that once upon time, drugs did not have an expiry date. They used to assess the colour of of a solution, prior to injection. Another consultantcited a study that Methylphenidate was active after seven years after expiry.<br /><br /> My main worry is exposure to heat. This does not show on expiry date. There is not thermal indicators on each pack to show whether they were subjected to heat or not.	Sidhom	2015-04-06 13:31:00	2	0

Some or many of you would have even used the method yourself.<br /><br /> I find that in UK healthcare that there are many problems in the way we use the PDSA. Many who use the PDSA seem not to know what comes before and what comes after their PDSA efforts. I also suspect that many senior persons also do not either know or care about this issue.<br /><br /> That is the issue I discuss in my latest blog<br /><br />http://successinhealthcare.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/the-problem-with-pdsa-in-healthcare.html<br /><br /> What is your experience of PDSA?

1134	254	1	'PDSA' looks rather like Kolb's learning cycle by another name.  Referring to your blog, it's certainly been unusual for any good learning cycle to be used by Government departments of health so it seems a bit rich for one of these departments to be telling the Medical Profession to use the process.  How many DOH 'innovations' have we seen presented for scrutiny in genuine peer-reviewed journals?	Maxim	2014-12-28 23:32:00	0	0
1135	254	1	Kolb cycle is from 1980s <br />PDSA as an implementation tool dates 1920s or 1930s and has proven success in health care for about 30 years. <br />You are right about government telling us but we should be adopting the QI methods a bit more enthusiastically and do it properly. Not doing so is harming health care.	Hemadri	2015-01-01 10:23:00	0	0

1138	255	1	Very interesting . I wonder how many doctors implement the suggestions already - I think it has been around for some time? Some of the relatively relaxed atmosphere may stem subconsciously from the doctor anyway once the caecum has been reached. Colonoscopy certainly could be a pretty brutish procedure , but hopefully now that doctors are trained and instruments so much improved this applies much less. ( I remember comment about  1 doctor - you could tell when he had a list as the screams could be heard outside the hospital.... ). . Personally I felt one of he low points of medical care was when we were encouraged to use midazolam freely - and then to reverse it - on the grounds that the patient would have poor recall for distress. Good advice for some torturers perhaps but less than ideal for health care professionals. It is a pity that carefully titrated analgaesia is now frowned upon.	sken	2014-02-21 14:04:00	0	0
1139	255	1	You are absolutely right Sken.

1141	257	1	If a patient that has capacity decides that they don't want to know the full extent of their condition and wants the doctor to make decisions regarding their treatment should the doctor comply as it is the patient's wish?	Arousa	2014-05-24 18:28:00	0	0
1142	257	1	Of course, the doctor should respect the wishes of the patient. Make a record of this in her/his notes. Write to the GP, and copy to the patient, the clinic letter, and get on with the treatment. <br /><br /> It seems very good that the patient has trust in the doctor as usual and the patient will accept the treatment offered.	Basha63002	2014-05-24 21:54:00	0	0
1143	257	1	To a greater or lesser extent this is a common occurrence but it's a mistake to think that there's always a one-off answer that will serve the whole duration of the doctor patient relationship.<br /><br /> Of, course, the 'right' answer is always to respect the patient's wishes but we might need to understand the patient's wishes more fully to be able to give the sort of respect that helps the patient with what they want and need.<br /><br /> In the course of making it clear that we intend, as far as possible, to comply with the patient's wishes it's perfectly reasonable to ask diplomatically about possible reasons for these wishes and, in particular, whether the patient has any strong suspicions of the diagnosis and what might happen.  Fear about serious disease might underlie the wish not to have information but if serious disease is then found it will presumably become clear in due course.  Sometimes the wish not to know can be because the knowing can have certain time-limited consequences such as insurance or travel plans.<br /><br /> Given that this sort of discussion arises where there are likely to be several meetings it's also OK to revisit those wishes carefully at subsequent meetings and not to assume that the wishes will never change.  Even where the patient's initial views seem firm they might still appreciate a discussion of the ways in which their preferred care is likely to be better if there can be sharing of information and options. <br /><br /> Perhaps the one absolute is not to be persuaded, without the patient's permission, to give assertive relatives the information that the patient has not received.

1144	257	1	"""Even where the patient's initial views seem firm they might still appreciate a discussion of the ways in which theirpreferred care is likely to be better if there can be sharing of information and options"". <br /><br />I fully agree with Maxim, and her above statement is true in real life conditions."

1145	257	1	Thanks for the endorsement, Basha<br /><br /> I'm sure it was a typo but I ought to confirm that, the last time I looked, Maxim was still a 'him'.	Maxim	2014-05-25 13:07:00	0	0
1146	257	1	Thank you for the comments. My only concern was that if patients don't actually have all the information can they then make the decision to allow the doctor to make all decisions? But as you mentioned Maxim, it would probably be good to revisit the patient's wishes and emphasise that discussing options and sharing information may help them make a more informed decision about their care.	Arousa	2014-05-25 13:12:00	0	0
1147	257	1	Arousa<br /><br /> You make the very good point that the criteria for capacity include the abilies to understand, remember and appreciate the implications of decisions and of information.  Here there might seem to be a dilemma in that the patient is deciding not to be told some of the information to be understood, remembered and used. <br /><br />  My response would be that the patient would need to appreciate that those criteria also apply to the potential consequences of not having information.  Ironically, the patient might well know some of those consequences better than does the doctor.  For both parties, however, there will be many unknowns and uncertainties and that also needs to be accepted and appreciated by the patient. <br /><br /> As Basha has pointed out, it is so important to document these discussions and decisions, not just as legal precaution, but as a basis for revisiting the discussion at each visit.

1148	257	1	Well I too believe that we need to respect every patient's sentiments, it is the prime most duty of the Doctor to keep a note in writing, at the same time acknowledging the actual condition of the patient to his near & dear ones.	CAUrgentCare	2014-05-26 06:07:00	0	0
1149	257	1	"Unfortunately this is a question where there is no satisfactory answer. We assume that one of our duties is to impart information - perhaps something to do with a pretence of being in control. The problem becomes very relevant when trying to obtain informed consent but even more so when the prognosis is very poor. Looking after someone who does not want to know that life is likely to be very limited can be challenging - not least because initial unwillingness to hear may not be their real feeling.. For some it may be a coping mechanism but for others it seems that an understanding of probabilities is beyond their grasp. So how does one explain stopping pointless therapies etc ... ? For some too it seems their knowledge of a very limited lifespan simply puts an impossible burden on the remaining weeks or months. It is a bit late when the patient says ""I wish you had not told me that"" .<br /><br /> The answer by urgentcare is all well and good - except that sometimes patients specifically state that they do not wish their nearest and dearest to know if the news is bad - now that really must be entered in the notes."	sken	2014-05-27 21:14:00	0	0

1152	260	1	If you look at all the media headlines and numbers being thrown around you would be justfied in thiniking that there was so many needless or avoidable deaths that if all of them were prevented UK could become immortal.<br /><br /> So I quickly added up the media numbers and found 254k lives could be saved that means if we got it right we will be 60% on our way to immortality. Any takers?<br /><br /> This of course is different from another measure called 'mortality amenable to healthcare' which gives us a more realistic or plausible idea,<br /><br /> A few more words on my blog http://successinhealthcare.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/in-search-of-immortality.html	Hemadri	2013-09-26 11:57:00	0	0

1154	260	1	We need to know that we are not mistake proof.

There we have a communication problem. We need not  be afraid to talk to families and need not to appear as if we hold some kind of secret/s. So, being open and at the same time sympathetic will not hurt our ego, but will bring us more points for the hard work we do to save patients every day.	yoram chaiter	2013-09-26 19:36:00	0	0
1155	260	1	Agreed with Tim and Yoram. Although we can prevent deaths if we are able to apply our fullest clinical strength, there are many instances where we might find ourselves hopeless!

1159	262	1	"A) There are many unknowns in medicine / anaesthesia. I am persuated that this is example when the ""evidence"" in the literature can be based on expert opinion and not on proper evidence based medicine. I was very interested in expert opinion. I expected more answers but thank you a lot for this one.   <br /><br /> B) Another expert opinion: I communicated by email with "" a prominent anaesthetist"" from Stanford University, US, his answer was:<br /><br /> 1) in case of pneumothorax - do you postpone general anaesthesia/surgery for carcinoma and for how long?                                                                                                                                                                   Answer: If there is a chest tube in place, there is no risk for general anesthesia on a patient with a chest tube. We do it frequently in take back cases following open heart or open chest surgery. If the surgeon was willing, you could do the surgery the same day, providing there was no bleeding and no vital sign instability.<br /><br /> 2) in case of pneumothorax - do you postopone general anaesthesia/surgery if tumor is benign and for how long?                                                                                                                                                         Answer: Same as for 1), except that for a benign tumor there is no urgency, and the surgical team may well delay until the patient has no chest tube and is again in excellent condition.<br /><br /> C) OK, but it resulted in my other two questions: <br /><br /> 3)  in case that pneumothorax is small and not drained: do you postpone general anaesthesia/surgery for elective surgery and for how long?  If you decide to do surgery - do you insert chest drain before surgery?<br /><br /> 4)  in case that pneumothorax is small and not drained: do you postopone general anaesthesia/surgery for carcinoma and for how long?  If you decide to do surgery - do you insert chest drain before surgery?<br /><br /> Thank you for your opinions and experiences.<br /><br /> Jeremy Richter"	Jeremy Richter	2016-01-06 11:28:00	0	0
1160	262	1	Jeremy,<br /><br /> Thank you for your patience!<br /><br /> I'm a (retired) anaesthetist.  I agree partly  with the above, and probably wholly if we were able to talk abouit it around the coffee cups.<br /><br /> In the scenario you give, I would as Silverfox says be concnered that the conditions of anaesthesia would make a pneumothorax worse, even tension if the drain was inadeqaute in the face of nitrous oxide if you must use that outdated agent and the positive pressure ventilation that major abdominal surgery will require.    After all, my misplaced CVP needle has probably damaged lung tissue, so that gas and blood will continue to escape<br /><br /> I would discuss the relative risk with the surgeon.   Would one or two days delay impose no significant risk to curing the patient?   Could the surgeon reschedule the case in a reasonable time?   If the answer was yes to both then postpone the operation, and of course take time to explain to the patient as soon as possible. For how long?   That is more difficult to say.     At least until a day after the drain has been removed, and a check CXR has confirmed no residual air.<br /><br /> If not, then position a formal chest drain (not just an apical stab), ensure that the drainage can be observed continuously, and monitor chest sounds.    I think I might recruit a colleague (who is an expert)to advise on the use of ultrasound to monitor frequently the state of the pneumothorax.<br /><br /> I would use a technique that excludes nitrous oxide, and use the same technique and monitoring when a postponed patient came to theatre.  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> John	John D	2016-01-07 08:51:00	0	0
1161	262	1	"Jeremy - Many thanks for this thread. I fequently looked to see opinions , knowing we have at least one anaesthetist among our doc2doc regulars. The eventual answers were as expected. I recall the way pneumonectomy was carried out years ago and the most junior doctor just re-adjusted pressures as necessary on the wards. A very simple procedure ... Well , there was the occasion when a colleague re-adjusted them on the wrong side(ie gave the patient a pneumothorax on the good side as well) . The nurse recognised what had happened very quickly and I happened to be around . Speedy action and no real harm done , no complaint , no ""clinical  incident"" , no repercussions etc... How times have changed ? My message from this anecdote is that the patient might need to be monitored on a ward with at least a nodding acquaintance with chest drains, Has anyone done an audit of chest drains in a DGH to see how many are still working?<br /><br /> I have a very distinct impression that a number of surgeons , particularly older ones, at times wish to find an excuse for not operating.<br /><br /> There are too many imponderables - relative need for surgery , etc... as John D has pointed out. Overall lung function is perhaps just as important- there are folk where the pneumothorax is chronic.<br /><br /> And of course , as an oldie I wondered just why he was having jugular vein cannulation as a routine  I remember one unit where this was done routinely on all those queried a sG-I bleeds - primarily for training purposes - as opposed to those where the bleed was thought significant. The widespread use of Swan-Ganz catheters perhaps had a similar basis.

Essentially the problem is that once the patient ""comes round"" there is inadequate follow-up. Some examples from my own experience or those I know about - effect of drop in blood pressure (not necessarily an absolute drop but one related to individual) , post operative renal problems , possible exacerbation of poor cerebral functioning in the elderly , symptoms associated with spinal cord damage after spinal etc.... None of these would necessarily be relayed back to the anaesthetists concerned who may blithely conclude all is well.<br /><br />  Years ago as an acute physician we ised to admit a number of post -operative surgical problems but the surgeon running the surgical audit did not want to know with a singularly unhelpful response along the lines of what about the problems caused by the physicians."	sken	2015-10-16 13:51:00	0	0

Patients should be premedicated with drugs that provide sedation and analgesia prior to anesthetic induction with drugs that allow endotracheal intubation. Maintenance is typically with a volatile anesthetic such as isoflurane or sevoflurane delivered via an endotracheal tube. In addition, local anesthetic nerve blocks; epidural administration of opioids; and constant-rate infusions of lidocaine, ketamine, and opioids are useful to enhance analgesia. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous system functions are continuously monitored so that anesthetic depth can be modified as needed. Emergency drugs and equipment, as well as an action plan for their use, should be available throughout the perianesthetic period. Additionally, intravenous access and crystalloid or colloids are administered to maintain circulating blood volume. Someone trained in the detection of recovery abnormalities should monitor patients throughout recovery. Postoperatively, attention is given to body temperature, level of sedation, and appropriate analgesia. (J Am Anim Hosp Assoc 2011; 47:377–385.

1177	267	1	The correct answer is Hypercapnia <br /><br />  <br /><br />Explanation:<br /><br />One of the most important factors that regulate cerebral vascular tone is PaCO2. Carbon dioxide induces cerebral vasodilatation and therefore increases CBF. There is a linear increase between a PaCO2 between 20 mmHg (2.7 kPa) and 80 mmHg (8.6 kPa).<br /><br />There are likely to be areas where autoregulation may have failed locally but not globally. Similarly local versus systemic acidosis will have similar effects. The CBF does not significantly change until the PaO2 falls below 50 mmHg (6.5 kPa) below which the CBF progressively increases.<br /><br />Hyperthermia causes an increase in the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) and therefore CBF. (CMRO2 and CBF are linked). Hyperthermia secondary to hypothalamic injury can be a late feature of cerebral injury and is therefore not the most likely cause of an increased CBF in this scenario.<br /><br />Try more Primary FRCA practice question from OnExamination here	OnExamination	2015-09-28 14:46:00	0	0
1178	268	1	Anaesthesia is all about anticipating problems and overcoming them.   One that is at the front of every anaesthetist's mind is the airway, and today that task has been made much easier by the several Supra-Glottic Airway (SGA)  devices that are available.     To anticipate any problems, there are clinical scoring systems,  that can indicate potentially difficult airways and intubations, but this case totally slipped by them.<br /><br /> The patient was to have procedure for which an SGA was appropriate, and scored normally on all indicators of airway difficulty.     But an i-gel SGA could not be positioned, nor could a Laryngeal Mask Airway (for non-anaesthetists, SGAs are normally passed blind).    So we had a look into the patient's pharynx, and this is what we saw.<br /><br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /> Lower picture shows the laryngosope being used a tongue depressor;  the upper was the ebst view that could be obtained of the larynx.<br /><br /> What would you do next?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> John	John D	2015-06-14 10:54:00	0	0
1179	268	1	I don't know what's causing this appearance but it sounds as if it might have been there for a long time.  Presumably the patient isn't breathing spontaneously so the most urgent consideration would be oxygenation by mask and bag initially.  If the procedure had to continue, would indirect nasal laryngoscopy help?  I might also find myself praying to the patron saint of anaesthetists if such a thing exists.  Maybe best to postpone the procedure and image the pharynx. <br /><br /> I won't be surprised if my answer confirms it was a good thing I wasn't an anaesthetist or an ENT surgeon!

1200	273	1	Emergency and difficult tracheal intubations are hazardous undertakings where successive laryngoscopy–hypoxaemia–re-oxygenation cycles can escalate to airway loss and the ‘can't intubate, can't ventilate’ scenario.<br /><br /> New research, published in Anaesthesia shows that 'pre-post-oxygenation', achieved using the Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) technique, can increase the safe apnoeic window for 25 patients with difficult/impossible airways to a median of 14 minutes (range 5 - 65 minutes).  <br /><br /> These findings, if replicated in larger studies, have the potential to transform the nature of difficult intubations from a hurried and stressful 'stop-start' process, limited by rapid desaturations and re-oxygenations, to a smooth and unhurried undertaking.  <br /><br /> Full text paper can be downloaded from http://ow.ly/EeOoC	rezanouraei	2014-11-16 21:17:00	0	0

1209	274	1	All the anaesthetic vapours have a distinct odour, and while nitrous oxide is odourless, it's MAC - Minimum Anaesthetic (or Alveolar) Concentration - is over 100%!   Which means that it is hard to incapacitate someone with N2O alone.    Used to done, but by partioaly asphyxiating the poor patient.   Tere have been stories since the 19th Century of burglars and others subding people with chloroform, but that would need a soaked pad held to the face, and while Chloroform is quite potent, they victim would need to be bound and gagged, or kept under with the chloroform.<br /><br /> An anaesthetic that could subdue someone who neither cooperates nor knows that they are being subdued is a long sought target by security services.   Whena Chechen seperatists held hostage a Moscow theatre full of people in 2002, the Russians pumped a nebulised form of fentanyl into the air conditioning system.  It was unsuccesful in subduing the terrorists, but zapped many the hostages.  In the ensuing gun battle most of the terrorist were killed.    Of the 850 hostages, 130 died, only one from gunshot wounds, the rest narcotised to death, largely because the Russian authorities did not tell the many doctors and paramedcs standing by that they had used a narcotic.    Simple antagonists like naloxone could have saved many, who were thought to have had infarcts or other problems.   Many probably asphysiated from loss of airway becoming unconcious sitting in a theatre seat.<br /><br /> No, I don't think that there is any 'gas', available to a lorry robber, that could temporarily incapacitate the driver without high risk of permanent injury.<br /><br /> JOhn	John D	2014-09-04 13:02:00	0	0

1215	276	1	This opinion was emailed to me by Dr Innes from Australia<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Mr Darryl Elliot was convicted for the murder of Amelia Bowmar on the evidence of doctors who alleged Amelia was Shaken to death. The basis of this allegation was the presence of a subdural haematoma, swelling of the brain with ischaemic changes and haemorrhagic contusions in the cortex of the right and left superior frontal gyri of the brain. The brain and spinal cord showed evidence of old and recent injury which the doctors attributed to “Non-accidental Injury”. The condition was given the name “Shaken Baby Syndrome” in 1971 by a neurosurgeon Dr Guthkelch, who unsurprisingly, could offer no other explanation for the bleeding, bruises and fractures seen in these children and incredible as it may seem, neither could the doctors in the UK who reported on Amelia a year ago. I should add there are some doctors in Australia, Canada and the USA who also have the same problem causing hundreds of innocent carers to be imprisoned. Sally Clark, Angela Canning and Trupti Patel were not the last victims of medical ignorance. Amelia had a disorder of the coagulation system as shown by a raised INR of 1.3, an APTT of 39.6. which would explain the brain and other haemorrhages but the evidence  was ignored by the doctors alleging murder. Their preoccupation with the Shaken Baby Syndrome hypothesis also ignored the elevation of the level of Glucose in the blood and the presence of Glucose in the Urine of Amelia. Both these features are manifestations of an Autoimmune response to antigenic stimulation as explained in the attached document [1].  In this case it was the vaccines given to Amelia a few days prior to her falling ill which initiated the process. Vaccines caused the problem and Darryl Elliot was blamed. I reported the matter to the General Medical Council and got the reply “It would be inappropriate for the GMC to become involved in academic debate between groups of experts who hold differing opinions”.<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> So it is up to the  Presidents of Royal Colleges of Medicine to show some leadership and instruct their members to abandon the flat earth mainstream fabrication and adopt a rational approach. Until the Medical Profession realizes that the Shaken Baby Syndrome is a  fabricated diagnosis without a shred of scientific evidence they are going to continue falsely accuse innocent people and deceiving the Judiciary. How much longer can this shameful situation continue? Parliament has an excellent example of a false conviction in the case of  Darryl Elliot and should take the opportunity to rectify the situation and restore Justice to people of the land and release all falsely convicted prisoners.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Michael D Innis MBBS; DTM&H; FRCPA; FRCPath<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Reference<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 1.

1217	276	1	Tissue Scurvy – Not Shaken Baby<br /><br />Abstract<br /><br /> Parents and Carers are often falsely accused of injuring a child asserting that unexplained bruises, fractures, retinal and subdural haemorrhages with ischaemic encephalopathy, the so called “Triad” are signs of physical abuse. However these features can be the result of Tissue Scurvy, a disorder of Vitamin C metabolism in which Vitamin C, although abundant in the plasma, is unable to enter the cell because of a lack of Insulin which is necessary to conduct the transfer of the Vitamin C into the cell. The cause is an autoimmune reaction which destroys the Insulin-producing Beta cells of the Pancreas in some genetically susceptible children. Here it is shown that the evidence of the Prosecution Experts alleging death from the Shaken Baby Syndrome was demonstrably flawed.  The diagnosis Shaken Baby Syndrome is false and an innocent man was incarcerated.  This irrational diagnosis should be abandoned.<br />  <br /><br />Introduction<br /><br /> Mr Darryl Elliot was convicted for the murder of Amelia Bowmar on the evidence of doctors who alleged Amelia was Shaken to death. The basis of this allegation was the presence of a subdural haematoma, swelling of the brain with ischaemic changes and haemorrhagic contusions in the cortex of the right and left superior frontal gyri of the brain. The brain and spinal cord showed evidence of old and recent injury which was attributed to “Non-accidental Injury”. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The situation in which the carers of the child could offer no explanation for fractures, bruises, retinal and cerebral haemorrhages with ischaemic encephalopathy was given the name “Shaken Baby Syndrome” in 1971 by a neurosurgeon Dr Guthkelch, who unsurprisingly, could offer no other explanation for the lesions in these children and incredible as it may seem nor could the doctors in the UK who reported on Amelia Bowmar a year ago.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Amelia had a disorder of the coagulation system as shown by a raised INR of 1.3,(NR 0.89 - 1.2) an APTT of 39.6.(NR 25-35 sec) which would explain the brain and other haemorrhages but the evidence  was ignored by the doctors alleging murder, who were obviously uninformed in relation to the interpretation of these and other Laboratory results. (The NR was not provided in the original report and has been added by me from my personal knowledge as a Haematologist.)<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Their preoccupation with the Shaken Baby Syndrome hypothesis also ignored the elevation of the level of Glucose in the blood and the presence of Glucose in the urine of Amelia. Both these features are manifestations of an Autoimmune response to antigenic stimulation as I have explained [1].  In this case it was the vaccines given to Amelia a few days prior to her falling ill which initiated the process.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Vaccines caused the problem and Darryl Elliot was blamed. There is a simple solution to this problem- a “skin prick test” before administering the vaccine to determine vaccine sensitivity in the child. The test should be mandatory. .<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Until the Medical Profession realizes that the Shaken Baby Syndrome is a fabricated diagnosis without a shred of scientific evidence, they are going to continue to falsely accuse innocent people and deceive the Judiciary.<br /><br /> Mr Justice MacDuff sentencing Darryl Elliott for the murder of his partner’s baby Amelia Bowmar said,  “You have been convicted, on overwhelming evidence, of the murder of Amelia Bowmar, a little girl of 14 months whose care had been entrusted to you by your partner; her mother. Your job was to look after and protect her but, instead, she died at your hands.<br /><br /> It is clear to me that because you perceived her to be misbehaving, or perhaps because you had to deal with her when she was sick, or just because you lost your temper at something wholly unconnected with her behaviour, you so violently and deliberately shook her as to the catastrophic injuries from which she died. Only you know exactly what went on inside that house on July 28 last year.<br /><br /> I accept that this was a spur of the moment loss of temper and also that you did not intend to kill. I also accept that you were immediately full of remorse – although that remorse has to be seen alongside an attempt to distance yourself from what you did, and a failure to acknowledge your responsibility. Your failure to tell the truth in those early hours meant that the medical teams spent time investigating other possible causes. I am satisfied that Amelia was so seriously compromised that she would have died anyway. But you were not to know that.”<br /><br /> The Judge was obviously completely deceived by the evidence of the doctors and the “overwhelming evidence” he refers to when analysed is demonstrably “overwhelming incorrect” as demonstrated here.<br /><br />  <br /><br />                         --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />                                                <br /><br /> Dr P  H T Cartlidge<br /><br />                            Specialist Field Paediatrics<br /><br />  <br /><br />  Dr P  H T Cartlidge in his evidence said, “in my opinion the head injury was not caused by a fall from the seat of the settee and I struggle to conceive how Amelia could have climbed higher”. He goes on to say “the mechanism of non-accidental head injury causing an acute encephalopathic illness, acute subdural bleeding and retinal haemorrhages is thought to be shaking, an impact or a combination of both. In shaking a child is often grasped around the chest and shaken.<br /><br />  <br /><br />   Squeezing the chest impairs the return of blood to the heart and thereby causes an increase in venous blood pressure. This in turn causes engorgement of the veins that traverse the subdural space on the surface of the brain. Shaking the child and/or hitting the child’s head on a firm object leads to marked accellaration-decellaration forces that rupture these engorged veins, resulting in subdural haemorrhage  The same shearing forces generated by shaking-impact can damage the parenchyma of the brain and also the spinal cord and cord roots”.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Comment <br /><br />Dr Cartlidge gives an accurate account of the mainstream opinion of the Shaken Baby Syndrome which ignores crucial biochemical evidence such as Increased Glucose in the Blood (Hyperglycaemia), Abnormal Liver Function Test, Abnormal Coagulation Tests and Glycosuria (sugar in the urine) proving an Autoimmune Disease – TISSUE SCURVY.  The Shaken Baby Syndrome is unscientific speculation.<br /><br /> Read this article. Autoimmunity and Non-Accidental Injury in Children, Clinical Medicine Research. Vol. 2, No. 3, 2013, pp. 40-44. doi: 10.11648/j.cmr.20130203.15 <br /><br />Abstract<br /> Background: The Shaken Baby Syndrome conceived by Guthkeltch to explain bruises, fractures, retinal and cerebral haemorrhage and encephalopathy in children, called the “triad”, can be explained by an autoimmune reaction to antigens in a genetically susceptible child. Method: Children diagnosed as suffering from Non-accidental injuries were investigated for evidence of immune response reactions following mandated vaccination and childhood illnesses. Results: It was found in all the cases reported here the response to antigenic stimulation damaged the Beta cells in the Pancreas causing Hypoinsulinaemia which inhibited the cellular uptake of Vitamin C resulting in liver dysfunction, failure of carboxylation of the Vitamin K dependent proteins resulting in haemorrhages and fractures associated with the “triad”. Conclusion: Fractures, retinal and subdural haemorrhages and encephalopathy in children – is an autoimmune response to antigenic stimulation in a genetically susceptible individual. Common antigens are the mandated vaccines, viral bacterial and parasitic infections.

Neuropathology has revealed recent injuries including subdural bleeding, axonal injury in the medulla and spinal nerve roots, and fresh bleeding within older contusions within the brain itself. There is also evidence of older injury including older subdural bleeding and cerebral contusions. These are indicative of at least one, but possibly more than one, episode of significant head trauma. These neuropathological appearances are entirely consistent with non-accidental injury also referred to as paediatric head injury or sometimes “Adult Induced Injury”. Although some authors have proposed theoretical models that would indicate a natural single underlying cause leading to the finding of subdural haematoma brain swelling and retinal haemorrhage to my knowledge these theoretical models have not been accepted by the Courts. The presence of this combination of findings is entirely consistent with a traumatic etiology. The lack of external injury means that it is not possible to state that there has been an impact to the head, although the possibility of an impact that has not left an external injury must exist”.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Comment<br /><br />I am one of the authors that “have proposed theoretical models that would indicate a natural single underlying cause leading to the finding of subdural haematoma brain swelling and retinal haemorrhage”. Amelia had an elevated Blood Glucose and Glucose in her Urine, features which confirm a diagnosis of Tissue Scurvy as reported in the manuscript below.<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />Title<br /><br />Tissue Scurvy and the Triad” <br /><br />Abstract.<br /><br /> The Triad, characterized by bilateral retinal haemorrhages, diffuse cerebral haemorrhage and hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy is conventionally thought to result from trauma caused by violently shaking a child by a parent or carer. The shaking is said to cause a to and fro movement of the brain in the skull leading to injury to the neurons, disruption of the cerebral veins and trauma to the retinal vessels. Vigorous shaking of a child has never been observed and an alternative explanation for these changes was sought. Here it is shown that Tissue Scurvy, an autoimmune disorder which has specific and consistent biochemical features of Hyperglycaemia and Liver Dysfunction as shown by abnormal Liver Function Tests, is the cause of the lesions.<br /><br /> A child diagnosed as being the victim of the Shaken Baby Syndrome was tested for evidence of Tissue Scurvy and both Hyperglycaemia and Abnormal Liver Function were demonstrated. It is concluded that these results provide conclusive evidence that the Shaken Baby Syndrome is a form of Tissue Scurvy in which encephalopathy is caused by damage to neurons in the cervical spinal column causing hypoxia, which leads to ischaemic encephalopathy and the other features of the triad.<br /><br />                        <br /><br />                                     ----------------------------------------------------                                                                              Dr Jayamohan Jayaratnam                        <br /><br />                                    Consultant Paediatric Neurosurgeon                                                                                                                                                                         <br /><br /> Dr Jayamohan Jayaratnam discussed all the available evidence including the fact that Initial blood clotting tests show some raised clotting times with an INR of 1.3, an APTT of 39.6  and an APTT ratio of 1.3.  With support from the evidence of  Dr AL SARRAG  concluded “in my view this sufficient support for my already formed view that there is likely to have been a traumatic explanation for Amelia’s collapse. In view the globalized findings of ischaemia, it was hard to place exactly what may have occurred. However with the focal injuries described by Dr AL SARRAG, in view of the absence of external signs of injury and in view of the bilateral severe ophthalmology findings, I believe it is highly indicative that a non-impact traumatic injury otherwise known as a shaking type injury has occurred to Amelia”.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Comment<br /><br />     Dr Jayamohan clearly identifies an abnormality of the clotting mechanism and then, for no reason whatever, chooses to ignore it as a cause of the bleeding in the skull and elsewhere. His illogical conclusion needs to be further investigated by his governing body for the safety of others with similar coagulation profiles.<br /><br /> Others may suffer the same fate as Darryl Elliot if he continues to hold this view.<br /><br />                                                --------------------------------------------    <br /><br />  <br /><br />                                    <br /><br />Dr Neil Gordon Stoodley<br /><br />Consultant Neuroradiologist<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Dr Neil Gordon Stoodley Consultant Neuroradiologist concluded his assessment of the situation with the remark “I cannot think of a biologically plausible mechanism that would potentially directly link any event occurring toward the end of May 2012 and Amelia’s presentation with a severe (indeed fatal)” encephalopathic illness at the end of July.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The scan abnormalities are all explicable on the basis of being due to an episode of non-accidental head injury. The mechanism of the injury is likely to have involved shaking. Majority medical opinion is of the view that what is likely to be required to produce such injuries is the backwards and forward movement of the unsupported infant head pivoting on the neck. It is believed that this leads to a degree of acceleration/deceleration and rotational forces and that the consequent differential rotation of the brain and skull leads to stretching of the subdural veins which cross the subdural space and it is this which leads to bleeding in the subdural space.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Comment<br /><br />Dr Stoodley could not “think of a biologically plausible mechanism that would potentially directly link any event occurring toward the end of May 2012 and Amelia’s presentation with a severe (indeed fatal)” encephalopathic illness at the end of July”.<br /><br />  <br /><br />The biologically plausible mechanism Dr Stoodley has difficulty in thinking of that would potentially directly link an event occurring toward the end of May 2012 and Amelia’s presentation with severe (indeed fatal) encepalopathic illness at the end of July is the MMR vaccine administered on 25th May 2012.<br /><br />An account of the condition-TISSUE SCURVY- which doctors including Dr Stoodley are obviously unaware of is featured below. When doctors understand Tissue Scurvy can be induced by vaccines in genetically susceptible children and causes the signs and symptoms found in Amelia, they will stop diagnosing Shaken Baby Syndrome. <br /><br />  <br /><br />Autoimmune Tissue Scurvy Misdiagnosed as Child Abuse<br />  <br /><br /> Michael D Innis, MBBS; DTM&H; FRCPA; FRC Path.

Viral and parasitic infections and vaccines cause an autoimmune disorder, Tissue Scurvy, misdiagnosed as child abuse. This report presents the evidence. Method. Relevant hospital and laboratory reports of three children were examined for evidence of Tissue Scurvy as the cause of the neurological lesions, fractures, bruises and haemorrhages found on them. Results. In all the cases in which appropriate histories and tests were done there was evidence that the doctors either misinterpreted the laboratory evidence or they were unaware of the significance of abnormal tests suggesting Tissue Scurvy as the cause. Conclusion. Some doctors are unaware of the pathophysiological processes of autoimmunity, haemostasis and osteogenesis and are misdiagnosing vaccine induced Tissue Scurvy, absence of Vitamin C within the cell, as Non-accidental Injury.<br /><br />Keywords<br /> Autoimmunity, Tissue Scurvy, Encephalomyelitis, Non-accidental Injury, Shaken Baby Syndrome<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />                                     --------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />                                                            Dr AL-SARRAJ<br /><br />                                                Consultant Neuropathologist<br /><br /> Dr AL-SARRAJ provides a detailed account of the findings and concludes “the clinical history indicates presence of extensive bilateral retinal haemorrhages. These injuries, in addition to the presence of subdural haematoma and generalized ischemia (ischaemic encephalopathy) form the triad frequently seen in patients with non-accidental head injury. This is further supported by presence of subdural haematoma in the spinal cord, axonal injury in the pyramids of the medulla and axonal injury in the spinal nerve roots.<br /><br /> The presence of axonal injury in the pyramids and spinal nerve roots suggest head and spinal cord injury resulting from violent hyper-extension and hyper-flexion of the head and neck similar to those seen in shaking. The presence of extensive retinal haemorrhages supports this suggestion.<br /><br /> The pathological findings in the brain have to be considered closely with other findings of autopsy examination, radiological examination, eye examination and other investigations, before final conclusion. I will review the pathological findings in the brain and my interpretation if further information becomes available.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br /> Head and spinal cord injury consistent with non-accidental injury.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Comment<br /><br />There is no conflict with Dr AL-SARRAJ’S findings but it is the interpretation of those findings which are disputed. He is evidently prepared to review his interpretation if further information becomes available and I draw his attention to the fact that Amelia had Biochemical as well as Anatomical lesions. The Biochemical lesions of Hyperglycaemia, Glycosuria, Coagulation Abnormality (INR 1,3, APTT 39.6) all suggest an Autoimmune Disorder –TISSUE SCURVY [1] which I am sure Dr AL-SARRAJ  is willing to consider. <br /><br /> Reference<br /><br /> 1.Innis M D.

I am not aware that these conditions have been identified”. <br /><br />  <br /><br />Comment<br /><br />The Hospital Records and Pathology Report of Amelia clearly showed:<br /><br />1.

1218	276	1	The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) has ruled that Dr Squier had given irresponsible evidence outside her area of expertise in a number of court cases.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> I want to be clear here that I am not discussing the formal hearing at all, just that an expert changes their opinion having held the consensus view for many years. Neither I am commenting on whether her opinion on SBS is correct or not. Just how difficult is it to change an overwhelming consensus amongst the medical profession about some aspect of care? Doesn't it often take a Doctor or group of Doctors to not side with the majority for change to be made?

Totally against consensus opinion - until the latter began to listen and looked hard at the evidence. I don't know whether vested interest played a part in surgical ridicule....<br /><br /> My initial thought about Dr Squier is simply that if she was acting outside her competence just who can give an opinion on SBS - and in condemning her could the GMC panel have been acting outside its competence. <br /><br /> Ther are undoubtedly doctors who push themselves forward to be ""expert"" witnesses for one reason or another . It is a brave or foolish person who does this over SBS and my impression was that she was not in the foolish category. Except in not keeping clear of ""tiger country"" I will look through the reference I have not yet read to see if I should change my mind, The few neuropathologists I have know have been very thoughtful - if a bit otherworldly - folk.<br /><br /> This is a case where a look back in 5- 10 years' time will be interesting. kirked - please enter this in your diary."	sken	2016-03-12 20:13:00	0	0
1220	276	1	If I've understood correctly, both the original proponent of pathological evidence for 'shaken baby syndrome' and now the person challenging the validity of that evidence have been 'discredited'.  That's really an extraordinary state of affairs.  The meaning and interpretation of 'scientific evidence' is much more complex and nuanced than the establishment realises, particularly when both principal paradigms seem now to have been discredited.  Particularly ironic when the accusations of acting outside her competence have been made by such a body as the GMC, allegedly with the support of the police, neither body having been strangers to this accusation themselves.<br /><br /> I can only hope that the press publish the names of the panel members casting the stones if and when the fragilty of this 'scientific evidence' finally comes to be accepted. A defence of having given their honest opinions will, of course have been rendered invalid by their own reasoning in this case.

1221	276	1	"Maxim - Not their names but the Guardian lists the panel members as including (but I think 3 is the usual number anyway) : a retired RAF officer , a retired policeman and a retired community psychiatrist. Just the combination of folk qualified to weigh up the evidence in this highly complex and tricky territory? Presumably there will be an appeal. <br /><br /> It is awful emotional and judicial territory : damning the parent may mean a death penalty in the USA and nearly as bad in the UK (just think what treatment the ""culprit"" will have in prison) . Letting a killer walk free seems not quite so awful - I do not know about follow-up but I would guess that some of these cases are where someone has just ""flipped"" and has to live with that anyway. I gather part of the problem was that she felt that the damage was not caused ""deiberately"" in the cases being considered. <br /><br /> Apart from the panel it would be interesting to know who were the expert witnesses and how big a pool there is of these  Some od the problem seems to have related to how Dr Squier presented her evidence and I think many of us are aware just how problematic that can be."	sken	2016-03-13 18:34:00	0	0

1223	277	1	"In his final judgement the Judge set out the salient facts thus:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 'Mrs C was born in 1956. At the time of the Angiogram she was 52. Her past medical history included heart burn, indigestion, ME,  and IBS.  In the past she has had episodes of depression, has complained of panic attacks and has long been anxious about her health. She has, in common with many, exhibited a dislike of medical procedures. On 14 April 2009, Mrs C complained to her GP of symptoms that were consistent with, or suggestive of,  angina  pectoris. As a consequence, she was referred to hospital where she attended for investigation on 28 April 2009. Following that consultation, Dr S of the hospital staff wrote to her GP:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> ""- chest pain history - considered to be suggestive of  angina  … Occurred on exercise, relieved by rest ... Risk factors for heart disease- patient stop smoking started 1970 stopped 2000 smoked on average 20 per day no history of strokes ... Examination heart sounds normal Apex beat, JVP normal. Carotid pulse was normal. The following heart murmurs were present: ESM Grade: 3 Respiratory system: normal. Investigations- ECG. Clinical diagnosis of possible  angina . Patient referred for echocardiogram … Typical chest pain, ex smoker, systolic murmur at the base of the heart. Echo and ETT arranged as urgent.""<br /><br />  <br /><br /> An echocardiogram was performed on Mrs C on 25 May 2009, reported as normal. On 3 June 2009, Mrs C performed an exercise test following which Dr G of the hospital recommended that an angiogram be performed on Mrs C. Dr G provided Mrs C with a consent form preparatory to performance of the angiogram.  In addition, Mrs C was sent an information sheet that explained the procedure in detail, and described risks involved with the procedure. In particular, the information sheet stated that:<br /><br /> ""… As all blood vessels are connected to the heart, gently passing the catheters through the arteries and veins carries them painlessly into the heart … In skilled and experienced hands problems are uncommon. Nevertheless, there is a small risk that a badly narrowed artery will block during the test. This can cause a myocardial infarction (heart attack) which can have serious consequences. This is more a risk of the disease rather than the technique …""<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Mrs C duly signed the consent form and, on 19 June 2009, attended the catheter laboratory. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The timing and sequence of events in the course of Mrs C's angiogram was not fully recorded as the equipment used does not automatically record what is visible during the procedure. However, the operator may record sequences of moving pictures of interest, in the course of the procedure and on a CD of Mrs C's angiogram, 48 sequences of moving pictures showing the procedure at different times are recorded.  In Mrs C's case the procedure commenced at about 11.00 a.m. when a local anaesthetic was given and an incision was made in her right arm to permit access for a catheter via her radial artery. Soon after the insertion of the catheter Mrs C began to suffer from spasm and pain in her right arm so the catheter was withdrawn. Another attempt to perform the angiogram via the radial approach was unsuccessful and therefore some minutes later, Dr M abandoned that approach and decided to attempt access via the femoral artery. Mrs C was given a local anaesthetic in her leg and at about 11.30 a.m and a catheter inserted via the femoral artery.<br /><br /> During the procedure staff monitored Mrs C's blood pressure and ECG.  At the commencement of the procedure the ECG record had been calibrated to zero and a baseline ECG was undertaken. The ECG was continuously monitored but it was not continuously recorded.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The prescription record shows 3 mg of morphine and 1.25 mg of diazepam at 11.20 a.m. It shows that between 11.20 a.m. and 11.50 a.m. a further 3 mg of morphine and 2.25 mg of diazepam was dispensed. In the course of the procedure Mrs C complained of pain in her right arm and of severe pain across her back, chest and jaw. It is agreed that she complained of pain in the right arm as soon as the spasm developed in her right arm; when she first complained of the other symptoms of pain is a central issue in this case. At an early stage in the course of the procedure Dr M saw from images obtained of Mrs C's heart that her left descending artery was occluded. This is a serious and potentially life threatening condition as that artery serves about 40% of the muscle of the heart. The detection of that condition turned the procedure being performed on Mrs C from an angiogram to an angioplasty. In Mrs C's case the identified occlusion was cleared by insertion of a balloon and then two stents into the arterial system of her heart, the stents being employed at about 12.30 p.m. when it first became visible on X-ray that there had been a dissection of the left main stem artery. Whether that occurred shortly after the angiogram procedure was begun via the radial route or only after the femoral route was begun is another important issue in this action.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> At some time after Dr M determined that the LAD was occluded he called for the attendance of Dr B, the supervising cardiologist who probably arrived at or about the time when the femoral catheter was inserted. In consequence of the dissection, on 19 June 2009, Mrs C was transferred to another hospital. On 29 June 2009, at that hospital two further stents were inserted into Mrs C's arterial system. She was discharged on 6 July 2009.'<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 'When giving evidence Mrs C said that after the procedure began she felt an severe pain in her right arm of which she complained to the medical staff. She said that she heard the  doctor , Dr M say  ""is she 32 or 52?"" and she said, ""I'm 52, ..why does this matter?"" to which Dr M replied that younger women usually go into spasm if it is put in the arm. He then said, ""We'll go in her leg instead"" to which Mrs C said ""I don't want you to"" to which Dr M answered, ""It won't take long as we've put it in your leg now."" Mrs C said that she was confused and afraid and that she had lost confidence in the ability of the staff to carry out the procedure painlessly and repeatedly said, ""I need this to stop now."" Dr M said, ""I've seen one side and the artery's clear and looks good, I just need to get round the other side. It shouldn't take a minute."" Mrs C said, ""I don't want you to, I need this to stop now. …'I then experienced the most excruciating pain of my life across my back and my chest and my jaw."" She said in her evidence before me that in the course of the procedure he was calm, reassuring, sought to put her at her ease and seemed ""fine in his attitude.""<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Mrs C'a case was that Dr M should have abandoned the procedure after she complained of pain in her right arm that was consistent with spasm. She told him at that stage that she wanted it to stop and if he had done so she would not subsequently have agreed to it being continued, whatever the  doctor  had said to her, and the dissection would not therefore have occurred. She withdrew her  consent for the procedure to continue before access was attempted via the femoral route and that she did not complain of ""excruciating"" pain until after access to her arterial system had been gained by the femoral route'.<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The crux of Mrs C's case was that:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 1.  She did not provide valid consent for the angiogram as she was provided with misleading information before the commencement of the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 2.  Secondly, that she withdrew such consent as she had given before access via the femoral route was undertaken and it was only after this time that she sustained a dissection of the LAD.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The defendant hospital maintained that:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 1.  It did not provide misleading information overall. Even if it was misleading, they claimed, it did not vitiate her consent. They do not admit consent was withdrawn during the procedure.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 2.  They assert that at the material time, Mrs C did not have capacity to withdraw consent and therefore any apparent withdrawal of consent was not valid. Mrs C asserts, however, that at the time she withdrew consent she was fully conscious and aware of events such that she could withdraw her consent. In particular she says the medication she received would not have been sufficient to have affected her capacity. The Defendant also asserts that an event that threatened Mrs C's life occurred before withdrawal of her consent such that the staff of the hospital were entitled to ignore any suggestion from her that she wished them.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Had Mrs C withdrawn consent?

1224	277	1	"You are up early, kirked!   Or else a long way around the globe.      And strangely, the timing of your post says you came after Silverfox, when the content  looks as if they were replying to yours.   Another board glitch?  I'll ask the IT gurus.<br /><br /> But anyway, it has always been my understanding that someone who has been premedicated cannot give consent, which in the current practice of admission as late as possible before operation denies some nervous people of that opportunity.   Once a patent is anaesthetised, the question of withdrawing thir consent does not arise, and it's a pity that the UK has not followed the practice of other countries, or that of dental surgery, in allowing the operator to supervise sedation.    <br /><br /> Because I sympathise with the operator.    They have nearly completed the procedure - to withdraw now wastes time, effort, cost and will expose the patient to the same risk on a second occasion, doubling that risk.  If some one else were at the head-end, who could more closley reassure the anxious patient, thier anxiety might not overload, and equally there might be fewer overdoses.  I admire the reassurance skills of nurses, but they cannot titrate doses of sedatives, only give them on instruction, in this situation from the distracted operator.<br /><br /> For it is difficult to say that a patient asking, telling you to stop cannot withdraw their consent, even if they are sedated.  The effect of benzodiazepines is similar to that of alcohol, they 'disinhibit' the patient.  So the repressed office worker becomes a sexual pest at the Xmas office party, and the patient who has their anxiety under control loses it when sedated and stressed by the procedure.    Silverfox, for this reason I don't agree that  ""Versed"" (AKA UK  midazolam) is an excellent drug, and fentanyl is one that few understand.     While rapid in effect and apparently offset too, it is actually one of the slowest drugs to be excreted.  In small dose this doesn't matter, even when the excretion half life is about six hours, but give more than a little and you run into problems.     ALWAYS have naloxone and flumazenil to hand, but remember that the half life of naloxone is much, much less than fentanyl.<br /><br /> Anaesthetists might more likely to use a propofol infusion with either alfentanyl which has a much shorter half life, or remifentanyl which is so quickly broken down that it too must be given by infusion.   This technique is more flexible and less likely to overdose the patient.     The alfentanyl and propofol combination is used in the UK in Emergency Departments for sedation for dislocation reduction and other painful procedures.    By adopting strict guidelines it has proved successful and safe, despite the alarmist concerns of anaesthetists, including this one, but as far as I know has not been used in cardiology labs.<br /><br /> John"	John D	2016-01-06 08:42:00	0	0
1225	277	1	"We'll have to wait for Kirked to give the judge's ruling but this sort of detailed discussion of a dilemma shows how the apparent clearcut theory of consent may not be not so clear in the messy world of clinical practice.<br /><br /> Although I've myself repeated the training mantra of 'stop when the patient says stop' it's not as black and white as suggested by SILVRFOX (even though I feel at one with him because of the name which has also been applied to me!)  Whistle-blowing by other staff should not occur in a functional team where each member is properly and fully involved and where decisions are properly discussed.  Even then the final responsibility ends up being with one person rather than distributed.<br /><br /> There's an additional risk to the ones listed by John D.  There are times in many procedures when, to stop, would risk a serious or fatal occurrence.  Imagine, for example, the colonoscopic removal of a large polyp using snare diathermy.  When half way through the stalk it's not usually an option to abandon the procedure, one has to finish safely without rushing.  Similarly, with coronary procedures, I imagine that it could be disastrous to withdraw as a stent is being deployed to treat a lesion likely to cause an imminent complete blockage of a coronary artery.  Whilst the patient might well claim later to have had full capacity, it's quite possible that they could claim the opposite if the procedure was abandoned and the patient suffered serious harm. <br /><br /> It's these decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and with competing risks that make these detailed cases valuable for all clinicians to consider.<br /><br /> The original consent is another topic but I would suggest it's impossible for patients to make a fully informed decision if the operator describes a general position of "" In skilled and experienced hands problems are uncommon"" rather than giving their own results."

1226	277	1	"Maxim - and during a procedure such as colonoscopy , there is the added issue of whether the patient is really making an informed decision particularly when a benzodiazepine has been used. I recall the evening ward round with a youngish women complaining that she had not yet had her procedure , when we had curtailed this hours before at her request.<br /><br /> As regards the big polyps : an anecdote , I recall being persuaded by a surgical colleague to ""have a go""  at a vast beast (4cms+)in an elderly man. Half way through I chickened out of this very firm , very thick stalk , dismantled the snare and came out with a view to seeking surgical help. Encouraged to keep going (if you can do it it will save the patient from surgery which may kill him) I went back in and using another snare all went well. Not perhaps now , when there is so much experience of when and how to tackle these things , but there have been times when I think cardiac monitoring advisable for the operator rather than for the patient?<br /><br />   The realisation of slipping out of one's depth mid procedure is of great educational value but there is a problem if it happens too often."	sken	2016-01-09 15:35:00	0	0

1228	277	1	"SILVRFOX - Sounds excellent advice but the problem is when the tricky events arise. There is a big - and i think to some extent unresolved issue around sedation. The anaesthesia recomendations are not ideal when involved in what is essentially terminal care. In those circumstances I think one has to be prepared to step outside eg give adequate pain relief but know how to give it. This was not infrequent a problem when stenting oesophageal malignancy. Awaiting amaesthetic cover for the procedure may mean postponing it (nil by mouth etc... ) for a week , which can be an appreciable proportion of remaining life and stopping the patient returning home. So one also needs education on how to break the excellent safety rules : the harm can be in NOT going ahead or leaving the patient in distress? <br /><br />  I recall one patient - treated by laser elsewhere - where much of the mediastinum had been damaged - the gullet lumen just led into a gaping hole shared with both main bronchi. Of course one could have come out and postponed everything but the sensible course of action seemed to be to slip a stent in whilst keeping the patient comfortable. It seemed to work. How should I have interpreted ""Do no harm"" - discontinue ? Not give analgaesia if the patient had pain? <br /><br /> All eventualities cannot be foreseen although this is less of a problem now. Part of teaching fundamentals is so that the doctor can make decisions when a new scenario emerges. As a general observation our guidelines aim at a medical version of safety - but sometimes the patient may be just as concerned with pain relief , something which is often neglected."	sken	2016-01-10 17:28:00	0	0

1230	277	1	"Many thanks for the responses thus far. May I just add part of Dr M's statement directly relevant to the issue of IV sedation and the possible problems with terminating the procedure (in line with comments already posted):<br /><br /> ""I do not recall Mrs  C requesting the procedure to stop at this point. However, the procedure had now turned into a medical emergency and I was not concentrating on conversations with Mrs  C, but rather was concentrating on saving her life and ensuring that all necessary analgesics and sedatives were provided to make her as comfortable as possible in the circumstance. It is possible that Mrs  C asked for the procedure to stop due to the pain of predominantly the blocked coronary artery, and also secondarily due to the radial spasms. If Mrs  C had asked for the procedure to stop it would not have been possible to do so at this stage without catastrophic and life threatening consequences. I do not recall feeling at any point that Mrs  C was ""withdrawing consent"" and I would certainly recall if this was the case. I do not undertake any invasive procedure without consent unless it is a lifesaving emergency situation. In this case, Mrs  C was in a critical situation very soon after the start of the procedure and needed rapid emergency treatment. In this situation it is my job, and the job of the nurses, to try and relieve the patient of any pain and reassure them. I note that intravenous diazepam, midazolam and morphine were administered to Mrs  C to provide pain relief and to give sedation. We had a low threshold to give sedative and opiate analgesics intravenously for pain in the catheterisation lab in 2009. We would give as much analgesia as needed and the dose may vary between individuals. Mrs  C received multiple doses of diazepam, midazolam and morphine. My  angiogram  report says a total of 13mg morphine and 6mg of diazepam was administered soon after Mrs  C experienced pain. As these are given intravenously, their effect is almost instantaneous. It is standard practice for the nurses to be talking to the patient throughout the  angiogram  procedure and explain what is happening, as the operator is under great pressure and needs to make very important decisions quickly. However, explaining what is happening to a patient who is in pain and under the influence of the above mentioned drugs is very difficult. I note that that Mrs  C says that she believes she may have lost consciousness and she states that her recollection of events is patchy. The diazepam and morphine could have caused her to have a period of no recollection/ 13mg of morphine is a high dose for patient not accustomed to taking morphine and 6mg of diazepam is enough to make a person of low body weight such as Mrs  C very sleepy'.<br /><br /> kirked"	kirked	2016-01-11 17:06:00	0	0

1232	278	1	I have frequently reported medical law cases. Perhaps some may be interested in what was probably the first reported case concerning malpractice. This case was reported in 1829. Thomas Wakley was the defendant but only because he reported on an operation in his new medical journal, the Lancet. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> In March 1828 The Lancet published a Hospital Report entitled ‘The operation of lithotomy by Mr Bransby Cooper which lasted nearly one hour!’, and consisted of an alarming description of a hopelessly incompetent attempt on the part of Bransby Cooper to remove a bladder calculus from a strong and healthy patient who died shortly after the operation. Not only did Cooper lose his way anatomically, he lost his head, and his panicky use of multiple instruments, and his barked and desperate orders to his assistants were observed by a number of his surgical colleagues. Cooper was only appointed a Surgeon because of his connections. Wakley was clear in the Lancet to state that Cooper was a poor surgeon and would not have been appointed but for nepotism. He went on to describe the operation.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The report described an intensely melodramatic account of the operation itself, presented as a theatrical ‘tragedy’ in two acts. ‘Act 1’ opened with a description of the patient, Stephen Pollard, an apparently healthy labourer from Sussex. After he was placed on the table and bound (because there was no anaesthetic) Mr Callaway, Cooper's assistant, held the straight staff while Cooper attempted to make an incision in Pollard's perineum. The opening made, ‘forceps were now handed over and for some time attempted to be introduced, but without effect’. Cooper, declaring that the aperture was not sufficient, allegedly called for ‘my uncle's knife’ to widen it. The forceps were then reintroduced and ‘pushed onwards to a considerable distance, and with no small degree of force’. The first act closed with Cooper declaring that Pollard's perineum was ‘very deep’ and that he could not reach the bladder with his finger.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> ‘Act 2’ opened in even more dramatic fashion, with Pollard subjected to 'such a horrific and invasive assault as to defy syntactic coherence:  The staff re-introduced and cutting gorget passed along it – various forceps employed: a blunt gorget – a scoop – sounds and staves introduced at the opening in the perineum.’ ‘I really can't conceive the difficulty,’ Cooper declared, before asking one of his attendants if they had a longer finger than his own so that they might reach the stone. ‘Good God,’ he exclaimed ‘the forceps won't touch it – O dear! O dear!’<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 'Such were the hurried exclamations of the operator every now and then there was a cry of Hush! which was succeeded by the stillness of death, broken only by the horrible squash, squash of the forceps in the perineum'. By this time Pollard was in unimaginable pain and repeatedly begged Cooper to stop and let his stone ‘keep in’. Cooper persisted, however, and after nearly an hour he finally managed to extract it. With Pollard still bound to the table, Cooper proceeded to address his audience, declaring, once more, that he could not ‘conceive of the difficulty’. Finally the ‘exhausted’ Pollard was put to bed and though he initially ‘rallied’, ‘death ended the poor fellow's sufferings, about 29 hours after the operation’.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The publication of the report and its subsequent notice in The Times caused an immediate sensation. Wakley stated inter Alia '....the real issue was not Cooper's private character, it was whether he performed the late operation with that degree of skill, which the public has a right to expect from a surgeon of Guy's Hospital … whether the unfortunate patient lost his life … because 'it was the turn of a surgeon to operate, who is indebted for his elevation to the influence of a corrupt system, and who … would never have been placed in a situation of such deep responsibility as that which he now occupies, had he not been the nephew of Sir Astley Cooper. This is … the only question, in which the public is interested'.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Wakley then  reconfigured the report as more a systemic critique rather than personal defamation. Although the word libel had been bandied around, there was as yet no clear indication that Cooper would seek legal redress. Even so, Wakley positively invited the prospect. ‘Whether this investigation be of a judicial character or not, we are indifferent,’ he claimed, with feigned insouciance. What was unquestionable was that there would be an investigation, not into Wakley's actions or the harm that had been done to Cooper's reputation, but rather into what ‘Mr Harrison, the treasurer of Guy's Hospital, knows … [are] the extraordinary circumstances attending his elevation to his present situation’. Like Wooler, Hone and others before him, Wakley was preparing to turn the situation to his advantage, to transform the courtroom into an arena for the articulation of radical discourse. Defying his legally allotted role as defendant by electing to act as his own counsel, it was a drama in which he would take centre stage.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The trial was heard promptly and began on 12 December 1828 in the Court of the Queens Bench before Lord Tenterden. Cooper was represented by Sir James Scarlett (a notorious opponent of the popular press and frequent target of radical satire).  Wakley defended himself and conducted his defence with great skill and made the important point that not only should hospitals aspire to the highest standards of care, but mechanisms should be in place to ensure that standards are set and met. Wakeley's belief in the rightness of his cause made him a difficult witness to shake under Scarlett's aggressive cross-examination. Much of Scarlett's defence of Bransby Cooper relied - probably inadvisedly - on the fact that he had been chosen by Astley Cooper as someone fit to practise at Guy's. Scarlett attempted to discredit Mr Lambert, The Lancet reporter, but Wakeley was able to produce Cooper's assistant at the operation Mr Calloway, who confirmed the precise details that had been reported in The Lancet. After a long case the jury deliberated for two hours and returned a verdict for the plaintiff, but for damages of only £100. This was another triumph for Wakeley and The Lancet, and was recognized nationally as a landmark case. Wakley's  legal costs amounted to over £400, and this amount was quickly raised by public subscription, with the excess funds being forwarded to the widow of Cooper's unfortunate patient, whose bladder calculus has been preserved in the Gordon Museum at King's Hospital. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked	kirked	2015-12-30 15:52:00	0	0

1234	279	1	Two Nurses have been sent to prison for falsifying patient results. Between them, three Nurses (the third received a community order) they faked 81 blood glucose results. Most of the patients had had a stroke and were having their blood sugar assessed two hourly. They said pressure of work and dissatisfaction played a part in their 'wilful neglect'. One nurse felt she could catch up later with the sugar measurements.<br /><br />  <br /><br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-35090879<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The Judge said 'I pause to remind myself that you all would have seen worried relatives coming and going, sitting with their mothers, fathers or spouses as they lay ill, some approaching the end of their lives, and to wonder with bemusement how you could have continued to betray your patients and those families as you did....This was not a failure to do your job, it was a failure of compassion and humanity. This was clear-eyed and calculated deception, the purpose of which was to make the defendants' working time easier. There was also... a real risk to health, even if that risk happily did not materialise'.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> I make no particular comment about this case which is specifically concerned with wilful neglect but am interested whether criminalising medical error or mistakes (quite different to the case at hand) is a deterrent to poor or dangerous practice? Most mistakes I see are not deliberate or calculated. Most often there is a momentary slip or perhaps poor judgement. Does criminal punishment deter error by others? Most Doctors are trying to do the right thing but often organisational or system failures are the underlying culprit. Criminal law is concerned with punishment, retribution and deterrence. A criminal investigation and trial could be catastrophic for a Doctor irrespective of the outcome.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Contrary to common perception there is no real evidence that criminal prosecutions of Doctors and Nurses has increased (publicity has certainly increased).  Nor is there evidence that high profile cases over the last decade or so have improved patient safety or accountability. In the well known case of Drs Prentice and Sullman, the fatal mistake of accidentally administering vincristine into a patient’s spine arose again a few years later resulting in the death of an eighteen-year old outpatient, Wayne Jowett, who had been in remission from leukemia. It was reported to be the thirty-sixth incident of a fatal injection of vincristine worldwide.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Furthermore, I am pretty sure that fear of litigation discourages the open admission of error.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Certainly there are cases where criminal prosecution is exactly appropriate. Absolute recklessness or deliberately causing harm must surely merit prosecution. But such cases, thankfully are rare. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked	kirked	2015-12-14 18:09:00	0	0
1235	279	1	"As you point out, kirked, the more usual 'medical mistake' is completely different from the recent case, of wilful neglect.  Instead, many are due to a decison or choice made in a pressured situation, or are the result of the holes in the Swiss Cheese Model all lining up: http://patientsafetyed.duhs.duke.edu/module_e/swiss_cheese.html<br /><br /><br /><br /> The vincristine story is a dreadfully good example, and while solutions or more permutations of the cheese slices are now available, they are very slowly taken up.      'Safety' spinal needles, that have the Luer connections reversed so that only a special syringe can be connected, are now available.    Anaesthetists, who although they never use vincristine must use more spinal needles than any other specialty, felt that standardising on these needles would provide that further layer in the cheese, with less chance of the vincristine getting through.  https://www.aagbi.org/sites/default/files/Neuraxial%20position%20statement.pdf<br /><br /> My own Department made this change and removed ordinary spinal needles from use, pour encourager les autres, but as far as I know, local oncology departments have not, and I can find no paper that documents the take-up in oncology of this measure.  I fear that a thirty-seventh spinal vincristine injection is bound to happen sometime soon.     Should the doctor who gives it be pilloried?    I don't think so, but the Director of that oncology unit should be.<br /><br /> The WHO surgical checklist was intended to prevent the many ""Never"" events that can and do occur - wrong side, wrong operation, wrong patient, retained objects etc. http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/checklist/en/  and I can say  in my own practice that the procedure has prevented mistakes, but there is no evidence of its value.   Unsurprising, when audits that have been done have found it was used in as little as a third of operations.     Indeed, the Cochrane system has been able to find only two reports in the world on wrong site surgery that satisfy their criteria.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25821069<br /><br />  When organsiations ignore potential safety measures, which even when introduced are not implemented or not auditted, what hope has the individual that their momentary inattention will not damage their patient?<br /><br /> John"	John D	2015-12-15 10:50:00	0	0

1237	279	1	It can't be right to criminalise someone, usually careful, who never knew about the risk there's the rub.  How is it that the same sort of disastrous mistake can occur over and over again when equipment change/ban would make it almost impossible to occur.  A similar thing happened with the inadvertent intravenous injection of strong potassium solution which had been mistaken for something innocuous.  I think it would be difficult now to find amoules of strong potassium available in any clinical areas but I may be wrong.  At what point could the legal system expect and require that every clinician is aware of the risk and that counter measures are universally available?  If that were the case then I could understand how criminal liablity might follow such a mistake being made again in contravention of known safety rules.<br /><br /> Many doc2doc members will remember the fanfare, some years ago, that accompanied an expert group publication titled 'An organisation with a memory'  This group was chaired by the CMO Liam Donaldson who was very keen to use the Swiss cheese analogy to explain how events lined up to produce a serious problem.  The paper was designed to address and explain how adverse events need to be prevented and it included the usual list of methods but didn't seem to consider how lessons (if ever learned in the first place) can so quickly be forgotten by organisations and may never be passed on reliably to future generations of clinicians.  It is true to say that parts of the NHS have even forgotten the existence of 'An organisation with a memory'.  A sort of organisational dementia perhaps?<br /><br /> I'm not sure where an organisational memory even resides and how it should exist apart from in written or computer records, both of which gather dust very quickly.  Seniors can pass on cautionary tales to successive generations of trainees but stable teams are becoming rarer.  Theoretically these lessons should accumulate and be drummed into every practitioner during every procedural training but that is not universal.<br /><br /> I suppose that's all a lengthy way of saying that organisations and individuals have to share responsibilities and punishments for repeating preventable errors.  'Defensive Medicine' has always been used as a derogatory term but I increasingly feel sympathy for those who practice it.  Even if criminal convictions haven't increased much, the intense publicity has and is in every doctor's face every day.

Equally it took me a while to appreciate that from a managerial viewpoint it was the current implementation that counted - after all the whole aim might change in another direction in the near future. This need to live in the here and now made memory irrelevant.<br /><br /> The potassium really was a sorry saga - ampoules almost identical to NaCl yet with dire consequences in the event of a mix-up.

1240	279	1	John, sken, Maxim,<br /><br /> In some countries criminalisation of medical mistakes is routine. Switzerland is a good example and I believe in Thailand medical error is always criminal. In the UK medical negligence only becomes a crime if the patient dies.   A health care professional can make the most egregious error and yet escape criminal liability if the patient survives. When a patient does die, death could have been caused by many factors frequently making it nigh on impossible to determine whether the suspect was the, or even a substantial, ‘cause’ of death.  To put it crudely one might also say there is an element of luck involved whether an individual Doctor faces criminal charges; the patient may survive although be seriously harmed or some event might supervene to break the chain of causation. 'Medical manslaughter' or, more accurately, Gross negligence manslaughter is an ill defined concept which prosecutors, judges and juries all struggle with.  The test for gross negligence manslaughter is an ‘objective’ one, there need be no evidence of subjective culpability. Such problems have led to calls to raise the bar of liability by, for example, creating a subjective recklessness test or a more substantive test for ‘gross negligence. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> For decades in the legal system there has been debate about the place of negligence in criminal liability in general. The classic view is that mala in se (real crimes) require subjective knowledge or intent, and that negligence should be the basis of liability only for mala prohibita (behaviours that are not intrinsically bad). Thus negligence is, according to this argument, an unsuitable basis for liability for serious crimes such as manslaughter.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Others support the imposition of criminal sanctions for those who were negligent on the basis that a defendant could have complied with proper standards of conduct expected of a reasonable Dr but did not do so - this approach does not, in my view, take into account system and process failures and also seems to suggest a deliberate effort not to comply. Legal academics enjoy discussing these legal specifics but frequently fail to realise that it is Doctors practising medicine in less than perfect conditions who have to manage uncertainty and risk who may come a cropper for a minor mishap but suffer emotionally and professionally forever.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Patient groups insist that because the 'Organisation with a Memory'' work was so influential it has had the effect of ensuring blame is never apportioned to individuals when it rightly should be. They say they are weary of press conferences where Trust Director's says 'lessons have been learned' and wider system failures are blamed (I do have some sympathy with their concerns). They point to Mid Staffs as an example where patient care was abysmal and no management figure or senior Dr or Nurse seemed to be held to account.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> When trusts operate with so many Agency Nurses and Locums or too few staff it must be clear that the organisational memory just isn't there. No matter how strict and superb policies and procedures are unless staff know them and follow them there isn't much that can be done.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Defensive Medicine is always deemed to be negative. Whilst it pushes up costs (hugely in the US) one can hardly blame Doctors for doing what they can to allay legal problems. The media barrage 'consumers' with adverts implying that every injury or illness is someone's fault and must be compensatable.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> There is a movement in the US (the name eludes me at the moment) encouraging Drs not to practise defensively because, they say,  it is unethical and erodes the Dr/pt relationship (the focus of clinical practice may shift from the patient’s well-being to one of legal self-protection for the doctor) and utilisation of scarce healthcare resources for non therapeutic use results in other pts being unable to access healthcare they need promptly.

The problem these two innocent nurses experienced could have happened to anyone in any hospital.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The hospital’s computerised blood glucometer records differed from what the nurses had written in the records. It was therefore alleged the two nurses had falsified patient records.<br /><br />Once the police start exploring the vast amount of electronic records in a hospital, it is almost inevitable they will find problems. It just takes one complaint to start the process, and staff suspensions and arrests then follow with horrible predictability. It took three years of police work to bring this case to trial, and there was a vast amount of evidence, both paper and electronic.<br /><br />The prosecution believed the computer records were a true and complete record.<br /><br />The defense argued that the electronic data’s integrity and provenance was not reliable; in fact the data had been manipulated. Because there was no auditing in the data trail, showing the data was unreliable was a complex technical process.<br /><br />The pre-trial review consisted of two weeks of cross-examination of the expert witness and others in order to work through the reliability of the evidence.<br /><br />In his ruling the judge said that presenting unreliable evidence to the jury would be misleading, and he therefore excluded it.

Her younger sister, who has two children of her own, is prepared to donate an egg to her. Mrs A is close to her sister and they worship at the same church, so see each other reguarly.<br /><br /> The clinicians caring for her at the Fertility Centre are divided on the question of whether or not Mrs A's siter has a righ to know her sister's HIV status? Mrs A is admant that her sister is not told, particualry as she recognises that the IVF treatment proposed has probably only a 10% chance of success in her case.<br /><br /> Discuss the ethical and legal issues	Tom Axon	2015-11-23 22:07:00	0	0
1243	280	1	Tom<br /><br /> Can you give some more information on a couple of points that might have a bearing on any answer to this interesting question.  I don't know much about the details of this procedure.<br /><br /> 1)  What would the best chance of success be in this procedure and is the 10% primarily because of the HIV infection and any treatment being given for it?  Does treatment carry risk to the foetus?<br /><br /> 2) I presume that egg harvesting has a small risk to the donor and I wonder if you can tell us that risk.<br /><br /> I doubt that the donor has any general right to know her sister's HIV status but her altruism might have limits if the risk to herself wasn't seen to be justified by the very low chance ot successful pregnancy for her sister.  In that case she might have a claim to know that, for reasons undisclosed, the chance of success was very low.<br /><br /> You mention, in passing, that the sisters 'worship at the same church'.    Were you hinting that the donor's religious beliefs might have a bearing on her decision to donate if she was aware of all the facts.<br /><br /> In summary, I wouldn't think the donor has an absolute right to information about the recipient's health details and that eggs should probably be freely given (eg like blood) without other knowledge unless this affected the donor's judgement of the level of personal risk that would be acceptable to her.  This judgement might well be different according to whether the recipient is a sibling or someone unknown.

1245	282	1	This case was resolved recently and I thought others might find it interesting. It is a terribly sad case where a very close family suffered disaster following an act of altruism.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Mr A had been undergoing renal dialysis for several years and was on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. His son Mr B (age 35) was anxious to give his father the opportunity of a better quality of life in his well earned retirement by donating his right kidney. This he duly did. However, the operation was carried out negligently - and to a degree recklessly. Proceedings against the surgeon by the GMC were undertaken.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The consequences of the negligent surgery  have been catastrophic for Mr B and his family: physically, psychologically, emotionally and financially. Although the patient's right kidney was successfully removed and transplanted, Mr B suffered irreversible failure of the left kidney. In fact he should never have been advised to undergo the operation at all given the grave dangers involved. That negligent advice was compounded by serial mistakes during the operation itself. Mr B's life was saved only after many hours on the operating table during which he received over 100 units of blood and fluid transfusions.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> During the course of the operation Mr B suffered a Myocardial  Infarction; ischaemic damage to the lumbo-sacral plexus and an Inferior Vena Cava thrombosis. He was left in total renal failure. He was in hospital for nearly two months, during which he started to receive haemodialysis three times a week. He also developed a serious drug induced confusional disorder. This treatment affected him profoundly. He became severely depressed, frequently contemplating suicide. He contracted serious infections, one of which necessitated a further admission to hospital. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Mr B's own act of altruism in donating a kidney to his father, which cost him so dear, was reciprocated by his sister. She donated a kidney to Mr B at very considerable psychological and emotional cost. That operation was successful. It released the claimant from an indefinite regime of dialysis. However, he lives with the constant fear that his body will reject the kidney and it is common ground that when he reaches his early sixties that kidney will require replacement. This uncertainty, and his experiences generally, have left him with an understandable obsession about his health.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Unfortunately a recurrent infection was imported with his sister's kidney - Cytomegalovirus.  This is a constant source of worry.  He has been advised that his renal failure increases significantly the risk that he will suffer from ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Consequently he adopts a very careful lifestyle and diet. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels which cause him constant worry. The immuno-suppressant drugs he takes, in particular to control the CMV, greatly increase the risk of his developing other debilitating and life threatening conditions. The consequence is that he has become fastidious to the point of obsessional about personal and general hygiene, which impacts upon the whole family. He can be irritable and overbearing. He is prone to bouts of weeping.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> There are further serious physical consequences. The nerve damage suffered during the negligent operation has resulted in altered sensation below the right knee. There is hyper-sensitivity, pain and loss of sensation in various parts of the right foot, and clawing of the first and second toes. He has had surgery on the first toe. Further surgery had been planned to straighten and fuse the toes but this may be avoided by regular injection of botulinum toxin for life. The issue surrounding this problem with his foot has a bearing on his residual earning capacity. Currently he is unable to run, and walking on uneven ground and stairs presents some difficulty.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Mr B has also been much distressed by urinary difficulties. For a time self- catheterisation was attempted. He found it a dreadful experience. Urinary frequency bedevils his daily life, and results in broken nights for him and for his wife. The medication he takes has had unpleasant side-effects including the profuse growth of unwanted body hair, the development of skin acneiform lesions and the deposit of facial and abdominal fat. His inability to exercise has also led to undesirable weight gain. Prior to the operation, the claimant was a healthy, fit and active 35 year old man. He took great pride in his health and fitness, running several kilometres each morning to set himself up for the working day. He had enormous energy. He was cheerful, optimistic and extrovert. Now the picture is very different. At the age of 39 his daily life revolves around his health worries. He is constantly fearful of infection or changes which may increase the risk of the kidney being rejected. Any venturing from the strictly enforced hygiene of the home is fraught with anxiety. He lives with the certain knowledge that the kidney will require replacement by the time he reaches the age of 61 and that this will be preceded by symptoms of progressive renal failure. It is agreed that his life expectancy has been reduced by 10 years.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Mr B  is a shadow of his former self. He is lacking in energy. He is exhausted by 9 pm and generally has to be in bed by 10 pm. He is moody and irritable. His marriage, though very strong, is constantly under strain. The children have been affected and distressed by their father's condition and behaviour and he has bridges to build there.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Prior to the transplant Mr B was a very successful and well paid executive on the verge of setting up his own company.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> After a long and extremely complex process of financial assessment for damages and estimated projection for future loss of earnings and medical expenses Mr B was awarded the following:<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Item Amount                                                                                Judgment<br /><br /> General damages                                                                        £168,000 <br /><br /> Past losses inclusive of interest                                                   £287,500 <br /><br /> Future losses (other than earnings and medical expenses)        £432,500 <br /><br /> Medical expenses & treatment                                                     £167,757 <br /><br /> Loss of earnings to the age of 65                                                 £4,580,869 <br /><br /> Loss of earnings after the age of 65                                             £68,891 <br /><br /> Deduction for residual earning capacity                                [less£164,108] <br /><br /> Capital loss of sale of the business                                              £1,199,237 <br /><br /> Total award                                                                                   £6,740,646 <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked	kirked	2015-11-03 04:05:00	0	0
1246	282	1	There are 2 separate issues here. Just what happened during the first donation - was this carried out in an appropriate unit and by a suitably accredited surgeon? It sounds as though there were problems from the very beginning - just who assessed Mr B as a suitable donor and how far were they to blame as well as the surgeon ?<br /><br /> The second donation raises a separate issue . Specifically were the protocols for screening +/- treatment for CMV followed ? Generally , should recipients be given an option on whether to receive a kidney ? There are from time to time cases where a malgnancy seems to have been transferred by donation and there are presumably patients where there are additional risks or the donor has some additional risk factors. But should the patient be given the option - particularly an older patient ? <br /><br /> Off-hand I cannot recall a sadder tale of medical disaster following such admirable altruism within a family.<br /><br /> On a legal point , it seems quite likely this chap will not reach 65 : does the award for loss of earnings after the age of 65 have to be returned?	sken	2015-11-03 11:21:00	0	0
1247	282	1	May I divert to thread a little, if only to avert my gaze from such a disaster?<br /><br /> About twenty-five years ago, I cared for a child, quadraplegic and ventilator dependent after an RTA.    She sued the driver for damages, and got a similar sum.     But some was money paid into a trust, so that it generated the income she needed for care etc.     That trust ended when, sad but invitably to say, she died before reaching her twentieth birthday. <br /><br /> I was told at the time that this was a new way of settling damages.    It seemed fair to me that she and the family should be compensated properly for the damage to their lives, and that the insurance company should not have to support the family beyond the death of thier unfortunate child.   I've never heard of another case, but then I haven't been involved with anything similar.    Would a portion of  this poor man's damages have been paid into a trust?<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-11-03 13:25:00	0	0
1248	282	1	John D- I think there have been some other cases similar to the example you give. But it is different when an adult has dependents who may need support beyond the death of the original patient. So one might have to take those and their earning potential into account. The cynic might argue that the lawyers will solve the problem by dividing up whatever is left amongst themselves during endless lawsuits. (There are equally cynical comments made about the medical profession at times).	sken	2015-11-03 15:13:00	0	0
1249	282	1	Many thanks sken and John,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> I hope this is helpful as regards the financial aspects of your questions.  Until the late 1980's  damages were paid in a lump sum. It did not matter that the compensation was for losses that might be suffered in the future: both the monthly wage that the accident/negligence victim may have lost, and the continuing costs of care that would have to be met, were compensated by one large payment. This could be problematic for the claimant (patient). The responsibility for investing the money wisely is significant. When a defendant agrees a lump sum rather than a periodic payment settlement, they are also offloading considerable financial risk onto the claimant. While the scale of lump sum payments in serious injury cases can make them seem like giant windfalls, they also carry with them a range of financial risks. For example, inflation will gradually erode the value of the payment and returns on lump sum investments may be taxed, while the income paid by an annuity is tax free. These risks can be mitigated with expert financial planning, but the elephant in the room - the mortality risk - cannot. If the claimant lives longer than predicted, there is the very real danger that the money awarded in a lump sum will run out.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> A structured settlement usually takes the following form. The defendant's insurer, having agreed a lump sum figure, will arrange to convert part of that sum into a series of periodic payments “structured” to accommodate the claimant’s individual needs. To fund the arrangement, the liability insurer purchases annuities from a life office, and assigns the benefit of them to the claimant. However, NHS Trusts may prefer to self fund settlements (see below). The arrangement clearly can be especially advantageous financially if there is dispute about the claimant’s life expectancy.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Because settlements from trusts ultimately derive from the public purse there are an increasing number of cases where payments made are recouped upon death of the claimant (see  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-22553341 as an example). In Mr B's case if he died earlier than anticipated (which is a very real probability of which the pt is aware) payments would usually stop unless there are dependants reliant upon him - this will usually have been considered in the original settlement.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> As an aside, the government has guaranteed these NHS self-funded structures and claimants can be assured that their future payments are copper-bottomed. However, these savings to the NHS do not accrue without risk to public funds. There is a potential problem involved in the NHS acting as if it were a miniature life insurer by accepting continuing, uncertain, liabilities into the future.  The National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) handles financial and claims responsibility for cases of clinical negligence. It automatically considers the possibility of a structure in any claim which is likely to exceed £250,000 and a few hundred NHS structures have been put in place to date. The concept is particularly attractive to the NHS. However defendant  Trusts can self-fund the continuing payments involved in a structure instead of parting with a lump sum to buy annuities from the insurance market. They can then keep the cash in-house and thus avoid the problems caused by the loss of large capital payments. In the past, the amounts needed for lump sum awards have fluctuated widely, and their payment could have dramatic effects upon health care budgets: major capital expenditure was deferred and even wards closed. Self-funded structures thus make more money available to the NHS in the short term. This is especially attractive to a Government keen to increase the resources immediately available for health care. It is of course debatable whether this really means more resources and services available to patients!<br /><br />  <br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2015-11-04 10:10:00	0	0

1252	282	1	Kirked<br /><br /> The addition of 'recklessly' to the already serious verdict of negligence is intriguing and that implies a whole range of possibilities.  Presumably the verdict would have been the same whether or not the donated kidney was from family member and I had a few, purely personal, thoughts on the altruism aspect of this case.<br /><br /> We know nothing about the dynamics within this family which, tragically, ended up much worse off as a family than if the father had waited for a kidney but I find it difficult to imagine that I would allow any of my children to put their own life at such significant risk if I were in a similar position to the father.  Obviously there are lesser degrees of risk donating blood for example or even bone marrow but the risks of nephrectomy would be beyond consideration.  I stress again that this is purely a personal opinion but I would be interested to read others' views.<br /><br /> Altruism is always a tricky concept.  In this family's case I'm sure it was as pure as it gets but there have certainly been concerns about the wider aspects of family donations in the past.  I once worked as a lecturer/SR on a large London renal unit and we were asked to work up a living donor transplant where the young family member donor was being flown in from abroad.  It didn't take me long to see that the donation was anything but voluntary and informed.  I am pleased that my senior colleagues agreed to halt the process.  I guess the safeguards are much tighter nowadays but I wonder how much of this still occurs.

1253	282	1	"kirked - once again  , many thanks. I have kept your explanation for reference. Maxim I don't expect your renal unit was a vast distance from the Blind Beggar ? Did you come across Rod Dathan who I gather has just died. He was one of the first batch of doctors when the renal unit opened at the London. A psychiatric patient jumped from the top floor and landed on the unit roof. Rod made a comment about their knowing they were waiting for a donor , but never expected him to come through the ceiling. .. Perhaps we should have a thread sometime on the use of sick humour by doctors.<br /><br /> In those early days there was considerable screening of patients for dialysis - I became aware of this whilst working on the psychiatric unit , but I have the impression that everyone is a bit more gung-ho these days. <br /><br /> Just what is it that drives some folk to donate a kidney in an apparently totally altruistic way? Presumably different factors may apply for different folk. I doubt whether the dynamics of within family donations can ever be fully unravelled - I too would not want to accept a donation from offspring , nor would I expect my parents to have accepted one from me - but would have felt donation from paret to offspring as pretty natural . Nor  would I have had any compunction about being a donor for my wife - or do I just say that because compatibility is less likely ? The domino system clearly has considerable self interest involved. <br /><br /> As I have said previously , I am not in favour of the present system of looking at recipients purely on the grounds of ""medical need"" , nor do I think we should encourage Joe Public to see organ donation (or blood transfusion) as a ""right"" without responsibility. I see that there have been some fairly outspoken views from the transplant world of late suggesting essentially that we should re-visit some of the basic ethical issues of how we should use what is essentially a limited resource and which will remain limited even if an opt  out system is adopted."	sken	2015-11-05 12:31:00	0	0

1255	283	1	"12th June 1991<br /><br />Stu  Blue and his wife Pru, (aged 35) got up, had a cigarette and some coffee and Mr Blue left for work at about 7am. On arrival at work (about 7.30am) his wife was already on the phone telling him she felt ill, had chest pain and was very nauseous. He went back home immediately.  On arrival his wife was anxious, hot, still had chest pain and having difficulty breathing. Mr Blue called the GP practice. Dr A said he would be there shortly. A little before his arrival an ambulance had been summoned by Mrs Blue's mother. It arrived before the GP.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Dr A arrived  at about 8.40 a.m. He was not Mrs Blue's normal general practitioner. Indeed, he had not dealt with her before, although her parents were patients of his. She seemed to be having chest pain. He was unsure what the cause was but decided to admit her to hospital with a possible diagnosis of heart attack. Having made that decision the hospital was bound to admit her (his reasoning). He telephoned the Coronary Care Unit at the Royal Infirmary. He told them that Mrs Blue was having severe chest pain. Normally he would write a letter which would go with the patient in the ambulance but he could not recall if in the urgency of the situation he did so on this occasion.  Dr A gave Mrs Blue an injection of nalbuphine.  He could not remember whether and to what extent it had been effective.  Mrs Blue was taken by ambulance to the Coronary Care Unit. Mr Blue followed in a car. When he saw her on CCU she was still distressed but was no longer in pain - it was now 10.45 a.m. She said she had experienced a queer feeling coming over her with tightening in her chest over the heart and pain in her left arm. Mr Blue stayed with her for about an hour and then left so that her parents could see her. He went home.<br /><br />  <br /><br />On her admission an ecg was immediately recorded.  On CCU Dr R had 3 ECGs all timed 8.53am and all he described as normal.  Dr R took a history from Mrs Blue which he noted as follows: ""Severe central chest pain radiating across chest and into back starting at 8.00 a.m. and lasting about 30 minutes. Not radiating to neck. Some 'heaviness' in arms. Associated breathlessness. Pain no longer present. No previous similar pain. No palpitations.""<br /><br />  <br /><br />He then noted Mrs Blue's previous medical history, family history and social history. The only items of significance from a cardiac point of view were a strong family history on her father's side of ischaemic heart disease and that she smoked 15 cigarettes a day. Dr R then carried out a thorough examination of her. He noted that she was ""anxious ++"". She was very upset and crying when he first saw her. There was no evidence of Myocardial  Infarction on the ECG but he asked that it should be repeated in one hour. He also asked for a full blood count, biochemical screening, enzyme tests and a chest x-ray.  Dr R was with Mrs Blue for about 30-45 minutes and was noting his findings as he went along. The notes then went on to a trolley in the ward where all such notes were kept.<br /><br />  <br /><br />The repeat ECG was taken shortly after  midday. The T-waves in leads V1 and V2 were now inverted and those in V3 flat. Dr R and the Consultant Cardiologist  (Dr J) noted the findings but no particular action was taken at that time. On his ward round at about 4.00 p.m. Dr J first saw Mrs Blue. Dr R was with him. So was a member of the nursing staff. Before he saw her he read and considered Dr R's notes of the history and his examination. He was aware of the ECG traces taken at 8.53 a.m. The change in the trace taken at midday had also been drawn to his attention. He regarded it as a slight change which could be due to many causes, only one of which was cardiac disease. He considered that the change was not compatible with acute myocardial infarction. Dr J took a history from Mrs Blue  and examined her. When he saw her she was calm and seemed well. Her vital signs - pulse and blood pressure - were normal. She conversed with Dr J in an articulate way. Nothing that Dr J got from his examination was materially different from what Dr R had found in the morning. Dr J came to the view that Mrs Blue's symptoms were not cardiac in origin but were oesophageal. In order, however, to cover the outside chance that there had been a silent myocardial infarction at some earlier time prior to the event which led to Mrs Blue's admission he asked for the enzyme tests which had been done to be checked. He stated 'that such tests, based on a blood sample taken shortly after the patient's admission, could not reveal whether the pain which had led to her admission was due to a myocardial infarction; it was too soon for that. But if the enzyme tests were normal that Mrs Blue could go home'. He prescribed maalox. He noted all this in the hospital records. Dr R telephoned the laboratory to get the results of the enzyme tests. They were normal. Dr R then wrote the discharge note addressed  the general practitioner. In it he wrote, inter alia: ""No ECG changes"". The diagnosis was given as oesophageal spasm. A fuller, typed report to the general practitioner, giving more detail, followed later.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Dr R phoned Mr Blue and told him that the problem was not heart related but was an oesophageal spasm. On the way home they went and got the maalox. They got home at about 6.00 p.m. Mr Blue got his wife some tea and made her comfortable. She went to bed early, at about 7.00 p.m. An hour or so later she complained of pain in her chest and he reported this to Dr A by telephone. Dr A told him to let him know if there was any further change. Mrs Blue settled for a while but at about 11.00 p.m. complained again, more strongly this time, of chest pain. Mr Blue telephoned Dr A and told him. Dr A came out and examined her. He told Mr Blue that it might be a few days before the pain disappeared. Shortly thereafter Mr Blue retired to bed. At about 4.30 a.m. his wife woke him complaining again of severe pains in the chest. She said she could not bear it. Mr Blue telephoned Dr A who came out again immediately. By the time he arrived Mrs Blue's condition had worsened. She became hysterical then collapsed without a pulse. Dr A told Mr Blue  to call for an ambulance, which he did. In the meantime Dr A started CPR. When the ambulance arrived defibrillation was attempted but without response. Mrs Blue was taken by ambulance to the Accident and Emergency Department in infirmary. From there she was taken to theatre but all attempts at resuscitation failed. She was pronounced dead at 5.50 a.m. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Post mortem examination of the deceased's body revealed the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was severely atheromatous over the proximal 6 cms with 70% occlusion of the lumen and an e-centric plaque. The circumflex branch was also severely atheromatous with up to 90% luminal obliteration. The right coronary artery showed circumferential atheroma with approximately 40% narrowing and 3 cms from the origin there was an area of plaque rupture with associated haemorrhage. Death was due to coronary artery disease. The area of plaque rupture, possibly complicated by overlying thrombus, would have accounted for her presenting symptoms. Mottling found on the myocardium was consistent with a very recent infarction, probably less than 8 hours before death.<br /><br />  <br /><br />Expert medical opinion will follow. The crux of the legal complaint was that it had been negligent to discharge Mrs Blue in light of her presentation, clinical and ECG findings and family history. Further that it was Dr J's duty to keep the deceased in hospital for at least 24 hours, that is, until at least 9.30 a.m. on the following day. <br /><br />  <br /><br />Kirked<br /><br />  <br /><br /> ."	kirked	2015-10-19 14:06:00	0	0
1256	283	1	Kirked<br /><br /> I suspect there will be plenty of responses to this case report and I look forward to any comments from cardiologists.  As I find myself with a bit of time I'll volunteer a few provocative comments to kick off.<br /><br /> Although this occurred over twenty years ago I think you could see the same thought processes and decisions being made today.  Yes, it's easy to be wise in retrospect but this mistake has been made so many times that you might think the lesson could be available to all but still it happens.  Why?<br /><br /> Given that the pain was clearly compatible with a diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease with two strong risk factors and there were changing ECG signs ( the word 'slight' is one of the most dangerous in Medicine) you wonder what thinking justified discharge that same day.  Even today there's often a misunderstanding that normal levels of troponins exclude a serious ischaemic process when they do no such thing.<br /><br /> You could identify several cognitive errors but I suspect one of the most common causes for premature and unsafe discharge is the demand to free beds for other admissions who are often less ill than those being discharged.  Those who pressurise clinicians to make rash decisions are never the ones to appear in court.<br /><br /> Whether this was called negligence was a legal decision but the real shame is that such cases don't result in prevention across the board.  Shades of Medicine vs civil aviation!

1257	283	1	Many thanks Maxim for your thoughts. Your comments about freeing up beds is absolutely correct in this case.<br /><br /> Plaintiff expert medical opinion - Dr Moon Key points:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> He  noted Dr R's examination of the deceased that there was a strong family history on her father's side of ischaemic heart disease and that she was a smoker. These factors increased the likelihood of coronary heart disease even in the case of a woman aged 35, who was basically in a very low probability category for such disease.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Dr Moon thought, however, that the symptoms recorded by Dr R were much more likely to have a cardiac origin than oesophageal, although he accepted that they could be the latter. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The normal ECGs at 8.53 a.m. did not exclude the possibility that a myocardial infarction had occurred at home that morning, and a further ECG in one hour would not do so either. It took longer for  ECG changes to evolve. His practice would be to take a further ECG 24 hours later. It was, however, reasonable practice to repeat the ECG at midday, as had been done. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The changes from the ecg(s) taken at 8.53 a.m. were not diagnostic of heart attack but they did increase the likelihood that the deceased's chest pain was cardiac in origin. They made it more likely that the deceased was suffering from an acute coronary syndrome. Continued observation and further evaluation were therefore required. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The the correct practice in 1991 was to test a small range of enzymes (LDH & AAT) in order to diagnose whether a myocardial infarction had occurred. These enzymes are released from the heart muscle, but only slowly, and are not seen at relevant levels for a number of hours after the suspected myocardial infarction, a minimum of 8 hours but nearer to 12 hours. Therefore the blood sample which enables the enzymes to be tested should not be taken until that period has elapsed, in this case until at earliest the late afternoon on 12 June. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> It was appropriate for Dr J to order enzyme tests to be done and if they were normal, for the deceased to be discharged, but it was inappropriate to base the tests on a blood sample taken at 9.30 that morning. Of the two enzymes tested AAT shows a raised level earlier and reduces to a normal level earlier. LDH takes longer to show a raised level and remains high for longer. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Nevertheless Dr Moon accepted that, although a wrong diagnosis was in fact made in this case, the probability that someone such as the deceased who presents with chest pain but has a normal ECG has actually had a heart attack is low. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Second expert plaintiff opinion - Dr Woods Key points:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The pt was displaying some of the classic symptoms of a cardiac problem and the possibility was that she had had a heart attack.  Oesophageal pain can be almost identical in its symptoms to cardiac pain. However, you cannot prove oesophageal pain and so he said that he would treat her as if she had had a heart attack until he had excluded it. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> He would have admitted her, doing serial ECGs and enzyme level tests. The steps that Dr R took after examining her were appropriate. In particular, it was appropriate to order a later ECG. A normal ECG on admission would not exclude a heart attack but if it had happened, it would show on later ECGs. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The deceased should not have been discharged home on the basis of her chest pain having settled by the time of her admission and the ECGs taken at about that time being normal. That would not have been reasonable, because by that time there was no evidence that her pain was not cardiac in origin. It was essential to do serial ECGs. It would have been negligent not to have done the second ECG, the one done at about midday. Dr Woods accepted that, as a 35 year old woman, the deceased was in a very low risk category for a heart attack and he accepted that chest pain is a common medical emergency. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> With symptoms which were text book of cardiac pain, albeit of oesophageal pain also, no patient should be discharged until cardiac pain had been excluded. This meant that a large number of patients had to be kept in hospital overnight, although not necessarily in the Coronary Care Unit. With advances since 1991, however, enzymes which peak earlier are used for these tests now and so it is possible to turn patients around more quickly.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The  changes in the T-waves on leads V1, V2 and V3 on the ECG trace taken at midday represented a definite change. They were not diagnostic of a cardiac problem but were not due to postural changes on the part of the patient or the positioning of the leads. They could have been due to other non-cardiac causes but on balance would have reinforced his inclination that the problem was cardiac. In any event, there was enough to warrant looking at the matter further. He would therefore have done further ECGs. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The changes in the ECG at midday would have made him more interested in the enzyme levels. Since the AAT enzyme would peak at 12-24 hours after any heart attack (sooner than LDH), that would mean that it should be measured from a blood sample taken not less than 12 hours after the suspected heart attack. That would have meant that the deceased should have been kept in hospital until at least 8.00 p.m. on 12 June for the blood sample to be taken and then some time after that to await the result. The deceased should not have been sent home before the results of these enzyme tests were known. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> He was highly critical of Dr J's decision to send her home when he did. He interpreted Dr J's diagnosis of oesophageal spasm as implying that he had excluded a cardiac cause of the problem. But in his view it certainly had not been excluded. If Dr J had seen the trace of the ECG done at midday he had either failed to observe the change or missed its significance.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> (Further evidence to follow)<br /><br />  <br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2015-10-20 08:00:00	0	0
1258	283	1	Plaintiff witness Dr J (treating Consultant) Key points:<br /><br />  <br /><br /> His hospital is a large busy hospital and is the Regional Cardio-thoracic Centre for some 650,000 people. It serves a large geographical area in respect of serious heart disease and is the only one in the area to do so. In 1991 there were only 11 beds for acute cardiology patients in the CCU. There were a further 34 beds for chronic  cardiology patients. There was always pressure on these beds. The system which operated in 1991 was not to have all these acute beds occupied all the time because space had to be kept for the admission of new acute patients. Nor was it possible to admit all patients with chest pain. The frequency of chest pain was too great to allow that. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Symptoms  had to be stratified in such a way to decide which patients should be admitted to the CCU and which not. That is because the decision to admit initially was the general practitioner's and the hospital had no choice in the matter at that stage. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Dr J accepted that occasionally wrong decisions were made in deciding which patients to keep in hospital but the published results showed that 95% of them were correct. With regard to the deceased he remembered the situation clearly. That was because he was shocked when she died and he had looked back over what had taken place. He had seen the deceased once. While he was heavily committed during the day with other duties he was always available if necessary but there had been no request for his attendance before his ward round. He also saw and considered the ECG traces taken on admission and at midday. He recognised that there was a change in the latter. These, however, were slight in his view and could be due to many causes, only one of which was cardiac disease. They were not compatible with acute myocardial infarction. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> It was true that they increased the likelihood of a cardiac event taking place but that was heavily outweighed by the fact that a woman of the deceased's age was so unlikely to have coronary disease. All this took place before Dr J examined the deceased. He then saw the patient.  He took a history from her and examined her. At that time she was no more concerned than most people in her situation and she seemed well. She conversed with him in an articulate way. Her vital signs - pulse and blood pressure - were normal. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Dr J said that if he had thought there was a likelihood of the deceased having cardiac disease, he would not have discharged her at that time. He was at complete variance with the view expressed that the deceased should not have been discharged until a cardiac origin for her chest pain had been excluded, if by that was meant exclusion by serial ECGs and enzyme tests. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> He said one had to take account of available capacity in the hospital. It was different from other big cities where there was more than one hospital in the area with a coronary care unit. In his hospital if the patient was very unlikely to have a cardiac problem, the case could not be managed on the basis that that unlikely event might materialise. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> There must be regard to available resources. Socio-economic factors had also to be taken into account, particularly when in most cases it would be wholly unnecessary to keep the patient in hospital. In any event, in his own mind and using his clinical judgment he thought he had excluded a cardiac origin for the pain. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> It was impractical to admit or keep in hospital all patients with chest pain who have a low probability of coronary artery disease as a cause of their symptoms. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> He said that expert witnesses now had the benefit of hindsight which of course he did not have. He also made the point that experts did not see the deceased in the Coronary Care Unit and so had not been able to bring his clinical judgment to bear. Dr J thought that was crucial, adding that otherwise one would practice medicine by telephone or e-mail.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> (further evidence to follow)<br /><br />  <br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2015-10-20 08:29:00	0	0
1259	283	1	"Final expert evidence - Professor Foot INDEPENDENT<br /><br />  <br /><br /> He explained that his hospital is large with some 900 beds. It receives patients both from its local area and also from elsewhere in the country and on occasions from abroad.  He doubted that there was a ""normal"" practice in 1991 as to whether patients with chest pain should be admitted and kept in hospital. It was impractical to admit and keep in hospital all such patients. For example, at his hospital about 6,000 patients per annum present with suspected cardiac pain. It would be impossible to retain them all in hospital. It was necessary, therefore, to decide who was likely in fact to have cardiac pain. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> In 1991 there were three publications which reported that half of all hospital presentations with chest pain were not admitted. Given the deceased's age and gender she was at low risk of cardiac problems. A strong family history of ischaemic heart disease and smoking were risk factors but were not very specific. About 40% would give a similar family history and in 1991 a third of women of that age were smokers. But a large number of people with a similar history would not go on to have a heart attack. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Professor Foot thought that it was extremely unlikely that the deceased had had a heart attack on the morning of 12 June. It was very unusual for a person to have a heart attack and at the same time to have remitting pain and a normal ECG. Moreover, there was no history of sweating, no pallor, the pulse was not substantially elevated and blood pressure was normal. There was also no history of pain on exertion. That was unusual in a person who had underlying heart disease. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> We now know that the deceased did in fact have extensive heart disease and in retrospect he thought that what the deceased had that morning was unstable angina, although the symptoms were the same as for pain of a non-cardiac origin. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Not only was he of the view that the deceased's symptoms indicated that it was unlikely that she had had a heart attack on the morning of 12 June, but the fact that the ECG was normal on admission and the chest pain was resolving argued strongly against an evolving heart attack. They did not exclude it but made it highly unlikely. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Only 2-3% of those who had an evolving heart attack would have an entirely normal initial ECG. He agreed that it would not have been unreasonable to consider discharging the deceased at that stage. He added that in North America, where there are greater resources, more patients would be retained but a significant proportion would still be sent home. With regard to Dr Woods view that the patient should be kept in hospital until a cardiac origin for the chest pain had been scientifically excluded, that is, for about 24 hours, he said that that was a statement of the ideal but was not consistent with United Kingdom practice.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Although there were changes in the T-waves in three of the leads, they were not diagnostic of a cardiac condition. They could be due to that but could be due other causes. They were non-specific. They are part of the evidence which consisted of all investigations performed and the clinical assessment. The latter was the most important element. He did not agree with Dr Moon's view that it would have been normal practice in light of the changes in the ECG to have monitored the deceased in the Coronary Care Unit as well as repeating the ECGs and the enzyme tests. That, he thought, was a statement of the ideal but in 1991 it was common for people showing inversion of the T-waves to be discharged from hospital after having presented with chest pain. He was therefore of the view that Dr J was not negligent in discharging the deceased when he did.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Judgement of the Court to follow.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> kirked"	kirked	2015-10-26 10:27:00	0	0

1262	283	1	Kirked<br /><br /> I’m interested to see more discussion of this case because of generic lessons and because it exemplifies specific problems of managing patients with perhaps the trickiest type of acute coronary syndrome.   No tissue infarction has yet occurred because the coronary artery has not yet completely occluded but may well do so soon if not treated quickly.<br /><br /> Whilst many aspects of management of ST elevation infarction have improved hugely in the 24 years since your case, many problems remain for similar patients to the one discussed. I would say first that none of my comments represent ‘throwing stones’ as one correspondent remarked about an earlier case.  Rather that, the greatest importance of these cases is not whether or not the court decides about something called negligence but why things go wrong and what might prevent similar mistakes by others.  There seem to be three processes that lead to error.<br /><br /><br />   Clinical reasoning: The first challenge with acute chest pain is to decide, clinically, whether the pain is caused by myocardial ischaemia or whether there are positive features to suggest other causes.  Here there were clearly symptoms that suggested a high probability for myocardial ischaemia and they convinced the clinicians to take the right initial steps in management.  Having decided, reasonably, that myocardial infarction had not occurred, the reasoning process then seemed to go awry.  The thinking then changed to there being a low probability of ischaemic heart disease and yet nothing had changed this probability, only that it hadn’t yet caused infarction.  Suddenly deciding that the pain was due to ‘oesophageal spasm’ has no justification other than the need to put something on the discharge note.<br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /><br />External factors:  The intense pressures to free beds can cause clinicians to reason in different ways and to assess risk differently, even though they usually don’t know whether the next patient competing for the bed will have greater or lesser need.  Here there were known  to be inadequate numbers of beds and clinicians should not to be bullied into accepting policies that could be dangerous.  Clinicians may not be able to force better decisions but not, at least, to register concerns can mean that those who should later accept responsibility for harm can claim “clinicians agreed with the policy”.<br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /><br />Guidelines:  While good guidelines can have great value they are too often ineffective or worse because of their poor presentation and the ways in which they are misunderstood or misused.  I’m not sure what guidelines for NSTEMI patients were in use at that hospital at that time.  The challenge is to decide which patients should undergo urgent cardiac catheterisation and which could go home without that investigation.  Adam Timmis has just recently written a helpful BMJ article on managing patients with acute coronary syndrome.  The decision about urgent catheterisation in NSTEMI patients now depends on the ‘GRACE’ score which purports to tell the risk of death within the next six months.  We don’t have precise data to calculate the risk for this patient but it’s likely she would have shown below the 3% threshold for intervention (yet she died).  Some of the rapid responses mention some specific problems with this calculator.  My additional concern is that clinical experience/intuition/judgement (‘mindlines’) shouldn’t be thrown aside if guidelines don’t seem right for a particular context.

1263	283	1	Should she have been returned earlier to A&E given that no diagnosis had been established?<br /><br /> If she had not been discharged the recurrence of the same pain should have prompted closer discussions with the cardiologist .

1264	283	1	Difficult case.. with hindsight it makes it easy to analyse but i can totally emphatise with admitting doctor being under pressure to free up beds. <br /><br /> Its the most annoying thing (although somewhat necessary) to free up beds as soon someone is admitted. <br /><br /> Although i still think the threshold to admit younger patients should be lower than elderly because younger patients dont often present with classical symptoms especially when they are women.

1265	284	1	I have a long-standing objection to racial prejudice. I see that UK university applications are to remove names from some initial applications. This takes me back about 30 years when those wishing to have a facade of political correctness arranged to have race , age and gender taken off application forms from those applying for junior doctor posts . My suggestion that one would need to remove names as well was met with gentle ridicule. Sitting on appointments committees one was well aware of major prejudices and I recall 1 really excellent doctor wih a foreign sounding married name whose applications met with an almost zero response until she reverted to using her very English maiden name. That solved the problem overnight. Other high flyers chose to emigrate knowing that top UK jobs were unlikely to be available on an unequal playing field.<br /><br /> I wonder just how far we have improved - the approach being adopted by the universities suggests prejudice is rife. A harder question is to know just why this prejudice continues. There can be many reasons some of which are partially rational but others can only be put down to simple prejudice. <br /><br /> And can bias be a problem in another direction ? I recall a comment made that I was not Jewish , Catholic or a Mason but still got some good jobs - so was either good at my subject or acceptable to all parties as a compromise......	sken	2015-10-27 19:34:00	0	0

1275	286	1	Ideally one would see a Doctor or nurse  or other health care worker who was competent in their role and relatively humane in  their manner.<br /><br /> I note the minister was not complaining about having effective care.The doctor would  obviously been better able to tell him to P... off and stop wasting his (or her ) time, maybe run back to Parliament and start saying something useful for a change perhaps?<br /><br /> If we start needing to wear uniforms ie extra stripes for doctors, gold braid for consultants or anybody else  who felt particularly insecure generally    we will then start insisting patients have badges then stars to identify themselves. ( Somatisers   get extra badges for extra effort perhaps?) Ideally we should just all  be clean-certainly nurses and ideally most doctors too.	rcdeacon	2015-10-10 19:41:00	0	0
1276	287	1	Congratulations to Governor Jerry Brown in California in signing the Bill to make California the fifth state in the USA to allow assisted dying. This is not so much because he signed the Bill , but because as a lifelong Roman Catholic and a former Jesuit seminarian he could put these to one side whilst he acted as Governor in the face of the pressures to pass this Bill. How totally different from some of our UK politicians. Some MPs clearly had objections on other grounds but those where the objection seemed equally clearly based on religion should declare an interest or at least make their religion overt as with the bishops in the HoL.<br /><br />   The California Bill includes requirements include the need for several written requests from the patient and witnesses etc… and the patients must be physically capable of taking the medication themselves.<br /><br />  I continue to support some form of assisted dying in the UK . Despite recently topping the international league for palliative care we clearly have many folk who find what may lie ahead somewhat scary.  Even if almost no-one availed themselves of a law change , I think there is a very strong case for the re-assurance that the option of AD seems to give.  I continue to be more concerned that the thrust of many of those objecting to AD goes way beyond stopping AD law change and wish to limit withdrawal of therapy , allowing patients to refuse treatments and feeding.<br /><br />  Finally , back to the USA   and Rob Schenck of the Faith and Action group.

1278	287	1	Duane- many thanks but i think many of us feel there is a difference between using an assisted death for the terminally ill as part of palliative care and laws that may allow gun crime and shooting schoolchildren. Gawande's book emphasised - along with others and surveys - how far the USA lags behind in care of the dying. It is this together with some of the real poverty and ensuing poor access to optimal healthcare that exists in California that made even me , a lifelong supporter of assisted dying , have grave misgivings about this new law. Equally , there is a dilemma for those with deep seated religious beliefs , but in a position of authority (whether medical or political) . I thought it positive that the Governor did not just use his religion to opt out.<br /><br /> I have also had almost lifelong respect for Mahatma Gandhi who was very much against killing , yet even he could see that there was a place for shortening life if there was no other way of ending the suffering of a dying person and this shortening was part of medical treatment.	sken	2015-10-09 11:29:00	0	0
1279	287	1	Sken,<br /><br /> I assure you,  I agree with your assertion that there is a place for assisted Death,  I see the need in the worst cases, and I understand the premise.  I agree with your views on Ghandi too, and I study his writings with great respect.   Now as to the Laws that allow killing of school children, Here is the truth,   what allows killing of innocent school children is not lax gun laws, but rather the same lax laws politicians posiut instead of tougher laws.  IE - GUN FREE ZONES, of course criminals who are cowards always attack schools because there is no guns there, and they go for the easy kill!   In america we guard our Money - Brinks trucks with armed guards and we guard everything except our kids,  kind of stupid huh?   As a Cop,  I have seen murderers do 5 years then get set free,  this is where we need tougher laws and judges with some sense of toughness and reality.  Stop releasing killers from jail!  That is the solution, not more stupid laws no one will enforce....<br /><br />  <br /><br /> DuaneF	DuaneF	2015-10-09 13:12:00	0	0

1282	287	1	Duane - surely USA schools have gun free zones ? In the UK some areas were having a problem with knives and I think metal detectors were installed at the gates. There seems to be something very personal about these school killings in the sense that the killing is close contact - not just picking targets off with a high powered rifle - and the death of the perpetrator part of the overall tragedy. What irritates from the UK point of view is the argument that the problem could be solved by arming the teachers +/- older children. Personally , I am not anti-guns per se and also feel that it is near impossible to control some of these killings by just legislating against guns . 300 million and rising is a big population and there will always be a few folk on the fringes - that's all it takes. We have been having quite a few problems with priests (RC and CoE) but castration on ordination is not the answer - although some of our more extreme atheists might go along with just that......	sken	2015-10-09 16:21:00	0	0

1284	288	1	"Following trials in several parts of the country (UK) Polygraphs (Lie Detectors) will now be used to monitor offenders who have abused children. The belief is that their use is beneficial in assessing whether the offender has re-offended or is likely to. Whilst I am all for proper monitoring of such individuals I am concerned because there is no solid scientific evidence that Polygraphs work at all.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Polygraphs measure arousal, which can be caused by anxiety, anxiety disorders such as PTSD, nervousness, fear, confusion, hypoglycaemia, psychosis, depression, substance induced (nicotine, stimulants), substance withdrawal state (alcohol withdrawal) or other emotions; polygraphs do not measure ""lies."" A polygraph cannot differentiate anxiety caused by dishonesty and anxiety caused by something else.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Because there is no pattern of arousal that is unique to deception, the decision to classify a set of responses as untruthful is inevitably a leap from the shaky ground of ambiguous data into the fog of inference. As a result, techniques to ""beat"" a polygraph are simple and effective. The simplest strategy seems to be to increase arousal during the control questions, rather than trying to reduce arousal during deception, to eliminate any difference.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Polygraphy is widely criticized. Despite claims of 90% validity by polygraph advocates, the National Research Council has found no evidence of effectiveness. The utility among sex offenders is also poor with insufficient evidence to support accuracy or improved outcomes in this population.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Even using the high estimates of the polygraph's accuracy, false positives occur, and these people suffer the consequences of ""failing"" the polygraph. In the 1998 Supreme Court case, United States v. Scheffer, the majority stated that ""There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable"" and ""Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the jurors' knowledge, such as the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, or DNA found at a crime scene, a polygraph expert can supply the jury only with another opinion..."".<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The accuracy of the polygraph has been contested almost since the introduction of the device. In 2003, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report entitled ""The Polygraph and Lie Detection"". The NAS found that the majority of polygraph research was ""unreliable, unscientific and biased"", concluding that 57 of the approximately 80 research studies that the American Polygraph Association relies on to come to their conclusions were significantly flawed. These studies did show that specific-incident polygraph testing, in a person untrained in counter-measures, could discern the truth at ""a level greater than chance, yet short of perfection"". However, due to several flaws, the levels of accuracy shown in these studies ""are almost certainly higher than actual polygraph accuracy of specific-incident testing in the field"". <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Polygraphy Tests are very common in the US with police departments but are not admissible in court in many States (with some specific exceptions). <br /><br />  <br /><br /> I am interested in what medics here think about this. Do you think measuring fleeting changes in BP, Pulse, Respirations and sweating are reliable physiological proxies reflecting dishonesty?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> If you were accused of a crime would you be willing to take a Polygraph test?<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Ps. It is also interesting that many Soviet Spies have passed the polygraph repeatedly - Aldrich Ames comes to mind.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> PPS. The Green River Killer, Gary Leon Ridgeway, pled guilty to murdering 48 women in the Seattle area over a twenty-year period. Ridgeway was given a polygraph following the murder of his fourth victim and passed the polygraph exam.  He was then dropped as a suspect and went on to kill another 44 women.  He is listed as the most prolific killer in U.S. history."	kirked	2015-10-03 13:58:00	0	0
1285	288	1	Kirked,<br /><br /> As a side note,  Although polygraphs are widely used, and seemingly trusted in the USA,  they are relatively easy to fool!   Many, Many Techniques exist to overcome the polygraph, and the reliability seems flawed from the outset, since the data is interpreted by an examiner, who in most cases is a Police officer, trained in the use of a machine, which is not anywhere near 100% accurate!<br /><br /> DuaneF	DuaneF	2015-10-03 14:57:00	0	0
1286	288	1	As you say, kirked, the polygraph 'measures' arousal, by lying or possibly by being shown images likely to arouse a paedophile?   Would perverted sexual arousal be more difficult to mask than lying arousal?   These people are unable to suppress thier 'unusual' sexual preferences - perhaps they will be unable to use the many techniques that fool the Polygraph either.<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-10-04 12:42:00	0	0
1287	288	1	"Actually John,<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Here is what a polygraph measures, : -  <br /><br /><br />  The Polygraph Machine<br /><br /><br /><br />  The polygraph instrument has undergone a dramatic change in the last decade. For many years, polygraphs were those instruments that you see in the movies with little needles scribbling lines on a single strip of scrolling paper. These are called analog polygraphs. Today, most polygraph tests are administered with digital equipment. The scrolling paper has been replaced with sophisticated algorithms and computer monitors. ­<br /><br />   <br /><br />­<br />The basic components of a lie detector system<br /><br />  ­When you sit down in the chair for a polygraph exam, several tubes and wires are connected to your body in specific locations to monitor your physiological activities. Deceptive behavior is supposed to trigger certain physiological changes that can be detected by a polygraph and a trained examiner, who is sometimes called a forensic psychophysiologist (FP). This examiner is looking for the amount of fluctuation in certain physiological activities. Here's a list of physiological activities that are monitored by the polygraph and how they are monitored:<br /><br /><br />Respiratory rate - Two pneumographs, rubber tubes filled with air, are placed around the test subject's chest and abdomen. When the chest or abdominal muscles expand, the air inside the tubes is displaced. In an analog polygraph, the displaced air acts on a bellows, an accordion-like device that contracts when the tubes expand. This bellows is attached to a mechanical arm, which is connected to an ink-filled pen that makes marks on the scrolling paper when the subject takes a breath. A digital polygraph also uses the pneumographs, but employs transducers to convert the energy of the displaced air into electronic signals.<br />   <br />     <br /><br /><br />Blood pressure/heart rate - A blood-pressure cuff is placed around the subject's upper arm. Tubing runs from the cuff to the polygraph. As blood pumps through the arm it makes sound; the changes in pressure caused by the sound displace the air in the tubes, which are connected to a bellows, which moves the pen. Again, in digital polygraphs, these signals are converted into electrical signals by transducers.<br />   <br />     <br /><br /><br />Galvanic skin resistance (GSR) - This is also called electro-dermal activity, and is basically a measure of the sweat on your fingertips. The finger tips are one of the most porous areas on the body and so are a good place to look for sweat. The idea is that we sweat more when we are placed under stress. Fingerplates, called galvanometers, are attached to two of the subject's fingers. These plates measure the skin's ability to conduct electricity. When the skin is hydrated (as with sweat), it conducts electricity much more easily than when it is dry.<br /><br /><br />­<br /><br />  ­Some polygraphs also record arm and leg movements. As the examiner asks questions, signals from the sensors connected to your body are recorded on a single strip of moving paper. You will learn more about the examiner and the test itself later.<br /><br />  Detractors of the polygraph call lie detection a voodoo science, saying that polygraphs are no more accurate at detecting lies than the flip of a coin. ""Despite claims of 'lie detector' examiners, there is no machine that can detect lies,"" reads a statement from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). ""The 'lie detector' does not measure truth-telling; it measures changes in blood pressure, breath rate and perspiration rate, but those physiological changes can be triggered by a wide range of emotions.""­<br /><br />  Lee, who has been performing ­polygraph exams for 18 years, agrees that polygraphs do not detect lies. ""What has happened over the years is that the media has dubbed this lie detection, and that's what's clicked, but from a scientific perspective, absolutely not. There's no such thing as lie detection. I couldn't tell you what a lie looks like.""<br /><br />  He does assert that polygraphs can detect deceptive behavior even through the stress brought on by the exam itself. ""If the (forensic psychophysiologist) is properly trained and has the experience, he can penetrate that. Through the specific procedure that the FP will employ, anxiety will not penetrate into it."" <br /><br /><br /> You might be referring to a  <br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/penile-plethysmography-controversy-sex-offenders-article-1.2181079<br /><br /> In any event,<br /><br /> While in Law Enforcement I took training to become a Polygraph  examiner, and upon Graduation I refused to ever give an exam, Based upon my Moral, and Scientific belief that the science holds as much promise as Homeopathy, IE - ZERO!!<br /><br /> Simply stated the machine does not tell if your lying, rather that your nervous, which might, and could be be for any number of reasons!<br /><br /> DuaneF"	DuaneF	2015-10-04 14:43:00	0	0
1288	288	1	Duane,<br /><br /> I'm not so naive as to think that the standard polygraph 'measures' sexual arousal directly, by penile enlargement or some such.    Instead, it could use the standard parameters that it does measure, which are those of 'arousal', stress, which may have many causes.  In fact, I'm sure I read somewhere that one technique to flummox the machine and its operators is to indulge in erotic daydreams during the preliminary 'control' questions.<br /><br /> My point, which perhaps I didn't make clear, was that there may be a place for this in monitoring the progress of desensitising (?correct word?) or re-educating sex offenders.  To use eit to screen for, or to implicate suspects would be, as you have pointed out, so scientifically suspect as to be invalid. <br /><br /> This idea may have 'legs' - this article used a polygraph as one limb of a biofeedback system to re-educate  patients with an overactive bladder: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Polygraph+re-education<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-10-04 16:36:00	0	0

1292	289	1	Miss Z, aged 52 was a part time GP. She consulted her own GP regarding hot facial flushes, night sweats. palpitations, irritability and mood swings. She suspected it was the Menopause and her GP agreed. The GP did not carry out any physical examination or check any vital parameters.  She was started on HRT and did not need to consult the GP again for about 8 months - she automatically requested refills of prescriptions as needed. When she did return to her GP she explained that the symptoms were better since being on HRT but not eradicated. She also stated that over the last few weeks she had periodical intense headaches and anxiety which seemed to coincide with the hot flushes.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The GP changed the medication regime slightly and advised her to return if symptoms did not settle and they might consider other options. A week after seeing her Miss Z was taken unwell whilst at work. She explained to the Paramedics what treatment she was on (HRT only) and that she had noted her BP was high on several occasions (using her own sphygmomanometer) when she was flushed. Her BP on assessment in A&E by an SpR noted a BP of 190/115 but other parameters were all normal.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Twenty four hours after admission to hospital her BP was fluctuating between 190/115 and 210/110 but all other Parameters were considered within normal ranges. On day 3 of admission she suffered a severe haemorrhagic stroke which required intensive nursing and physiotherapy to achieve even a minimal level of independence.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> It subsequently transpired she had Phaeochromocytoma which would have explained several of her symptoms. Miss Z felt very let down by her GP and hospital Doctor whom she felt should have considered Phaeo  and might, therefore have prevented the stroke.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> She sued her GP and the hospital.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked	kirked	2015-09-27 04:34:00	1	0

This scenario was related to me a few days ago by a colleague from the country concerned - he was a lawyer in the case.<br /><br />My colleague did say however, that the GP patient was distressed because she didn't speak up more about what the hospital Doctors might have in their minds' as possible problems she had and what options were open to them investigate.<br /><br />i would have been curious to know if being a Doctor and patient made matters better or worse for her?

1297	289	1	I think menopause was a reasonable first differential (and who knows, she may have been menopasual as well as having a phaeo) - but not doing a BP check before starting HRT strikes me as indefensible.	Pat Harkin	2015-09-29 14:33:00	1	0
1298	289	1	Kirked<br /><br /> Like  John D and Pat Harkin  I think it's indefensible not to measure blood pressure before prescribing hormone replacement therapy (in any country) and odd that nothing much sounds to have been done diagnostically even after admission. Doctors as patients can affect care in different ways.  It doesn’t sound as if the right diagnosis occurred to the patient and her suggestion of ‘the menopause’ as a diagnosis might have been accepted too easily.<br /><br /> Looking more closely at what lessons this case might offer, I will admit a slight interest in phaeochromocytomas.  In training I spent several years on a unit where blood pressure was a major interest.  As a consultant physician (not with particular BP interest) I diagnosed four patients with phaeos in time to allow successful surgery and saw one other patient, a very young man, who presented in extremis with acute heart failure secondary to extensive subendocardial infarction and who died before the diagnostic biochemical tests returned.  This is an unusual number of patients for one consultant to see in a working lifetime but I don’t know how much was chance and how much increased awareness.<br /><br /> When a rare diagnosis is missed and legal proceedings occur I guess the Bolam principle is a consideration.  Unfortunately we often don’t know what a body of our peers would do (as opposed to what they might say in retrospect) in any given circumstances.  Most expert witnesses probably don’t constitute typical peers.  The general argument sometimes put forward in defence is that most doctors might never ‘see’ more than one phaeo (or other rare condition) in a working lifetime. How many are missed is another question and I think most phaeos are still diagnosed post-mortem.<br /><br /> The point about rarity and recognition is understandable but problematic.  It might suggest that we could never be expected to diagnose conditions we have never seen but that would be ridiculous.  There are many rare diseases or those occurring in very unusual contexts that defy the best clinicians but rare things do occur and missing some can be fatal.  Any diagnosis is easy once you’ve thought of it.  The challenge in clinical reasoning (a subject still formally taught in only a very few medical schools) is to give yourself the best chance to ‘think of it’.    <br /><br /> The process of diagnosis involves comparing the illness script with the usual scripts of the most important candidate conditions (not just the first one to come to mind).  Distinctive clusters of symptoms can act as mental prompts.  The combination of headaches, sweating and palpitations in attacks is highly suggestive of phaeo even if the blood pressure is unremarkable outside attacks.   Many patients also report ‘funny turns’ or odd feelings that can defy explanation.  Flushing is actually not that common.  Perhaps the most important single technique to avoid missing things is, when you think you have the diagnosis, to ask “could this be anything else?”<br /><br /> As you’ve shown us, the legal discussions in these cases are often very searching and it’s a shame when valuable lessons learned don’t link back into mandatory learning for others (as we’ve discussed with civil aviation).  The defence society journals do this quite well but I suspect the lessons are read only by a minority of doctors.

1300	289	1	However sad it may be, I just could not fathom that the patient at the age of 52, being a doctor herself never checked her own BP, having BP monitors available on the desk, not even out of curiosity.	saravanamuthu	2015-10-03 07:49:00	0	0
1301	289	1	In the UK also there is a real risk of many rarer diagnoses being missed in general practice and hospitals. Some diagnoses require time for a decent history and time for the clinician to think and reflect. Clinicians don't have this time and so diagnoses frequently seem to get dumbed down to the 'most likey' without any consideration of a differential. Increasing use of NPs and HCAs may (or may not) exacerbate this - without a medical degree how can rare things be considered?<br /><br /> There are well documented examples of persistent late diagnoses for unusual conditions such as MS and SLE for these reasons.<br /><br /> In this case obviously the BP should have been measured and this makes it indefensible. But it's possible it may have been normal/high normal at the time of measurement. The clues were in the history but it would have taken time and an interest to elicit them.	rayhope	2015-10-03 08:15:00	0	0

1315	293	1	Thanks for this new thread John.  I put comments about weight loss on the e-cigarette thread because both losing weight and stopping smoking (I admit I've never been a smoker) primarily involve determination and the need to avoid fooling oneself.  Other addictions such as to opiates or alcohol are very different because unplanned or unsupervised cessation can be life threatening.  This is not the case with sensible restriction of food or for smoking cessation.   To answer Sken's question 'was it worth it for me?' the answer is unquestionably yes.  To be honest I was only looking to use a few pounds but the principles and strategy are probably the same for any amount.  My own approach is based on (a) my past work in gastroenterology with an interest in metabolic problems (b) personal experience of what works.<br /><br /> 1) Be brutally honest.  Whatever the 'flat-earthers' claim, the key is net energy balance.  Do not fool yourself wittingly or unwittingly about how much you eat.<br /><br /> 2)  Set a target and be sensible about the time course.  One pound loss a week is enough (sustained, that could lead to three and a half stone loss in one year)<br /><br /> 3)  The debate about sugar vs fat will run and run.  I'm more in the sugar camp but total calories are the important thing eventually.  It's not usually a binary choice.  I agree, John, that biscuits can be a problem.<br /><br /> 4)  The mirror and spouse's comments can be useful modifiers but use measurements rather than guesswork..  Weight and abdominal circumference are applicable at home.<br /><br /> 5)  I  enjoy exercise and know it helps me in many ways but there are 9 kiloCals metabolic energy in a pound of fat and that is a long time on the cross-trainer!  Diabetes MD has just given a very helpful update on the role of exercise and I would add just a couple of points.  The effects of exercise on metabolic rate can persist after the session and it can be important to add resistance exercise to replace fat with lean tissue to help this.<br /><br /> 6) Don't give up!  The whole science of weight loss has been summed up in two words: 'eat less'.  If that's not working, add a third word, 'eat less still'.  You don't have to stop all the enjoyable things and smaller amounts of better wine or older malt whisky are better than what we used to guzzle when younger!<br /><br /> Incidentally Sken, the gold price is still far too low to contemplate moving to Kuwait.

1319	293	1	Sounds as though it is a bit late for you lot , but seems to be lots of good advice out there. The invaluable advice given out by Prof Garrow who had a particular interest in obesity was simply weigh yourself and if it is going up then eat less or exercise more. It is just so much easier to avoid putting the weight on than it is to lose it. Of course if folk manage to lose weight , this approach is still relevant. But sometimes I see just stabilising weight is as much as can be achieved realistically. I think John Garrow's own method was to weigh himself at Christmas and take it off by Easter after making good use of Lent.<br /><br /> All this is just reiterating the post by Maxim. The great advantage of the net balance approach is that one does not have to fuss too much about special diets although it helps to cut out high sugar foodstuffs. And one has to learn to look on the packet and use a bit of common sense. Until I retired I did not bother much with regular meals. <br /><br /> On the occasions I venture out to restaurants  2 things amaze me 1. The meals provided are almost always high calorie and the size seems way OTT  ;   2. Most of the other customers are already fairly fat and seem to manage to eat everything put in front of them. <br /><br /> Recently I realised my BMI will be on the rise : I have just been measured (not for a coffin) and find I am 3 inches shorter than in my youth , so perhaps I too will have to watch my intake more carefully....<br /><br /> What I would really like to know is whether any of you have found a reliable way of keeping the weights of your offspring under control : that is the really big question facing the UK and I know just how hard some parents find tackling it.	sken	2015-08-21 20:04:00	0	0

1338	298	1	In the first study to examine the acceptability of incentives for health care providers for improving smoking cessation and breastfeeding rates, Hoddinott et al surveyed early years professionals via email to ascertain their agreement or disapproval of the practice.<br /><br />In the UK, rates of smoking in pregnancy and breastfeeding have shown only modest improvements in recent years: in 2010, 12% of women in the UK reported that they were still smoking at the time of birth. Targets across the country have aimed to improve the rates of uptake of breastfeeding and smoking cessation, but have not yet been successful in their goals. It has been suggested that financial incentives for health care providers may provide a solution to this problem, motivating providers to engage patients further.<br /><br />In exploring the acceptability, mechanisms and consequences of provider incentives amongst health professionals, this study found that the subject of incentives provokes mixed views among staff. Provider incentives were generally favoured by non-medical staff, with doctors being more cautious. While incentives may encourage investment in support services which would be of value to pregnant women, the authors conclude that further experimental research is required prior to any policy interventions, given the mixed acceptability between health professionals.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on provider incentives for meeting targets? Do you think that they could help providers achieve targets for breastfeeding and smoking cessation, or will they put services and care at risk?<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /> More information about this article:<br /><br />Abstract<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Objective To explore the acceptability, mechanisms and consequences of provider incentives for smoking cessation and breast feeding as part of the Benefits of Incentives for Breastfeeding and Smoking cessation in pregnancy (BIBS) study.<br /><br /><br /><br />Design Cross-sectional survey and qualitative interviews.<br /><br /><br /><br />Setting Scotland and North West England.<br /><br /><br /><br />Participants Early years professionals: 497 survey respondents included 156 doctors; 197 health visitors/maternity staff; 144 other health staff. Qualitative interviews or focus groups were conducted with 68 pregnant/postnatal women/family members; 32 service providers; 22 experts/decision-makers; 63 conference attendees.<br /><br /><br /><br />Methods Early years professionals were surveyed via email about the acceptability of payments to local health services for reaching smoking cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding targets. Agreement was measured on a 5-point scale using multivariable ordered logit models. A framework approach was used to analyse free-text survey responses and qualitative data.<br /><br /><br /><br />Results Health professional net agreement for provider incentives for smoking cessation targets was 52.9% (263/497); net disagreement was 28.6% (142/497). Health visitors/maternity staff were more likely than doctors to agree: OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.51 to 3.64; p<0.001). Net agreement for provider incentives for breastfeeding targets was 44.1% (219/497) and net disagreement was 38.6% (192/497). Agreement was more likely for women (compared with men): OR 1.81 (1.09 to 3.00; p=0.023) and health visitors/maternity staff (compared with doctors): OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.65 to 3.91; p<0.001). Key emergent themes were ‘moral tensions around acceptability’, ‘need for incentives’, ‘goals’, ‘collective or divisive action’ and ‘monitoring and proof’. While provider incentives can focus action and resources, tensions around the impact on relationships raised concerns. Pressure, burden of proof, gaming, box-ticking bureaucracies and health inequalities were counterbalances to potential benefits.<br /><br /><br /><br />Conclusions Provider incentives are favoured by non-medical staff. Solutions which increase trust and collaboration towards shared goals, without negatively impacting on relationships or increasing bureaucracy are required.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> Link to the full text version of the paper: http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/11/e008492.full	Emma Gray	2015-11-16 16:13:00	0	0

The Assembly report is more detailed and shows pockets where the incidance is more than 150/100K.    The WHO classifies countries with more than  40/100K as having a ""High Incidence"" and the UK Government publishes a list of such countries to help NHS nurses to decide whether to give a BCG vaccination to children who have arrived in the UK from those countries. <br /><br />Which countries have a higher incidence of TB than some areas of London?  The list is distressingly long, and a disgrace to the World, but to have so much TB in the capital of a major European country is shameful.  It's too long to list here, but take a look at which poor countries London competes with for the title, TB capital:<br /><br /> https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/393840/Worldwide_TB_Surveillance_2013_Data_High_and_Low_Incidence_Tables____2_.pdf<br /><br /> John"	John D	2015-10-28 10:17:00	0	0

London;). In North Queensland there has been a problem of people coming across Torres Strait with TB from PNG and this is often resistant due to their imperfect health service I suppose a bit like London's. <br /><br /> I have seen one woman from the Phillippines who had a lump in her breast due to TB. I treat two women with sarcoidosis breast lumps, one having multiple lumps.<br /><br /> Atypical mycobacterial infections are more common particularly in Queensland where I live and where we also have salt water crocodiles and numerous other challenges to humankind.

1341	299	1	"Thank you, Odysseus!   I think your experience confirms the message from the Assembly's Report, that in most doctors' practices, TB is rare.  But this means that awareness and vigilance are low.   New cases of TB in London accounted for 40% of all cases in the UK, and diagnosis was often delayed due to lack of recognition.<br /><br /> Where is is coming from?   The Report says that 80% with active TB are people who were born abroad.  This can be no surprise, as only 45 % of Londoners in the 2011 census classified themselves as ""white British"",  but it concludes that immigration procedures currently  exclude active, infectious TB, and that latent disease would be impossible to detect and exclude, so increased immigartion control is not part iof the answer.   It emphasises the activation of latent TB by poor housing, poor nutrition and debilitating illness, exactly the conditions that made TB a scourge in 19th and early 20th centuries, and all things that public health measures can address.<br /><br /> I can just about remember mobile TB screening vans, that went about taking chest X-rays for pulmonary TB.  Wolverhampton, where the incidence is only a little less than the 40/100K, set up mobile sscreening earlier this year, though not by X-ray, I think, and London is doing the same.  <br /><br /> Tb rises again, and for the same reasons it did so before.<br /><br /><br /><br /> La Miseria by Cristobal Rojas, 1886<br /><br /> John"	John D	2015-10-29 10:02:00	0	0

1343	299	1	It's true that the majority of cases of active TB are in those born outside the UK but  the incidence in those appears to be falling  according to Public Health England.  The incidence is however increasing in those born in the UK who sleep on the streets (as well as those with alcohol and drug problems or other immune defects).  It's that group that poses the biggest challenges for treatment and follow-up.<br /><br /> I'm not sure it's fair to say that 'the NHS has let this happen'.  It's true that the Public Health service has become weakened in recent years but the real embarrassment is surely that Dickensian conditions still exist alongside incredible wealth in a city with the second highest house prices in the world.  Those on 'skid row' are now not just those who could never cope in any society but include rather a lot of people who were previously doing reasonably well.

1345	301	1	‘The Guardian’ has reported how changes in the way Universities are ranked now give more recognition to the arts and humanities; previously, scientific and biomedical research carried much more weight.  http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/15/british-universities-slip-downing-global-rankings<br /><br /> Not surprisingly, the change has caused controversy as some UK universities have lost ground in world rankings.  Some have questioned how much these rankings really matter except to the business success of Universities.<br /><br /> The controversy might prompt us to look at the way UK medical schools are ranked and in what ways the rankings might or might not have any use.  In a recent ‘Student BMJ’ article Richard Wakeford has taken a critical look at some of the problems of ranking medical schools and how different guides use different criteria and so give different rankings for the same schools.<br /><br />  Student BMJ 2015;23:h1359<br /><br /> Wakeford suggests that prospective students choosing a school might do better to consult a new GMC database that ranks schools by markers of later career progress.  The comparison, for example using pass rates for all major postgraduate exams, gives rather different ranking to the conventional ones.<br /><br /> Prospective medical students choose a medical school for all sorts of reasons.  Social factors can be important for some.  Some prefer to study a more traditional curriculum, others might choose a problem-based or integrated course.  The measurable differences in outcome seem to be small but even with the GMC database we still don’t know how to assess and compare the quality of doctors produced.  Quality of teaching can be highly variable and difficult to gauge in advance; it is usually represented by student questionnaire result but we lack  good measures of face-to face teaching quality.<br /><br /> One factor not included in any rankings is the quality of experience gained in the clinical institutions linked to each medical school.  Recent events in Cambridge have highlighted the difficulties involved in making these judgements but, arguably, it is the clinical experience that might matter most in choosing where to study.<br /><br /> What do doc2doc members think of medical school rankings?<br /><br />   Are they genuinely useful in making informed choices about where to study or are they of more useful in attracting funding for schools?<br /><br />  This topic doesn’t seem to lend itself easily to a traditional doc2doc poll.

University rankings seem to relate predominantly to academic prowess but that may not be the most relevant for the student. The London was my top choice because of its reputation for offering a wealth of clinical experience and and an emphasis on straight clinical teaching and experience. The then UCH was seen as having a much more academic emphasis , St T's for those where ""social awareness"" was important and St M's for those wishing to continue with sporting ambitions etc... All these , and other , stereotypes of course will change over the years but in retrospect (for my rough contemporaries ) the stereotypes of my time seem to have been borne out. <br /><br /> So on grapevine knowledge , I suspect I might have made a similar choice to Odysseus. Of course basic academic standards are also relevant and I did not consider those where I felt this might be somewhat lacking. Perhaps there could be a place for mission statements - something I usually abhor - and the London motto was OK in this respect.<br /><br /> I suspect a bigger factor in choosing a medical school could be how readilly openings are available to jobs in that catchment area.

1355	302	1	Recent figures show increasing numbers of obese or overweight pre-school aged children. Childhood obesity remains a complex public health challenge and is also associated with further adverse health outcomes later in life. Paes et al take a look at the factors influencing obesogenic dietary intake in young children, via a systematic review of qualitative literature, in a paper recently published in BMJ Open. <br /><br />Obesogenic dietary intake is influenced by a number of factors, including parents, family, peer modelling and advertising, as well as a number of barriers, as seen in this investigation. The authors state that these findings support the rationale for designing and testing interventions to reduce obesogenic dietary intake in young children. These future interventions should aim to promote the modelling of positive behaviours and create an environment which promotes a healthy diet to children as they grow.<br /><br />What do you think are the biggest challenges in overcoming overweight and obesity in young children? What types of interventions would you like to see and what would these involve?<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /> More information about this article:<br /><br />Abstract<br /><br /><br />Background Obesogenic dietary intake is prevalent in young children and is associated with obesity and other adverse health outcomes in childhood and later in life.<br /><br /><br /><br />Objective To describe the barriers to and facilitators of obesogenic dietary intake in early childhood, in order to inform interventions and public health policies to prevent obesity.<br /><br /><br /><br />Design Systematic review of qualitative literature on factors influencing obesogenic diets in children aged 0–6 years.<br /><br /><br /><br />Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, British Nursing Index, ASSIA and Sociological Abstracts.<br /><br /><br /><br />Review methods Qualitative studies meeting the inclusion criteria were synthesised. Data were analysed by creating a thematic framework, underpinned by the socioecological model, which included familiarisation of data across the studies, indexing, charting, mapping and interpretation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Results 20 studies from the USA (10), Europe (6) and Australia (4) included the views of 1067 participants (901 parents/caregivers, 37 children, 87 teachers, 15 dieticians and 27 nursery staff). Study designs included focus groups (n=16), individual interviews (n=6) and ethnography (n=1) with some studies using more than one design. Despite wide differences in the study context and focus, several consistent themes emerged. Parental factors increasing young children's obesogenic diets were: negative parent/family/peer modelling, lack of knowledge, time constraints, using food as reward, affordability and concerns about child's health. Child preferences also increased intake. Environmental factors increasing intake include: availability, advertising, societal, cultural and preschool/childcare influences.<br /><br /><br /><br />Conclusions Future intervention strategies should aim to promote modelling of positive behaviours, create home and preschool environments that promote healthy diets, and simultaneously target factors at the family and preschool/childcare levels.<br /><br /><br /><br />Trial registration number This review is one of a series of systematic reviews on the determinants of obesogenic behaviours in young children, registered with the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), CRD42012002881.<br /><br /><br /> Link to the full text version of the paper: http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e007396.full	Emma Gray	2015-09-21 14:27:00	1	0
1356	302	1	Emma<br /><br /> While an impressive amount of work went into this study I wonder what it's really added to what's already known.  The problem of childhood obesity is one of the two or three most serious and urgent health problems in the  UK.  If this were an epidemic of an infectious disease (in one sense it is!) any Government would be in full crisis mode with ministers and pundits dashing off in all directions to contain the problem.<br /><br /> The scale and intensity of this problem has gone beyond anything that can wait for the measured and leisurely approach of 'promoting modelling of postitive behaviours...etc' although those are needed in the longer term.  Some radical things have to be done now and some of those things need urgent government (it should have started with the last two) intervention on a national scale.  This would certainly include limitations on the food and advertising industries.  What I fear happening is that some idiot will alter the definitions of obesity and overweight as a quick fix (don't laugh, it has been mentioned)<br /><br /> Starving one's children is seen as child  abuse and can be dealt with by social services and the criminal justice system.  Whilst the motivation for overfeeding children or allowing their overeating is not usually done maliciously it has equally serious consequences and is happening on a much greater scale.  Money has to flow quickly to allow social services and health visitors to be much more robust in their approach.  The education has to start prenatally and doesn't have to wait for further lengthy studies.  I'm usually an advocate of respecting other peoples' feelings but the fear of giving offence has here allowed the problem to get further out of control. <br /><br /> The approach of recent Governments has been to 'nudge' people into less damaging behaviours.  This approach, based on Chicago behavioural economics and led by the 'behavioural insight unit' is fine for less serious circumstances but is totally inadequate for this one.  If nothing else the multimillion pound industries are shoving so hard in the other direction that nudges back are irrelevant.

1358	303	1	Salloum et al's paper on waterpipe tobacco smoking, recently published in BMJ Open, indicates an increasing prevalence of waterpipe smoking, particularly among university students. With evidence showing that it can be harmful to health, waterpipe tobacco smoking is something that should be studied carefully, to avoid it becoming a major public health issue.<br /><br />This study, the first to elicit preferences from users, showed an increasing demand for waterpipe smoking in young adults - which can be attributed to factors such as pleasant fruit-flavoured tobacco, lower nicotine content labels and lack of understanding of the health warnings associated with waterpipe smoking.<br /><br />In general, participants of the study preferred fruit-flavoured varieties to the standard tobacco flavour. They were also averse to options labelled as having a higher nicotine content, and those exposed to a health warning before smoking were more likely to opt out.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on this emerging public health issue? Should there be waterpipe-specific regulation that prevents the avaliability of flavoured tobacco and therefore it's popularity? Would this work?<br /><br /> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /> More information about this article:<br /><br />Abstract<br /><br /><br />Objectives Waterpipe smoking is highly prevalent among university students, and has been increasing in popularity despite mounting evidence showing it is harmful to health. The aim of this study was to measure preferences for waterpipe smoking and determine which product characteristics are most important to smokers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Setting A large university in the Southeastern USA.<br /><br /><br /><br />Participants Adult waterpipe smokers attending the university (N=367).<br /><br /><br /><br />Design Participants completed an Internet-based discrete choice experiment to reveal their preferences for, and trade-offs between, the attributes of hypothetical waterpipe smoking sessions. Participants were presented with waterpipe lounge menus, each with three fruit-flavoured options and one tobacco flavoured option, in addition to an opt out option. Nicotine content and price were provided for each choice. Participants were randomised to either receive menus with a text-only health-warning message or no message.<br /><br /><br /><br />Outcome measures Multinomial and nested logit models were used to estimate the impact on consumer choice of attributes and between-subject assignment of health warnings respectively.<br /><br /><br /><br />Results On average, participants preferred fruit-flavoured varieties to tobacco flavour. They were averse to options labelled with higher nicotine content. Females and non-smokers of cigarettes were more likely than their counterparts to prefer flavoured and nicotine-free varieties. Participants exposed to a health warning were more likely to opt out.<br /><br /><br /><br />Conclusions Fruit-flavoured tobacco and lower nicotine content labels, two strategies widely used by the industry, increase the demand for waterpipe smoking among young adults. Waterpipe-specific regulation should limit the availability of flavoured waterpipe tobacco and require accurate labelling of constituents. Waterpipe-specific tobacco control regulation, along with research to inform policy, is required to curb this emerging public health threat.<br /><br /><br /> Link to the full text version of the paper: http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e009497.full	Emma Gray	2015-09-14 14:56:00	1	0
1359	304	1	Mass media campaigns can often be a very powerful way of spreading public health messages. Campaigns can reach the public in a number of ways, including television adverts, newspapers and the Internet.<br /><br />However, there can often be concerns about their ethics (having been imposed on a population who have not consented), their expense and their usefulness in spreading healthy messages and initiating healthy behaviours.<br /><br />A systematic review by Allara et al, recently published in BMJ Open, aimed to assess the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in preventing or reducing drug use or the intention to use drugs among young people. They found inconsistency in the evidence available to them in the published literature and as such could draw no general conclusion to answer this question currently - showing that more consideration and research in the future may need to be given to assessing these interventions.<br /><br />What do you think - can mass media campaigns be effective in preventing drug use? Perhaps they are more effective for one population or for other types of intervention?<br /><br /> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /> More information about this article:<br /><br />Abstract<br /><br /><br />Objective To determine whether there is evidence that mass-media campaigns can be effective in reducing illicit drug consumption and the intent to consume.<br /><br /><br /><br />Design Systematic review of randomised and non-randomised studies.<br /><br /><br /><br />Methods We searched four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I and CENTRAL) and further explored seven additional resources to obtain both published and unpublished materials. We appraised the quality of included studies using standardised tools. We carried out meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and a pooled analysis of interrupted time-series and controlled before-and-after studies.<br /><br /><br /><br />Results We identified 19 studies comprising 184 811 participants. Pooled analyses and narrative synthesis provided mixed evidence of effectiveness. Eight interventions evaluated with randomised controlled trials leaned towards no evidence of an effect, both on drug use (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.02; 95% CI −0.15 to 0.12) and the intention to use drugs (SMD −0.07; 95% CI −0.19 to 0.04). Four campaigns provided some evidence of beneficial effects in preventing drug use and two interventions provided evidence of iatrogenic effects.<br /><br /><br /><br />Conclusions Studies were considerably heterogeneous in type of mass-media intervention, outcome measures, underlying theory, comparison groups and design. Such factors can contribute to explaining the observed variability in results. Owing to the risk of adverse effects, caution is needed in disseminating mass-media campaigns tackling drug use.

1360	304	1	Very good that this distinguished group of researcher took care of this question. The results are exactly the way as I expected it as an addiction researcher and contradict the opinion of many prevention specialists worldwide. I hope that drug use prevention resources will be used for more promising drug use prevention models reaching those at risk and helping those who are progressing already in drug use and at risk for drug abuse or dependence in the coming years. The Internet possess a great potential for screening, identify and tailor stepped-care information and interventions to the corresponding general population groups. First examples of Internet and Mobile-phone drug use prevention trials demonstrated effectiveness. However, a lot has still to be done. Let us work together. Prevention, treatment and research specialists should learn from each other and foster better collaboration.	Michael.Schaub	2015-09-04 12:41:00	1	0

1369	305	1	Hi,<br /><br /> Myself Dr Haseena Hamdani is practicing in Gaborone, Botswana. I have done MBBS, and DGO  ( Diploma in Gynecology and Obstetrics) from india.  I  started my career in 1991 in State Government services. At different phases of life, I enjoyed working in a different environment in India, Zambia and Botswana. In India and Zambia i worked as a full time Gynecologist and Obstetrician. The major challenge came in my life when I started my career in Botswana in 2002.. In Botswana, I got license to work as a General medical practioner. I took it as a challenge, and did my best to update myself in general medical, and surgical cases. I did advance course for HIV management also. I started enjoying working as a general practitioner very soon, and feeling more as a complete Doctor. I feel my best clinical expertization is in t Obstetric cases with medical Disorders, paediatric cases, and complicated medical disorders. I put  special emphasis on drug interactions. I am a strong advocate of preventive aspect of hereditary cancers, preventable cancers, and chronic medical disorders. <br /><br /> My expectation from this forum is to interact with other doctors by sharing our good cases and challenging cases. We can learn from each other's mistakes also, so I will not hesitate to share my mistakes which happened in our long journey of career, and expect others also to do the same.<br /><br /> I am also an online Doctor for Health Care Magic.<br /><br /> Dr Haseena Hamdani	HHAMDANI	2013-10-18 14:24:00	0	0

1372	306	1	"I would love to hear your thoughts!!<br /><br /> Statistics show 66% of all patients who visit an urgent care clinic, or ""walk in clinic"" have a primary care physician. The question is - WHY are these people going to a ""walk in clinic"" over visiting their PCP whom they have a relationship with? I believe the answer is simple...convenience and accessibility. People just don't want to wait a week to see their doctor. We expect to do our banking 24/7, shopping 24/7, and now people want their healthcare to be 24/7. I say, let's equip our PCP's with the tools they need to care for their patients remotely to help them fight the battle with retail / urgent clinics and telehealth companies (where no doctor/patient relationship is established). It's time for doctors to get their patients back!!<br /><br />Question - As a doctor, if you had the option to care for your patients in a way as simple as ""SMS texting"" and it was done over a HIPAA compliant platform and you got paid, would you do it? If not, why? <br /><br /> 1.2 billion primary care doctor visits happened last year, roughly 700 million of those could have been done remotely. That's 70%!!"	brittanyfkahn	2016-05-19 16:28:00	0	0

1374	307	1	We are now well into the rhubarb season and those that indulge will be well aware of the potential effect on the gut. A visitor to the UK unused to this could well be classified as having traveller’s diaorrhoea (TD).  Many specialists like to give their special interest an all-inclusive nature. Think psychiatrists and depression or borderline personality disorders.<br /><br />    By defining TD as 3 or more loose motions daily , we include many folk where this is their “normal” – but once they cross the Channel it becomes a disease. The effect I notice with goodly helpings of rhubarb I have when abroad after consuming many of the varied vegetables on offer – often soaked in copious amounts of oil. And that is apart from all those figs in season. BO 3 X daily : if only – and what about the night time as well… And of course any urgency is likely to affect social functioning so I automatically move to a more severe stage of TD by definition.  Co-incidentally , I may have a change in my gut flora , but that would not be  unexpected. <br /><br />   When challenged , those with a particular interest in TD can become incredibly defensive – reminiscent of the psychiatrist who will react with details of patients with severe or psychotic depression to suggestions that minor degrees of being “down-the-dumps” for a short time does not equate with psychiatric disease.<br /><br />  <br /><br />   Perhaps we need to change the definition of TD to one where the disturbance of bowel function is<br /><br /> A. 1. A disturbance beyond the normal bowel habit for the individual ;<br /><br /> 2. Not corrected by a bland diet  ;<br /><br /> 3. Associated with feeling unwell ;<br /><br /> 4. Not responding to 2-6 mgs of loperamide daily ;<br /><br /> or B. . Persisting after return to the UK ,( but needing recognition that any TD may have precipitated the onset of IBS) when a wider differential diagnosis might be relevant.<br /><br />   C. Any significant features such as pyrexia , blood in the stools etc.. are red flag symptoms requiring a different approach and these travellers should not be dismissed as having a tummy upset and lumped together with those with milder symptoms. And as for the outbreaks of Norovirus on cruise ships , I would see that as something else altogether and remain thankful that I do not feel tempted anyway by embarking on one of those floating “townships” (by now not just floating hotels).<br /><br /> The aim of being more restrictive in our definition of TD is in part to discourage the overuse of antibiotics , prophylactic and recognise the true incidence of TD where these might be effective.	sken	2016-05-25 18:21:00	0	0
1375	308	1	Hi, I was wondering if there are any Indian doctors here that would see my friend and write him a prescription to undergo Liquid Biopsy tests for Cancer. This is very urgent as he can not find a doctor that will allow.	VM950	2016-05-23 18:01:00	0	0
1376	308	1	Just what is the urgency - eg general anxiety or for management of a specific cancer and a reason for avoiding biopsy?<br /><br />  I am not sure just how readily these tests are available anyway and one would want to be sure the tester has methods that have been suitably validated. If there really is a good enough reason for going ahead it might be worth approaching one of the units engaged in research. <br /><br /> I would also be very wary of any doctor who just filled in the form for the test without details and ideally seeing the patient first. And making sure that adequate follow-up was in place. As with many cancer tests there is a bit more to it than that  Particularly when dealing with those who may be a bit twitchy for whatever reason.	sken	2016-05-24 18:03:00	0	0

It also offers the added benefit of hands-on diagnosis and treatment through a system of therapy known as osteopathic manipulative medicine.""<br /><br />I found this misleading - is the suggestion that all these benefits are provided by medically / surgically qualified osteopaths , as suggested by the ""and"" in ""and the use technology etc..."" ? Or is - as I think may be the case - that the benefits are provided without resort to conventional assessment etc...? If the latter is suggested then it must come close to contravening advertising rules. Whilst I have met individuals who clearly date their improvement to osteopathic intervention , encouraging people with possible incipient spinal cord compression and other disorders in the differential diagnosis to by-pass conventional care seems to me to be potentially dangerous. But then wasn't it NICE that lumped low back pain and sciatica together recently , so folks might be better off seeing someone who understands there is a difference.....<br /><br />As a matter of interest how often do osteopaths have a medical degree of some sort , as one would expect with homeopathy ?

1386	312	1	A poem by a medical student. Your thoughts please (on the poem or death or otherwise?)<br /><br /> -<br /><br />The Indignity of Death<br /><br /> That moment is fearsome;<br /><br /> When the body trembles under the weight of death.<br /><br /> The eyes fix, the pupils dilate.<br /><br /> These Doctors have seen it before,<br /><br /> More frequently than they can recall.<br /><br /> This is the departure of the soul.<br /><br /> A flight with an unpredictable take-off.<br /><br /> It can start with red herrings;<br /><br /> Something so simple, like no air.<br /><br /> And when you notice the drowning:<br /><br /> The swimming in and out of consciousness,<br /><br /> The training kicks in.<br /><br /> The reflexive actions occur with little thought.<br /><br /> They try to preserve it,<br /><br /> To stop the soul from leaking away.<br /><br /> Sometimes it works, but this time it does not.<br /><br /> She dies on that narrow metal trolley.<br /><br /> Her cut-up dress baring the bruises on her chest –<br /><br /> The remnants of chest compressions.<br /><br /> Her face is slack, turning blue and dulled.<br /><br /> The team step back with a sigh.<br /><br /> Whether it is relief or resignation, it is hard to tell.<br /><br /> Then they watch and wait;<br /><br /> Waiting for the flat line to mark the finality of death.<br /><br /> She is alone,<br /><br /> In a cold, clinical place of healing.<br /><br /> Yet it failed to heal in this instance.<br /><br /> It is pitiful – her loneliness, her nakedness.<br /><br /> The paperwork is filled, the red tape adhered to.<br /><br /> Her husband is then told of her departure.<br /><br /> His wizened face is emotionless –<br /><br /> Perhaps he, too, has become accustomed to death like these Doctors.<br /><br /> But for me, it is beyond tragic.<br /><br /> This lonely, undignified death scares me.<br /><br /> I never want to lose this fear.<br /><br /> I never want death to become an insignificant part of life.<br /><br /> I stand in my corner and pray for her soul,<br /><br /> And pray for mine too,<br /><br /> As they take the shell of my fellow human away.

1387	312	1	As a prospective doctor. you are right to not want to become hardened to death.    You 'stand in a corner' to contemplate this one after the event, perhaps to escape the hubbub of clearing up and readying the emergency room, which cannot be delayed as the next case may be here at once.     You may want to stand aside from the rough black humour that medics use as psychic armour, but you need some protection or your soul will not survive.  Use that release, join in with its use, when you have finished your prayer.<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-05-18 08:01:00	0	0
1388	312	1	"Congratulations to this student - good to see this degree of involvement in the realities of modern medicine. It deserves a wider audience. Reflects some of what David Oliver was saying in his BMJ column recently. There is an underlying theme that the victim (and I see the subjects of CPR as victims all too often) is very elderly - ""the wizened"" face of the husband possibly ""accustomed to death"" suggesting that many of their friends or family have also died. This coupled with the lack of emotional and personal involvement by the resus team who are just doing their job makes this a poem full of insight. The bit about the soul seems OK as well even though one does not believe in such an entity and perhaps it is meant figuratively. Perhaps a prayer for the author's own soul is also in place at having been a witness to this aspect of modern medicine. <br /><br /> I have just finished re-reading Camus' ""A Happy Death"" - some great thoughts in the last few chapters also looking at why some have a terror of dying.<br /><br /> Please convey my appreciation to the author and my best wishes for the future. A high price may have to be paid but I would not want to see the underlying questioning of what we do to disappear in the hurly-burly of modern medical ""care""."	sken	2016-05-18 12:04:00	0	0
1389	312	1	Hi MHMQ<br /><br /> You first posted this poem (which I'm guessing you wrote) in July 2014 when you were a 4th year medical student on an overseas elective in the West Midlands of the UK.  At that time you asked about 'acceptance of death' and there followed some comments that you said were helpful.<br /><br /> Presumably you might now be qualified and perhaps working as a doctor (not sure whether UK or abroad) and the reposting of your poem, with a request for thoughts, seems to suggest that this is still a topic occupying your mind.<br /><br /> Leaving aside the more philosophical aspects of 'accepting' death (from which none of us will ever return to discuss the experience of our own unless misdiagnosed!) it seems reasonable to offer a few thoughts on the 'indignity of death' that is well-observed in your poem.  That might be something which all doctors should be able to minimise by learning to recognise and accept when a patient is getting near to the end of life and when striving to keep them alive is both useless and cruel.  Some doctors are never able or willing to recognise this phase of life and that's often when patients are forced into that undignified and lonely mode of death in an acute hospital instead of at home or in a hospice where the indignities could largely be avoided. We hear a lot of criticism about poor practice around death of patients in acute hospitals and that hospice care could be replicated there.  That seems disingenuous given that hospices wouldn't do so well if they had to deal with general acute clinical problems alongside patients expected to die. <br /><br /> If facilities to allow this better death are lacking wherever you practice then perhaps you could use your poem and observations to campaign for better services.<br /><br /> My other observation would be that too few medical students and junior doctors now have enough experience of all the matters surrounding death.  Time is not spent with patients who are near death and many students haven't even seen a dead body in the dissecting room, clinical area or mortuary before they qualify. <br /><br /> One's own spiritual beliefs are one's own decision but should never be projected onto patients.  A common example that I always found worrying was the practice of avoiding writing in the notes that a patient had 'died' but instead putting a euphemism such as 'RIP'.  You only have to think about the implications of this for a moment to realise how ridiculous and imappropriate it might seem when read in some circumstances by others whether family, coroner or other legal person.	Maxim	2016-05-18 15:22:00	0	0
1390	312	1	In line with the indignity of the death for the presumptively old person in the poem , a recent study of old folk (75-96) recently* showed that only 1/3 wanted to reach 100 and those that wanted this often  had caveats about remaining healthy. An overall 74% response rate of the 2,000+ community dwelling elders  was pretty good -perhaps suggesting some of these people felt quite strongly about this question. It was of course not a UK study (it comes from Finland). The very idea that 2 out of every 3 old people might not wish to live as long as possible would be seen as unacceptable in the UK , with a growing emphasis on asking the family rather than the patient about what should be done. So grit your teeth , get used to resuscitation – and become adept in lying to the family that the patient died peacefully and without distress despite your best efforts …..  But also double-check that it is not your own fear of death that is the root problem.<br /><br /> My current experiences of those who are coming towards the end of life range from the desperate to live whilst dying from cancer to the reasonably well but seeing life as somehow nearing competion in old age - and knowing a degree of self determination since no mortal illness. Our obsession throughout the current NHS is to try to define a one-size -fits all and that is what the next generation has to correct. Particularly when it comes to the end of life.<br /><br /> *Age and Ageing (2016)doi: 10.1093/ageing/afw059	sken	2016-05-18 22:01:00	0	0

1407	316	1	Recently, I met someone who presented himself as 'Dr' but I later found out he was a dentist.

1417	317	1	As I add to my experiences as a patient , I am increasingly intrigued by post-operative advice. No evidence is given for most of the instructions and it is way OTT compared with the common sense approach of years gone by. I have been browsing through some of the recommendations across the board. In my own field I would never have suggested to a patient having a colonoscopy + polypectomy that lifting a 5lbs weight was taboo (What ? No overcoat in cold weather?) so have become even less inclined now to have that procedure.... Being advised to walk less than a mile a day for 2 weeks after cystoscopic polypectomy seems to be increasing the risk of DVT. Driving remains subject to some bizarre restrictions - discuss with your insurance company +/- GP after any GA and a wide variety of operations. My impression (after a THR) was that the insurance company did not want to know - OK no driving for 48 hrs after GA (judgement possibly impaired) and no driving after certain operations until confident about emergency stopping....but those are common sense instructions and ignoring them likely to lead to a problem whether or not a phone call made to the insurance company or seen by GP (see your GP is becoming the least practical of all suggestions. A face to face discussion took nearly 3 months last time).<br /><br /> What drives doctors to connive in these instructions - is it because they feel the quality of life of patients is of little concern in line with the general trend? Is it because somehow it boosts the significance of their interventions ? Is it because of some misconception about medico-legal matters? Is it because there is competition with the increasingly cuckoo advice put out by physicians and pharmacistsand medical treatment and possible (just possible , at least in theory ) interactions?<br /><br /> The net result of including some cuckoo advice along with the relevant is that the entire package comes in for ridicule. There is much to be said for EBM - surely we owe it to our patients not to limit their lives without good reason? And if these restrictions do have an adequate rationale then it needs to be evidence based and explained before surgery .	sken	2016-03-30 09:46:00	0	0
1418	317	1	I was recently the recipient of some 'cuckoo' health and safety concerns. I had a Gastroscopy as an out patient and was impressed with the whole process. Great communication from Doctors and Nurses with me, quick procedure and given results straight after it was completed. But then it became a little bizarre. A short while after the Gastroscopy the nurse rechecked my BP, P Sats etc and all was well. I had not had sedation (indeed did not receive meds of any description) so she said I could leave as soon as I felt ready. She asked how I was getting home. Due to the dreadful lack of car parking facilities at the hospital I explained I had arranged to call my wife who would pull up outside the main hospital doors and I would jump in. The nurse was not pleased with this arrangement. 'Wouldn't it be better' she said 'if your wife came up to endoscopy reception and walked you down to the car'?. Once again I explained the car parking difficulties and that I felt perfectly well and had had no drugs to impair me. Nevertheless she said she would prefer it if my wife walked me down. I enquired why she felt it necessary for my wife to walk me down. She said that if I suddenly felt unwell or collapse I might fall and injure myself. I asked her whether she thought I was likely to collapse or fall, did she know something I didn't? She said I would probably be fine but if I fell or tripped the hospital might be liable.<br /><br /> I found this logic peculiar. What happens to all the people coming and going throughout the day at the hospital? Are they all supervised lest they trip or fall? I reassured her that I would take the utmost care navigating the perilous route from endoscopy reception to the car and should I come a cropper would absolve the hospital of responsibility.<br /><br /> One can understand such concerns had I been elderly or infirm. Or had some medical problem that might affect my balance but this just seemed OTT. <br /><br /> Needless to say I did manage to get to the car without mishap or crisis and arrived home in one piece.<br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2016-03-30 11:01:00	0	0
1419	317	1	"kirked - glad you made it.... My experience last year was similar. A minor procedure (joint injection) for which some patients are given a whiff of something but which I declined. Afterwards told I was not ""allowed"" to stand up until I had had something to eat or drink. The nursing hostility to my pointing out that I had NOT had any sedative made absolutely no difference. Clearly I was an awkward patient in their eyes and I was already aware that I might need another injection at some stage. I was tempted to just get up and go but that would have meant major confrontation. The point of my original post was that much of what is now told to patients seems to have very little evidence base - at bit like the ""No conkers"" for school children. Nothing to do with official Health and Safety"" but more reflecting a level of panic lower down the line. And for many nurses a rule is a rule and any questioning a matter of heresy. <br /><br /> I was much reassured to see that a primary school which owns a bit of wild land , not far from here , teaches Stoneage crafts (including making bows and arrows) and clay pigeon shooting etc... along with the usual curriculum.

1421	317	1	It is certainly worrying how some staff seem to regard any challenge or questioning to mean that the patient is 'difficult' or even aggressive.  People and organisations that can't allow, let alone welcome, questioning and challenging are unable to learn and improve.  Perhaps assessing suitability for working in (or running) the Health Service should include testing the responses to being robustly questioned and challenged.<br /><br /> This is one of the things that concerns me about the current obsession with the need to train leaders.  If you look at the articles trying to justify this (the evidence is extremely thin) it becomes clear that the idea is mostly for people who will 'persuade' others to follow centrally-driven plans for the Health Service, however cuckoo and damaging those are.

More and more I think we need to be in touch with what is happening in Medicine outside the UK . I see our posts as concentrating on  UK  issues but that is because we do no have enough feeding in from the wider world. Besides the type of problems and challenges we face in the UK are not totally dissimilar to many of those in other countries.	sken	2016-03-23 16:39:00	1	0

1438	320	1	Last April a Northern Irish woman who bought pills over the internet to induce an abortion was given a suspended three month prison sentence. The woman had told her housemates that she tried to travel to England for a termination but could not cover her costs. She had then been told by a clinic about mifepristone and misoprostol, available on the internet that would induce a miscarriage. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> The Abortion Act 1967 does not apply in NI. Under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, anyone carrying out an abortion in Northern Ireland, except under some extremely limited circumstances, can be jailed for life. Last year the High Court in NI ruled that current legislation is in breach of The Human Rights Act. The NI government however are extremely unlikely to adhere to such rulings - politics in NI is deeply mixed with religious affiliation. There have been a number of high profile cases across the island of Ireland involving abortion and in 2012 the case of Dentist Savita Halappanavar (see http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2232676/Savita-Halappanavar-dies-Irish-doctors-refuse-abortion-saying-This-Catholic-country.html ) saw people protesting on parliament.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The Republic of Ireland also has strict abortion laws. Just this week a United Nations human rights committee called on the ROI to reform its law on abortion, after holding that the country’s virtual ban on abortion subjected a woman to cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment, violating her human rights. A UN panel of experts found that Ireland’s virtual ban on abortion had forced Amanda Mellet to choose “between continuing her non-viable pregnancy or travelling to another country while carrying a dying foetus, at personal expense, and separated from the support of her family, and to return while not fully recovered.”<br /><br />  <br /><br /> This is an emotive issue and much more time and space would be required to outline the complexities of Irish politics (and I am not remotely an expert) but I wonder how this can play out. Those demanding legislation be put in line with the rest of the UK are passionate about women's rights but so too are those who see abortion as immoral.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Is there any common ground?

I also authored a post in BMJ blogs about the doctors strike in Colombia. I believe it is necessary to update my own story as well as the events related with labor unions and doctor strikes in Colombia.<br /><br />  <br /><br />    (i) About my story: a judge ordered about 6 weeks ago my reintegration to my previous job post at the Universidad del Valle protecting me with the constitutional rights of forced labor stability, due process, and health. I am grateful for the opportunities of life because two and a half years ago I was hospitalized at the HUV because of an ""acute psychosis"", ""paranoia"", and ""delusions of persecution"" about pharmaceutical companies (maybe for some psychiatrists you have to be delusional to not believe in the altruism and generosity of pharmaceutical companies. It is quite ironic, that short lasting (< 2 days) psychiatric hospitalization allowed me to be elected the last week as president (i.e., legal representative) of the association of users (i.e., patients) at the Hospital Universitario del Valle (HUV). In addition, about 4 weeks ago I presented a lecture of antipsychotics to medical students of Univalle. We (Asousuarios HUV) would like to review thoroughly  the price of medicines at the HUV. (1) This situation reminds me the title of a paper published on The BMJ: ""Let the patient revolution begin"": <br /><br />  <br /><br />(ii) Update: the doctor’s strike in Colombia<br /><br />  <br /><br />    Events of discomfort continue: a major focus of tensions between workers and the government (mainly at the departmental level - Valle del Cauca) is the Hospital Universitario del Valle ""Evaristo García"" - HUV (Cali, Colombia). The HUV is the largest public hospital in the southwestern region of Colombia, Dr. Ricardo Gallego president SIMAC - Sindicato Médico Nacional (translation: National Labor Union of Doctors) have called to an open assembly to discuss the situation of the HUV, it have unfortunately become a center of propaganda by some unscrupulous politicians. Asousuarios HUV endorses Dr. Gallego in his call for a general assembly at the hospital - now it is a movement of doctors organized through a legally constituted labor union (SIMAC) with the support of patients - users of the medical services at the HUV.<br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />    <br /><br />Jorge R.<br /><br />     <br /><br />    --<br /><br />     <br /><br />    References<br /><br />    1.

1451	325	1	I imagine you have heard about the forced closure of up to 3,000 (1 in 4) pharmacies in the UK from October 2016 – but have you considered the impact on the medical profession? The impact on GP surgeries, A&E departments and the medical profession generally will be MASSIVE. If pharmacies are unable to cope, they could have no choice but to refer patients to their GP and/or A&E. This could lead to a dangerous game of healthcare tennis. The NHS could crumble under the pressure, and the workload increase for doctors and nurses could be incredible, irreparably damaging the medical profession (who would want to work under those conditions?)<br /><br /> As background, the government recently announced cuts to pharmacy funding of £170m over 6 months, equivalent to £340m on an annual basis (a 12.2% cut). NHS prescription items will grow by 2.5% in the same period. Across an entire primary healthcare sector (community pharmacy), that’s HUGE.<br /><br /> Pharmacy minister Alistair Burt said that up to 3,000 pharmacies could close, with smaller independents more likely to suffer. This appears to be anti-small business and could have a dreadful impact on local communities who rely upon the pharmacy.<br /><br /> The remaining pharmacies will be under much greater pressure, which could have a massive impact on patient safety. They will still need to dispense 1 billion NHS items per year between them and will likely cut staff, even if they do have the space to cope with the extra prescriptions. Patients will probably have to travel further and vulnerable patients could be put at risk (e.g. housebound, disabled, blind patients). People could be deprived of accessible medicines advice and support from trusted pharmacists. Free services such as prescription deliveries may be stopped.<br /><br /> A petition against the cuts already has 50,000 signatures but needs 100,000 signatures to get a debate in parliament. Ultimately I’m making this post to ask for your help with the petition and to raise awareness as I’m not sure everyone realises how bad this government decision is - for patients, doctors, pharmacists and the NHS generally.<br /><br />https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/116943 (also accessible via the short link bit.ly/savemypharmacy)	esurfer	2016-03-21 15:43:00	1	0
1452	325	1	Many thanks - I had totally missed this one and had thought pharmacy services were being expanded despite entrenched opposition from the medical professio. I have signed the petition.

1454	326	1	The MDU is currently giving advice on consent following the Montgomery case (reminder : risk of shoulder dystocia in patient with risk factors). As usual much of the MDU advice is impractical in the hustle and bustle of day-to-day life , but there is a very relevant point in emphasising that consent has to be what one might call ad hominem - that is tailored to the individual. This I think is a fundamental point. It means that postal consent , information sheets about procedures etc.. have a more limited value than often supposed even if studies suggest these are acceptable to groups of patients.<br /><br />  The practicalities and overall functioning of the NHS is not the concern of those giving legal opinions but these judgements do leave the jobbing doctor in a difficult position. <br /><br /> Just how we cope is unclear but I suspect we will have to go on much as before driven by clinical pressures and weighing these against the risk of legal action. It might be interesting to see just how much operating time would be lost if surgeons , anaesthetists and endoscopists etc.. as well as obstetricians. really did go through full consent rituals every time. What will happen of course is that time will be given to those who demand it , with the usual rider that it will be taken from others. And of course however long one spends on consent and however ideally it is carried out , there will be no guarantees that a complaint will not be forthcoming . <br /><br /> Good luck to those still working - as a patient on a number of occasions , I can't say that I have ever experienced the level of information suggested nor had an appointment where there would have been anywhere near enough time to go through the issues involved. When having a procedure I see that I am mainly responsible for information gathering and i am very critical of those prepared to leap on to an operating table having done less of this than they would if buying - for example- a new lawnmower. For those lacking capability or capacity other arrangements are needed , but perhaps we should not always take the lowest common denominator as the determinant of good practice ?	sken	2016-04-20 19:59:00	0	0
1455	327	1	This isn't really much about medicine but is an interesting issue. For the last few weeks newspapers and TV news have followed an injunction from the High Court banning them naming a male celebrity who allegedly had a liaison with two other people. To breach an injunction and thereby be in Contempt of Court can have serious implications for Journalists, proprietors and publishers; a heavy fine and custodial sentence strong possibilities.<br /><br /> However, the current 'super injunction' has essentially been undermined because a newspaper in the Republic of Ireland and various Internet sites (in the USA, China, Canada and Europe) have already published the celebrities' name. Judges in the UK can only enforce laws within its jurisdictions. Clearly the internet and social media have proliferated enormously over the last two decades since the Human rights Act came into force and a senior Judge yesterday essentially implied he would lift the injunction subject to an appeal by the celebrities' lawyer.<br /><br /> Such injunctions are used almost exclusively by rich 'celebrities' (often famous for being famous and not having contributed anything very substantial to society), footballers and the like but how much do the public need to know about someone's private life? Frequently such injunctions are used to keep extramarital affairs secret or other behaviour that one would not find very appealing. Should such folk have the right to privacy? What type of information is genuinely of public interest rather than of interest to the public? Do people have a prurient interest in people's private lives?<br /><br /> The current injunction remains in place but one survey (referenced by the Court) showed that 1:5 people questioned knew the name of the celebrity involved. Indeed it has been very simple to discover his identity online.<br /><br /> Would it be acceptable for a well known Doctor to take out a super injunction to protect his reputation if it was discovered he had behaved in a scandalous way in his private life quite at odds with what he professes to be in public?<br /><br /> Just curious to see what folk might think of this issue.<br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2016-04-19 12:02:00	0	0

1458	328	1	As I follow it ,  in the sex discriminatory argument (refuted by the Dept of Health) it was argued that week-end working was discriminatory against women because these may be single parents etc... An argument frequently used in other contexts. The implication being that women should not be obliged to work week-ends or be paid more for so doing. Presumably too this applies to any out-of-hours work. An extrapolation of this argument might be that Jewish doctors be excused Saturday work , Christians for Sundays etc... to avoid religious discrimination.  <br /><br /> Although the DoH may have phrased its answer badly , I am left with the feeling that the unfairness is less to do with true unfairness than to do with trying to oppose the new contract with every conceivable argument.	sken	2016-04-02 19:50:00	0	0

1460	328	1	John - As I said , badly phrased. The point remains that if we are to see women disadvantaged by having to do out-of-hours work , then that has major implications for their training and possibly for their career prospects. Since this disadvantage is seen as a matter of principle , it cannot be corrected by financial adjustment. <br /><br />  Besides , in training perhaps the ends can sometimes justify the means - my working long and antisocial hours (the means) to some extent justified the ends (a career in the specialty of my choice)..

1461	329	1	"A 30 year old woman who has requested sterilisation for the past five years has now been told she can have the procedure undertaken soon. In an interesting case she says her GP has denied her the right to sterilisation because she might regret it. Last year she said :<br /><br />  <br /><br /> 'For the record, the reason I don’t want children is both simple and complex. I just don’t want them. I never have. You could perhaps attribute this to the fact that my mum actually had a sterilisation after I was born, but was talked into having a reversal and three more children by the man she married after my dad, since he didn’t have any of his own. She loves us, of course, but her energy and finances have been drained for more than 30 years by children. “I don’t regret any of you,” she says often, “but what you don’t have you don’t miss. I’ve explained all this and more to the doctors I’ve asked to sterilise me. When they’ve talked about the fulfilment that children bring, I’ve explained that I already have a longer list of things I want to do than I could possibly achieve in a lifetime. When they’ve told me I’ll feel differently when I find “the one”, I’ve explained that my “one” wouldn’t want kids either – and that I’d want to focus on being their partner, not the mother of their children. When they’ve casually called me selfish – more than once – I’ve explained that I’m a blood donor, an organ donor, a bone marrow donor, and even tried to give my unwanted eggs to childless couples – only to be told they’re not suitable because I’m a carrier for cystic fibrosis. Even this didn’t sway them. Reason after solid reason, and still they’ve rejected me every year since the age of 26. What are the magic words I need to say to convince a GP that this really is what I want? Every year for the last four years my GP has refused my decision. I couldn't even get a referral. The response was always: ""You’re far too young to take such a drastic decision.""' <br /><br />  <br /><br /> I can understand her GP would want to ensure she made an informed decision but is it right to deny her the procedure if she is determined it is what she wants? I find myself supporting the patient in this case. She certainly might regret the procedure in the future but one can regret many things in life. Despite being sterilised she might still be able to have a child further down the line if a reversal is successful.

1463	329	1	Kirked<br /><br /> Whilst clinicians don't have to comply with all requests for referrals or interventions I've always understood that, if that happens, they should ask if the patient would like another opinion (which is what a referral is really all about anyway).  It may well be that some women would regret a decision to lose ability to have children but I suspect there are at least as many who later regret the decision to have had them!

1464	329	1	I heard this lady  telling her story on the radio, and she argues well for her PoV.    I fear that the attitude of gynae surgeons is biased by their experience of  people, men and women, who get sterilised and then regret it, often because the operation was a part of marital breakdown and with new partners fertility is wanted again.  Surgeons always insist that steriliation must be considered permanent, which is what this woman wants, but their mind set is fixed on fickle human nature.   I can't quote the success ratio of reconstructions, but it's not great, and no one likes to say 'my surgery is unlikely to be sucessful'.<br /><br /> And, female sterilisation always needs general anaesthesia, which cannot be undertaken lightly.    In the interview, she said that her long term male partner had been offered vasectomy, under LA with lesser risk, but that was not acceptable.  She didn't explain why.<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-03-27 11:26:00	0	0
1465	329	1	Many thanks all,<br /><br /> I think when talking of 'Doctors' she is referring to General Practitioners. The newspaper article I linked is just a few days old and seems to indicate her dissatisfaction with the attitudes of different GP's she has consulted. She is clearly an intelligent, well informed patient who is categorical about her wish for sterilisation having fully understood that tubal ligation should be regarded as irreversible. As far as I ascertain from the article she is in a long term relationship with a young man who doesn't wish to have a vasectomy and she does not wish to use hormonal medication to render her unable to conceive.<br /><br /> I think Maxim highlights an important point. Would it not have been proper for her GP to say to the patient 'whilst I am reluctant to support you in securing sterilisation because you are too young and may very well regret such a decision I will refer you to my colleague who might be more willing to assist you'. If she decided to be sterilised privately would she still require her GP's referral?<br /><br /> Kirked	kirked	2016-03-28 07:28:00	0	0
1466	329	1	I hope GPS will forgive me but their role is often as 'gatekeeper' to hospital services.  So delegation to those specialists may be felt to be dodging their responsi abilities.<br /><br /> If her partner was unwilling to consider vasectomy then they must take responsibilty for the problem too.  Vasectomy is easily tolerated and done under LA.  Reversal takes much longer and GA is preferred.  Either operation is minor in terms of stress and risk, being entirely external and to superficial structures.   When his partner was as definite and determined, why was he not willing to u dergo this trivial procedure?<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-03-28 08:35:00	0	0
1467	329	1	Certainly the world is full of people who knew totally 100% what they wanted until they   didnt<br /><br /> The death risk from the GA/Lap sterilisation is low but not zero.  The male having a vasectomy could be killed by a meteorite but  it remains a safer procedure . Mirena insertion takes usually 2-3 minutes of doctor time  plus does have to be repeated every five years  and could be a bit of a nuisance for some.<br /><br /> Beyond age 30 is usually enough for most guidelines to consider TL. The coroner would  certainly question why  a tubal ligation was allowed if there was a disaster in a younger person (The vasectomy refuser may also rethink things)<br /><br /> .A private opinion would be routine if public hospital guidelines are  not met.	rcdeacon	2016-03-30 18:55:00	0	0

1471	330	1	"The Junior Doctors will go out on strike next month, from emergency work as well as routine.    No doubt the consultants will be there to maintain emergency services, and I doubt if any doctor will call them blacklegs for doing so.  (For anyone not steeped in UK social history, a blackleg is one who works while others are on strike)<br /><br /> But what about recently retired doctors, especially those who still work part-time?   Should they agree if asked, or even offer to work, to support their erstwhile colleagues and the even harder-pressed service, while their junior ex-colleagues are the strikers?<br /><br /> The ethics would seem to be the same as a doctor faced with a street accident.  She has no duty of care to the casualty and  must not profess an expertise she does not have.      If she does volunteer she must exert the same diligence as for any other patient, within the resources available whihc may be limited.   So there is no need to do so.<br /><br /> It may be argued that it is in the interest of the Juniors struggle to prevent any emergency patient sufferiing mishap due to the strike, so on that ground should our protagonist volunteer?  Equally, a strike's intention  is to damage the employer's profits, of which there  are none in the NHS, so perhaps the credibility, the reputation of the employer, as a reliable provider of the service?  So if there are queues of bleeding, chest clutching patient outside hospitals, will that not also further the Junior's case?  <br /><br /> I fear not;  several right wing newspapers are already getting the knife in:  The Sun, ""champagn swilling lavish lifestyles enjoyed by striking ""Moet-Medics"""" ; Daily Mail ""strike could close A&E departments"".   The dispute will win or lose on the support of the public - if they think that their immedaute safety is threatened, they will lose all support fior the Juniors.<br /><br /> John"	John D	2016-03-24 15:00:00	0	0
1472	330	1	I have been thinking through this one as well. Although not now in a position to return to work , I am fairly sure i would have done so if asked. Striking over emergencies is not a good tactic - even though some 80% of those attending A&E may not be emergencies in the true sense. Will doctors really refuse to see and help for true emergencies ? Many years ago I recall very senior managers pushing for cross cover at a junior level on the grounds that a doctor is a doctor , so eg paediatrics could be covered by the general medicine team etc... Later on of course there was the pressure for a consultant based service , but many of those now having to stand in may not feel at home in the hustle and bustle of A&E outside their specialty. Cover may be provided but not at all A&E departments. Besides there will be folk out there who may refuse to work outside contracted hours although I expect there is a clause about the exigencies of the service etc...<br /><br /> The rosy view of the public that when the crunch comes doctors would not walk out on emergencies is about to be broken and that is bad news. It is not just the right wing press that is pointing out pay rates . In the little Independent to-day the point is made that juniors may be being paid up to £70K. Merely pointing this out emphasises the view that this is now a tussle over money. <br /><br /> John D - If you do go back to work and see it reasonable to give an anaesthetic to help a child have a broken leg treated etc... you would have my support. Not that that is worth much these days....	sken	2016-03-24 20:13:00	0	0
1473	330	1	Thank you, sken!  For your support, and your thoughts.      I think that I will wait and see.  If an ex-colleague asks me to help, I'll go like a shot.    If a manager asks, I'll see if those ex-colleagues 'approve' that the request is genuine.   My reasons are those that I discussed last - better that I go, rather than a junior, or that the patient suffers, because that would be gold dust to the press and Hunt.<br /><br /> Juniors may earn £70K - consultants may earn nearly £200K.   Few do, although they can be typified by the press.<br /><br /> I hope that local discussions are taking place on priorities and definitions.  I read that juniors are suspicous that managers will call anything up to a Major Incident to get them back in, and what about the 'urgents', the cancers?     If they lose out we are lost, politically.  And those in A&E with sore toes - will they be redirected to their GPs?  I do not fancy being a GP then - they will be snowed under, as if they weren't already.<br /><br /> John	John D	2016-03-24 22:24:00	0	0
1474	330	1	John<br /><br /> It might be interesting to hear the views of some junior doctors who would be involved in the next strike; I'm not sure if you've asked any outside this thread.  I've not heard any of the juniors expressing views either way about current or retired Consultants doing what would usually be done by juniors.<br /><br /> If your offering or agreeing to help out is purely in the spirit of preventing harm coming to patients and is done without any comment on the ethics of striking I would be surprised if you came in for any serious criticism.<br /><br /> I doubt that Consultants would strike because of forthcoming changes to their contracts but if that did happen in any numbers there might be a considerable added problem of some juniors not being able to work either because they would be unsupervised.<br /><br /> Tabloid arguments about  what some juniors can earn seem to me to be irrelevant and are best ignored as far as possible.  I would have to take a similar attitude to mentions of tabloid (can't remember which) claims about eye-watering hourly rates of pay for some GPs working in A/E to help the crises there.<br /><br /> This presumably comes down to who will blink first.  As you hint in another recent thread, JH could well be increasingly under pressure.  I don't know about whiskey and revolver; enough rope could be enough.  I was intrigued by the title of the recent BMJ interview with JH: 'still a safe pair of hands?'.  The word 'still' seems a strange choice.

1475	331	1	"Sir Bruce Keogh, whose review of weekend mortality in the NHS many believe was hijacked by Hunt to back the Tory's political wish for a 7/7 NHS, spoke at a meeting at Guy's Campus.   He said that there was ""good clinical consensus” among all doctors for a 7/7 NHS but that, “where this became derailed was when the seven-day services was loosely linked in some way to a discussion about junior doctors.” He said that, “Where it did need a focus on people was primarily around consultant support” <br /><br />It appears that he meant by that more consultants in the hospital at weekends, rather than more support staff in paramedical services, the other criticism of the Hunt approach.   But with the criticism of such emininents as Sir Bruce chipping away, can Hunt long survive?   The Tory's Budget is falling about their ears and Ian Duncan Smith has fallen on his sword.   Should they present Hunt with a bottle of whisky and a revolver, so that he can do the decent thing?<br /><br />John"	John D	2016-03-25 10:56:00	0	0
1476	332	1	This was a question at my latest pre-anaesthetic assessment recently. I presumed there was some other point behind the question other than provincial prejudices of anaesthetists in the South. What was unclear was just what infection was being chased - the extremely high incidence of hep C in Manchester ? Their problems with respitratory viruses? Last year's scare about Ebola? When I think about the questions that could have been asked this one intrigued me . <br /><br /> DOI  All my immediate forebears come from that neck-of-the woods.<br /><br /> PS John D - it really is time that anaesthetists pushed themselves into a proper role of clinical importance and not just act as surgical accessories , albeit highly skilled. I will only find out who is anaesthetising me just before surgery. For me the individual is always potentially just as important as the surgeon and what anxieties I have relate to the anaesthesia not to what the surgeon may do or find , although I am aware of the implications. Particularly relevant as I have postponed surgery largely because I did not want to be just told I would have another spinal (bad trip last time) and specified a GA . I see it as so relevant that it even influences my choice of hospital - stymied because the hospital I would have chosen , with 2 anaesthetists of choice , has just closed and the other chap I would have wanted has retired......	sken	2016-03-12 14:57:00	0	0
1477	332	1	"Sken,<br /><br /> I didn't ignore you, really I didn't.  I wrote a thoughtful, insightful piece, reflecting on the role of the anaesthetist and how it has developed from a part-time novelty to a full specialty that almost no other specialty can do without. And my cursed computer lost it!    I must have pressed the wrong keys - I have a newish keyboard and sometimes (I think) I press the control key by mistake.     The Microsoft equivalent of Tutankhamen's Curse, the CTRL codes, take over and do things that were never asked.   So my deathless prose is lost, and I can't bear to try and recreate it, sorry!<br /><br /> But I used to run an Anaesthesia Clinic.   Its constituency was the Pre-Op. Assessment Clinic, and the occasional direct surgical or even GP referral, and its role was to assess and advise people who faced high risks from surgery.    To do them justice, and because often ""no surgery"" was an option to be considered, I saw six to eight patients in one session each week.     I hope, and believe from feedback, that those people were often grateful for this service.<br /><br /> So, if you want to have a good chat with an anaesthetist before surgery, and don't mind if it's not actually your anaesthetist, tell the POA nurses all about your dreadful chest pain, previous strokes (and miraculous recovery), airway problems at previous anaesthetics and family history of malignant hyperpyrexia.   An appointment in the Anaesthesia Clinic will follow!<br /><br /> John"	John D	2016-03-15 22:54:00	0	0
1478	332	1	"John D - thanks. My recent experience (yesterday) with an anaesthetist was much more pleasant than the previous one. He even smiled from time to time and called in later to see how I was faring.... My impression is that the specialty includes a gamut from the primarily technician through the ""human"" and so on to those who eventually move to pain relief and pain clinics.<br /><br />  In gastroenterology we have 'scope pushers and listeners at the 2 ends of the spectrum. I think most of us aimed for a middle road - and have passed much of the routine 'scope work over to nursing colleagues - and where funds are available quite a bit of the listening as well.<br /><br />  I remember hearing about a study at St T's a couple of years ago where all those (I think 65+) were admitted for a 1/2 day for full assessment. I remember thinking that I did not want to go a place that could not bring common sense into the equation and was so dismissive that some of us might have better things to do - I can't remember just how many , if any ,of the significant findings were found in low risk patients..<br /><br /> Very sorry about the computer - you are not alone in such mishaps - but many thanks for responding.

1495	336	1	"I think this need for interaction has long been recognised. When I was working at the Clinical Research Centre at Harrow back in the 1970s the aim was to have folk from different backgrounds - including Heinz Wolff and bioengineering - interacting from the viewpoint of different disciplines. Exposure to those with an interest in sports and music as well as literature has featured throughout much of my life. As a DGH physician there was also a group that met regularly with those from the University to look at ways in which different scientific departments could interact with hospital departments. Clearly there were financial incentives for the non-medical groups.in such research projects in terms of obtaining funding..<br /><br /> Any forum that encourages such interaction is to be welcomed. I do not think this needs to be just at the levels of ""experts"" - some of the more relevant ideas which need exploring or where the opportunities for interaction may be most profitable could well come from those in the fromt line. Perhaps doc2doc should also register /flag up that a number of medics also have degrees in eg physics or highly specialised interests such as musicians and their occuaptional problems.<br /><br /> As regards those planning on literary endeavours some practical advice can be useful - most now seem to research their work reasonably well - but there can be clashes in underlying aims : story or message?

I would not want it to start being taken over as a site for the primarily frivolous comments as might appear on other sites."	sken	2015-08-29 19:38:00	1	0
1500	337	1	Sabreena<br /><br /> Are you able to tell us a little more about the reasons why the BMJ is 'considering changing the way it provides community'?<br /><br /> I'm sorry if I'm avoiding answering all your five questions (still thinking) but doc2doc offers a very different type of interaction from, say the blogs or the rapid responses.  The bloggers sometimes post very good stuff but it seems to be a minority who respond to comments.  This may be why so few blogs now get comments! Rapid responses might need more change than doc2doc but you're not asking about that. <br /><br /> Doc2doc offers better, nearly real-time, themed conversation than the other platforms.  In addition to the good suggestions from others I would ask that 'the rules' be made more visible and concise.  They might include the requirement that everyone posting a question or request for advice must respond to the posts received.  This doesn't always happen but seems to be simple professional courtesy that gets overlooked by a few social media 'butterflies'.

1501	337	1	"A few rambling thoughts here. I don't use the BMJ journal website much, I like the paper journal as I can scribble & highlight on it more easily. Some of these features may already exist on there, apologies if they do. I personally like to have everything all in one place so Id prefer if the BMJ commeng came into d2d rather than them having their own seperately site (I like only having to keep an eye on one website)<br /><br />  <br /><br /> My concern of moving to an exclusive comments on stories in the BMJ style is that it would restrict our topics to those covered in the journal. Many of the discussions on D2D (esp those I tend to engage more with) are based on news articles, items from other journals, new guidelines, clinical problems & life / career advice. Tying D2D more strongly into the BMJ website would cut out much of this. <br /><br /> I don't mind suggestions on what I've previously liked or commented on (not just read as i often open a page, read a few lines to get the gist then realise it's not for me). As you can only see the 10 most recent posts sometimes you miss out on a topic oh might be interested in if you've been away for a day.<br /><br /> It would be nice to unfollow a topic to stop it appearing in the recent discussions widget. For example... There might be a few popular discussions about an adult topics which are all active & so taking up several of the spaces in the recent discussions. Can I click that I'm not interested in that and it then disappears (& doesn't return) from the widget so I can see new things I might like (like when you leave a discussion in Facebook to stop getting all the notifications about it)<br /><br /> The doc2doc search has always been unreliable. Perhaps a keywords system where people can nominate upto 5 keywords would help simple searching. I might tag my recent returning to work discussion with ""maternity, return to work, advice, career, family"", whereas a ""hardcore"" clinical paper could use the article MESH keywords. Visitors could then be offered a ""popular discussions"" word cloud to see hot topics on search for particular terms. <br /><br /> If people are discussing an article from BMJ group (not just BMJ but ADC etc) perhaps an option to auto link the abstract into the opening post with link to the journal (I read an article online, want to discuss, click ""discuss"" and the widardry takes me to an open discussion if there is one, or using a template starts one with the abstract already in which then appears on D2D). You can then have 2 recent discussion widgets: ""from the journals"" and ""freelance"" (or whatever catchy name suits those that aren't discussing articles).<br /><br />  <br /><br /> for those articles from journals, the ability to link those articles & your participation into your BMJ learning portfolio (or even better my NHS eportfolio) so I can quickly & easily link ""I've read this & actively discussed it"" for my portfolio<br /><br /> and finically can we PLEASE get the mobile site fixed so I can view it with my phone portrait, Its the only site I have to view & use landscape as its not resizeable and the discussion column doesn't fit in portrait!<br /><br /> hope that's some ideas to be getting on with!

1502	337	1	My responses:<br /><br /> 1.  I would not like for do2doc to be more clsoely tied to the BMJ contnents.  The wide scipe of posts are a unique feature of doc2doc.  Instant comments on articles are available at the BMJ and need not be duplicated on doc2doc.<br /><br /> 2.  i really like the sense of community of the posts on doc2doc and the wide scope of the posts.  i particularly like the posts on some of the social/entical issues of medical practice and the attempts to improve health care.  i am always disapointed in the low number of responses compared to the number of views.  Any attempts to increase the number of responses would be welcomed.  A more vigorous feedback function might be helpful tied not just to responses to my posts, but also new posts in an area that i have an interest in.<br /><br /> 3.  There have been times when the fora have been captured by a few individuals whit posts of marginal import.  There also have been some posts that are commercial in contennt.  however, this comes with the teritory and the level of policing appears about right.<br /><br /> 4.  Severalhave mentioned a more robust surch function.  i think that rather than new features, i would prefer looking at the current fora and see if they meet the needs of our readers.  New fora on early aspects of a medical career come to midn.  also more esplicit fora to discuss social and ethical sapects of medicine would be interesting.<br /><br /> 5. An interesting idea.  it mihgt increase interaction among those with common interests.	diabetesMD	2015-08-31 07:52:00	0	0
1503	337	1	I do not believe that doc2doc website is a sister website of bmj.com.Its search engine is very poor I usually seek help from Google.The last technical glitch took more than 48 hours to restore the system.When an unwanted ad is placed on the page then it remains there for the whole day.Sometimes back I inquired about one of my old posts I was told that all old posts have been deleted.Sometimes very intelligent questions are asked by clinicians and non-medical personnel’s ----------in such cases the editors must extend their helping hand in looking for the answer.

1504	337	1	"A thought that i had last night in terms of making doc2doc more interactive and meaningful to our readers is the development of an ""Ask the clinician"" forum.  In this forum practitioners, students and trainees would have a site for their clinical questions.  The site would then have the capability to calorize the question by looking at key words and the question would be forwarded to one of our volunteer content experts for a response.  An example might be: “What would be your next choice of oral agents in a type 2 diabetic patient when metformin and a sulfonylurea failed to adequately control the glycemia?""  The question would be forwarded to a resident diabetes expert for response and any reader could see the question and response(s).  This would require a robust program to identify the topics and send a notification to the expert for a response.  However, it would certainly be a great way to be of service to our readers and to foster a sense of community."	diabetesMD	2015-09-01 04:03:00	1	0

1511	339	1	2 contrasting comments in the past few days. Firstly , Maureen Baker of the RCGP “It is deeply insulting and demeaning –as well as being highly unethical – to suggest that offering GPs money will change the way in which we care for our patients”. Money has featured greatly , and often for the good,  in the way  GPs care for their patients. Contracts have been negotiated on that basis. The precipitant – possible payments for not referring to hospital – is not something for such a self righteous response but for information and audit on the inappropriateness of referrals. If this is happening - then why : poor guidelines , more training needed , complaining patients always seen as in the right etc...<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The second full feature article by a GP in the Guardian / Observer was against the evils of private practice. Totally different from GPs : hospital doctors do things because of the money. The evils listed will be well known to many of us and it is time we tackled them more forcefully –but not on a doctrinal basis. No mention of the frustration of some doctors when they are discouraged from seeing patients on the NHS even by running unpaid extra clinics. No mention of using private sessions to raise money to improve services for all patients etc…  And the usual issue about whether a UK taxpayer should lose rights to NHS services if seen privately. It has never been so crucial to try to establish an ethical way in which the MHS and private sectors can compliment each other – my impression is that it happens already more often than we realise.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Both systems have evils which we need to tackle (it is not a problem of recognition) – but doctors are not influenced by money ……	sken	2015-10-05 11:59:00	0	0
1512	339	1	Thnak you sken, for having jogged my memory of your post about this!     And for the clue to trace the Guardian article to one by Gavin Francis last month. It's worth reading, as it raises several points about the way that private practice, when alongside a health service such as the NHS, inevitably (?) leaches on those resources, to its own advantage and profit.     <br /><br /> See: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/02/profit-not-patients-risks-private-medicine<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-11-08 10:52:00	0	0
1513	339	1	I have no objection to people who wish to avail themselves of private facilities to do so. But, there should be a clear demarcation between NHS and private facilities and services. Likewise I do not see why a Doctor cannot clearly separate his NHS practice and private patients. As the article alludes to if he does not, then inevitably it leads to abuses of NHS facilities. But my real concern is safety and openness in private hospitals. So little is known about their safety records.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> There are about 1.61 million admissions annually to private hospitals and they are generally 'low risk' for surgery. Yet little is known about such hospitals performance data because unlike NHS trusts they do not have to supply it even though they do have CQC inspections. Private hospitals now receive about 28% of their income from treating NHS patients and around 6000 private patients a year are treated in NHS hospitals following complications from surgery in private hospitals. Between October 2010 and April 2014 802 unexpected deaths and 921 serious injuries were reported by private hospitals. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Can prospective patients make an informed judgement about whether to undergo surgery in a private hospital if they know very little about its facilities (such as Doctors immediately available in emergencies, critical care responses etc)? I wonder how many patients undergoing surgery are aware that if they develop complications overnight almost certainly an ambulance will be called to take them to the nearest A&E department. If NHS patients do have problems relating to surgery in private hospitals who do they address those concerns to? Where does the buck stop? It really isn't very clear. It is clear becoming a major issue because a group of lawyers have emerged specialising in medical negligence occurring in private hospitals. One major difference is that patients in private hospitals do have a contract with their Doctor in a private hospital whereas NHS patients do not. Suing for breach of contract can, therefore be undertaken.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The info here I have taken from The Centre for Health and the Public Interest report 2014 (the known and the unknown risks). It is a very helpful insight into Private hospitals gleaned by Freedom of Information Requests. It is about the only report I can think of which sheds some light on safety issues in private hospitals :<br /><br />  <br /><br />http://chpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CHPI-PatientSafety-Aug2014.pdf<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked	kirked	2015-11-09 11:51:00	0	0
1514	339	1	Thank you, Kirked!   That report should be read by all who take part in private practice.<br /><br /> It argues correctly that private hospitlas hould have to provide the same evidence of competence, good governnace and clinical effectiveness as the NHS, and I agree with you that consultants in PP should maintain a a clear seperation between their two practices,  and find some way to work with colleagues, to avoid isolation.    To that end, I recommend the Group Practice, which as an anaesthetist has many advantages, so many that I cannot understand why those in surgical specialties seem to be unable to achieve it.<br /><br /> Not only does it ensure independance from the NHS, as it allows you to work only when you have no NHS commitments, it answers any demand to work at another time, or when you are on leave, as a colleague can take up the work to no detriment to yourself.  While it is right to be responsible for your patients post-op. perhaps overnight, it makes covering complications on the subsequent day or later easier and more expeditious, as a colleague will be in the hospital and can do so on your behalf.     In a Group of sufficient size, it can offer to provide all clinical services in your specialty to the private hospital, giving the Group a lever in collective bargaining that an individual cannot.    And a Group member behaving anomalously is more likely to be commented on to a fellow Group member.   <br /><br /> John	John D	2015-11-09 22:40:00	0	0
1515	339	1	"kirked - I too found this report very interesting. Most of the recommendations seem fairly straightforward but clearly better data is needed in the NHS as well. There is for example a world of difference between a transfer of an NHS patient having a routine operation in a private hospital who needs transfer for an unexpected problem for emergency reasons and one who is transferred for a relatively minor matter. After all even NHS hospitals taking emergencies may have to transfer patients for specialist services. Similarly those seen as private patients should not lose their NHS ""rights"" if emergencies arise.<br /><br /> Just how one overcomes the problem of complications from inappropriate surgery is unclear. It will become an increasing problem as the NHS tightens its indications for some procedures - not meaning that the procedure is unnecessary but because of needing to limit costs and because of pressures on facilities. Currently there is clearly a tendency at times to operate more readily in the private sector and if these patients then require emergency transfer they are to some extent ""gatecrashing"" the NHS. Equally , I had a private THR replacement recently for end stage disease - was told I should have had it done years ago - and was offered an NHS bed. The medical reasons for preferring to go privately were to ensure that the surgeon of choice did the operation. He works with a particular anaesthetist (not just allocated one from the group rota) . I also had a preference for a smaller unit without intensive throughput with increased risks of cross infection. My first choice hospital would have been a designated orthopaedic hospital which accepts many NHS patients but was just a bit too far away. It would of course have had all the drawbacks of limited back-up on site. Some might argue that hospitals of this type still have a very real part to play in the NHS and we need to be clear whether our prejudices are against specialist units or against the private sector.<br /><br />  I also happened to prefer a system where my notes were not necessarily put into the ownership of the hospital to be disseminated or sold on as felt fit but that is a wider issue.<br /><br />  I fully understood and accepted that if things went very wrong then I would be at a disadvantage , but then my advance decision rejects much of what modern medicine obliges doctors to do by way of resus.. The lack of on site back-up junior staff is a major problem and I accept that my own knowledge  has proved pretty useful during 2 admissions in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. But the same might have applied in an NHS hospital. I shudder to think about what might happen without some insider knowledge....<br /><br /> The crucial area not adequately assessed in the report is in the quality of nursing services. These are a major concern in both NHS and private sectors. I had the impression that the private sector is less reliant on agency staff but that increasingly nursing procedures in both sectors are more worrying than what is happening medically. It is after all the ward nurses who will be the first to pick up on something going amiss and if there is a lack of understanding then that might be a cause for significant complication.<br /><br /> Caveat emptor seems very relevant but a leaflet on the main pros and cons for those being admitted would seem feasible as part of consent. But the final decision might well be made on availibility of treatment for elective surgery and for social reasons eg a preference for a n open ward of side-room.."	sken	2015-11-10 11:40:00	0	0
1516	339	1	PS Those who feel that emergency NHS transfer from the private sector is inappropriate are I think on tricky ground - think the scenario of a patient being mobilised in the private sector who falls and breaks a leg or the patiient who has a PE soon after going home. Would one really argue that these patients should be denied NHS care? I cannot see that it will be posible to make a rule that where there is emergency need , patients would be turned away from the NHS back-up hospital. It would put the staff there in a pretty difficult position.<br /><br /> At the other extreme are the non-emergency problems - such as  an unsightly scar or inappropriate cosmetic surgery - arising from an operation carried out privately. Again where this is adjudged appropriate , NHS care seems OK - after all we would not refuse to treat someone with equally self-inflicted damage in other ways. What should be demonstrable is that there is no preferential NHS treatment or inappropriateiate pressures to do just that. The NHS needs to provide information on these issues - and perhaps we need to know about those examples where the private sector has bailed out the NHS.....	sken	2015-11-10 13:30:00	0	0
1517	339	1	I am delighted that sken had the surgeon and anesthetist of his choice, but may I correct (?), modify perhaps what he said about the latter 'being allocated from the Group rota'.     In my Group we have a rota, of course we do, so that the private hospital theatre and the surgeon know who will be there.  But it is a routine rota, in which a surgeon and an anaesthetist work regularly together as a team, interrupted only by their leave, not a random allocation.  Thsi may be more regular than in the NHS!    I believe that in my Department, buffeted by other rotas such as pain, Intensive and obstetric care, it is a minority of anaesthetists who have the same surgeon every week.<br /><br /> A Group provides for the replacement for a principal on leave or sick to be also known to the other clinician, as there are only so many sessions in the working week when an NHS consultant is free to take up some private work.  That is a great benefit, as the pressure to skive off and do a few cases at the Golden Brick isn't there - a colleague is doing it with no loss to the NHS, and the proceeds are shared.  So the alternates who can cover absences are limited, and you tend to work with the same other surgeon regularly too.<br /><br /> Group Practice is so good for the NHS that it should be the rule in any specialty with sufficient consultants.<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-11-10 17:06:00	0	0
1518	339	1	Many thanks sken,<br /><br /> I agree with you that patients should not in any way be penalised for requiring emergency admission to NHS hospitals after private hospital surgery. But I feel it is wrong that patients undergoing relatively routine surgery in private hospitals do not appear to be aware that complications stemming from the surgery may not be dealt with safely in the hospital they are in. As a lay person it is easy to assume that a hospital is a hospital and appropriately qualified and experienced Doctors are always available to identify problems and respond quickly to them. When in reality it may be that the patient is essentially in the same position as if they were suddenly taken unwell at home.<br /><br /> There should be minimum safeguards in place that caters for the type of surgery undertaken. Many private facilities do not have a CRASH team at all and the RMO may well be a locum who has no anaesthetic, surgical or even acute medicine education or training.<br /><br /> A friend of mine is the Senior Nurse of a private hospital in London that is most certainly at the top of the range of private healthcare. They have very strong links to a large prestigious University hospital and medical school and have superb facilities including ITU, CCU, HDU and recovery. I visited to see for myself the services offered and would have no qualms about undergoing major surgery there. If wealthy people use such services they most certainly get a first class experience and senior surgeons undertake ward rounds with a full junior team each day. I noted also that there are rarely nursing vacancies because nurses regard employment there as very prestigious. The nurses are highly experienced, have excellent post grad qualifications and are paid well. The ones I spoke to regarded it as in another league to the usual private hospitals. They utilise their skills in an acute care setting and have the added benefit of good staffing levels, access to further training, strong links to the NHS and good in organisation advancement prospects.<br /><br /> Your point about nursing in private hospitals is very important indeed. Invariably nurses pick up problems (or should) as they develop on wards because they are the ones with the patients most of the time. Their reaction to initial problems may define the outcome. Again the average lay person probably does not realise that nurses skills and abilities can vary widely. <br /><br /> For me the key message here is that it is only just that prospective patients should be able to make informed judgements about undergoing private hospital surgery. I would not like to see private facilities close. They provide a perfectly fair service to the market and why should people not be able to have particular surgery at a more convenient time for them? It is the hybrid system that concerns me. NHS patients should not be penalised because Surgeons abuse NHS facilities.<br /><br /> kirked	kirked	2015-11-11 11:43:00	0	0
1519	339	1	"kirked - Just what should be explained to patients - many private hospitals have fewer than 30 beds , so back up services are bound to be limited ; side rooms will not be subject to the same level of observation , so ""collapse"" is less likely to be noticed immediately ; the consultants concerned will have their major commitment elsewhere so will not be available on demand ; the hospitals are run for profit so corners will be cut ; resident doctors are unlikely to have the same level of skill and training as those doing more sought after jobs in NHS hospitals. <br /><br /> Anything in that lot that is not self-evident ? Anyone who has had any contact with any form of the news media in the past 5 years will surely not believe ""a hospital is a hospital"". As with trust in the integrity of doctors and competence of hospitals people  persist in their beliefs (and possibly including religion) because they cannot cope with the alternative. <br /><br /> For those undergoing the usual run of routine operations , the consent form and information leaflet already include list of the main likely complications - I had mine long before admission - and all patients have to do is to ask the ""what if "" question. As happened often enough when I consented patients in the NHS.<br /><br /> Now there will be folk who believe that if you pay for something it will be better than if it is free - but that is a Society problem and medical care is perhaps little different from other aspects of consumerism - in this respect at least. All I would ask is that people ask the same questions as they might if eg buying a car or a washing machine and asking about back-up , warranties etc... People are quite capable of this and perhaps we should stop pretending it is always our medical responsibility to go into the detail. But make sure they have the opportunity to ask the questions."	sken	2015-11-11 13:12:00	0	0
1520	339	1	Kirked, Sken,<br /><br /> There must be many, if not all Trusts where the hospitals in the group are all independently capable of dealing with all likely complications.   They will all have smaller or more remote units where patient selection must be exerted to reduce the complication rate to a minimum and where arrangements must be in place for transfer if necessary.    If the smallest, which includes many private hospitals, take similar precautions, where do you draw the line below which no unit deserves the title 'hospital'?<br /><br /> And Sken, do you really think that the public are that discerning about the status and capability of different hospitals, or even that they should?    How many public campaigns have been fought to keep small, uneconomic and in your terms unsafe hospitals open, just because they are the local 'hospital'?    The public is far more concerned about proximity and ease of visiting than clinical prowess and resources.     That is a justifiable concern , and one that should be addressed by the civic authorities, while hospital standards should be the responsibility of medical authorities.   Both reporting to the Government, national or local, so as to be answerable to the public in a democracy.<br /><br /> John	John D	2015-11-12 15:51:00	0	0

1528	343	1	"The ramifications of consent to surgery continue to interest me. In recent years I have come across 2 very competent surgeons who have used the phrase ""I will operate if you beg me to"". Fair enough one of these was for indicated but not-in-a-hurry problem but the other was for fairly gross and incapacitating disease (not malignant but likely to have an increasingly unfavourable out come). <br /><br /> I contrast this with a slightly more gung-ho approach of a junior doctor who told someone I was accompanying that there was a cataract in her eye (attending the clinic for other reasons and subjected to regular eye inspection) and she could be put on the list with a view to surgery within 6 weeks and it was essentially a fairly minor procedure. This hit the patient like a bolt from he blue - junior doc could be brilliiant picking up something missed by others in a clinic not geared to cataracts etc....- but clearly a matter for some thought rather than just jumping on to an operating list.<br /><br /> But this idea of ""I will operate if you really cannot cope"" worries me . Clearly patients must not be led to think unrealistically about surgery and its benefits , but begging (does one have to provide a selection of gifts as a supplicant ?) alters the whole doctor / patient relationship and puts us back 40-50 years. It is presumably something to do with self-image - after all if the surgeon operates badly he is still culpable - but what about the patient who feels rejected : could the surgeon be responsible for a bad outcome there?<br /><br /> For me , speaking from a moderately knowledgeable base , the decision is relatively easy - seek the best technician with a reliable anaethetist and know about the expectations and limitations of the procedure involved . But I can see that for others this idea of ""begging"" will be decidedly offputting , although perhaps focusing the mind of those who see surgery will provide an answer which is unlikely."	sken	2015-07-30 08:41:00	0	0
1529	343	1	"In the Pre-op. Assessment Clinic, the medical one not the nurse led screening service, patients are by definition high risk.   In some conditions, especially painful incapacitating arthritis, patients will say, ""I don't care if I die, if there is a chance that this pain will go.""  They are impervious to warnings of risks, however they are described. <br /><br /> And that is their privilege;  it is their pain and thier life and if they will accept the risk, who are we to deny them a chance at more active and pain free life?   The difficulty is, how informed is someone in this situation?  And that our risk prediction is pretty ropey even in the face of apparently lethal morbidity .<br /><br /> John"	John D	2015-07-30 10:31:00	0	0
1530	343	1	"John D - I think we have all come across these folk. Expressed in our current society view that if something is as risky as that then it would not be allowed . No wonder painting the high risks are not taken on board., But patients who really do seem impervious to option appraisals I think are relatively rare and there is an obligation on behalf of the surgeon to be sure that there are clear indications (witness the problems surrounding cosmatic surgery).  I think these are different from attempts to pass outcome measures entirely over to the patient and there is a difference between getting the patient to request surgery and making him/her beg for it.<br /><br />  Nor should Informed consent be used as an excuse for not operating : adverse outcomes should not be overstated. A mortality of 5% should not be portrayed as one of 20%. Some people may not waken after an anaesthetic or have a heart attack during it  , but that should not be portrayed as a routine risk and a reason to refuse to operate. One of my big grouses before retirement was thae way in which surgeons tried to avoid operating as they became older. It seemed to stem from a feeling of not wishing to put head above parapet rather than just idleness. As I think I have commented before , it is depressing as a physician to be looking after patients medically but with indications - sometimes strong indications - for surgery. I was never sure just how far one could go in saying ""Your mother/father needs surgery but they won't go ahead"".** I am of course only talking about surgery within my own specialty where I am reasonably confident about indications.<br /><br /> **I think I usually ducked and probably said something about anaesthetic risks ...."	sken	2015-07-30 11:28:00	0	0

Today was my first day of work in a local access centre. I has been quite fun being a new boy at the age of 65. I am enjoying doing the General Practice without the responsibilities of a Partner. And joy of joys we have 15 minute as apposed to 10 minute appointment. I will only be working part time and will probably take some months off later in the year. The locums in the access centre may form a sort of 'chambers' to sort out 360 review, resuscitation training and various statutory things that must be done by all Doctors. Perhaps this is part of the future of UK General Practice.	Pat Lush	2015-05-05 22:06:00	0	0

1536	345	1	Pat<br /><br /> I'm sure many here will be pleased that you are again enjoying GP work.  The stated reasons seem to be:<br /><br /> 1) Working part-time.<br /><br /> 2) 15 minute appointments<br /><br /> 3) No partnership responsibilities<br /><br /> I'm sure you're right to wonder if 'this' is the future of UK General Practice and you might be able to dissect 'this'.  For example, is the ability to have 15 minute appointments simply because of more doctors and a different population or do more GP practices actually have the ability to challenge the old time limits?<br /><br /> Part-time working has become much more common in General Practice.  Anecdotally, the morale of part-timers seems higher than that of full-timers but do you think there are any adverse consquences for the quality, such as continuity, of a service if the proportion of part-timers gets too high?<br /><br /> Finally, do you think that the independent contractor model of partners with all that extra responsibility is really sacrosanct or is it time to make General Practice a salaried service as for most hospital clinicians?

1552	349	1	"I wish to ask the doc2doc brethren if they can recommend a good site where I could learn Italian by Skype by one to one lessons of course and to be paid for by me. I found one site in Bologna which is 8 hrs behind us but I have not seen any recommdations. As my free time is limited I have found this method time-efficient in the past andsuccessfully took lessons by phone from a French teacher in Lyon for two years.<br /><br /> My criticism of most language teaching is that teachers fail to engage the student in material that interests the student. The modern method is usually light in grammar and syntax so after several years the student is unable to construct a novel sentence in a different tense or person. I like the grammatical approach but want interesting subject matter en route not ""the ink is in the ink well and the exercise book is open"" stuff.<br /><br /> I remember when doing French I came across Pierre Closterman's book, Le Grand Cirque (The Big Show). He was a French air ace in the RAF and all of a sudden French went into my head without needing to be mentally translated. I was reading the Battle of Britain live.<br /><br /> I subsequently joined the French respiratory society which has two journals so this enables me to read the tedium of medicine in an interesting way. It killed two birds with one stone so I then bought textbooks including Harrison's in French.<br /><br /> I find each time I wander into a new tongue, I am in a new world. Babel was not all bad as how dull it would be  if we all thought the same way.<br /><br /> We have an Italian quarter in Brisbane as well as a Greek one but it is just getting to lesson which is awkward. Medicine is a tyrant and the older I get, the more happy and contented I am when doing things other than medicine. When you learn a new tongue suddenly you are coming across people from that tongue.

1558	350	1	The game has changed. At school in the 1950s we were just beginning to move into the world of professional coach etc... but it had not become the life absorbing brutal activity that now exists. What is really appalling is the extent to which some parents push their offspring - encourage is an understatement. I see the body build of some of the adults as almost as freakish as the emaciated distance runners obliged to starve themselves. At least 1 of the present UK team is more than double my bodyweight and therin lies one of the problems of school rugby : players may be very different in size and strength<br /><br /> In the 1950s we used to see rugby league as the rougher sport and rather looked down on soccer. How times change. I was interested in the comments about women's rugby as in some ways I find it easier to relate to this and have lost some interests in watching the largely gladitorial clashes of the men.  <br /><br /> There is a rider to this post - what winter sport would you encourage at school ? Rugby had the advantage that 5 teacher referees could cater at any one time for 150 rugby players but only 110 if soccer. <br /><br /> As a parent I tried not to influence our boys unduly about choices in sport so long as they kept active. I would have had the same approach if they had been girls.	sken	2015-09-23 17:20:00	0	0

1565	351	1	It depends on the quality and availability of the local schools. I went to a state primary school and rage a grammar school but I know eminent physicians who had a state education which in Australia is free. <br /><br /> Snobbery and socially aspiring folk would only go to private schools but in the UK most of you work in state run hospitals. <br /><br /> I have no regular contact with old school mates and tend to avoid alumni events. <br /><br /> I would seek wisdom in this one. Search your heart as to values and motives. <br /><br /> I despise people who send their kids to state schools so they can buy a flash house or car. <br /><br /> There are snobs in state schools too.<br /><br /> A clever child will probably do well anywhere. A vulnerable child might not do well in the pressure of private schools let alone parental pecking orders seen so well when mothers pick up kids or at committee meetings. <br /><br /> There are always the TC'c (too cool) people at private schools where junior is a clone of mother or father. <br /><br /> My experience at private school was not wonderful. But I managed. <br /><br /> Odysseus	Odysseus	2015-09-21 22:45:00	1	0
1566	351	1	It all depends on what is available and your needs. If the local state system is awful and private excellent and you have the means then one may need to go private unless you are so militant that you wish to use your offspring to make a statement.<br /><br /> I went to a private day school in a big city. It was head and shoulders above the state opposition academically and in sport. It also emasculated the other schools by offering scholarships to high performers. The fees were not vast , the social mix pretty broad and the education excellent.  I know that elsewhere State schools can also be brilliant.<br /><br /> We live near a local primary school. Large cars predominate along with many aggressive parents demanding some of those very facilities found at private schools but not prepared to put  money into the system. Remember some children in the UK now go to schools where language mix and the need to teach non-English speakers is a real problem. And in the UK there is also a problem that teaching basic social skills is now seen as a school function not a parental one - children may be in nappies or can't dress themselves etc... (and not just in the first year). A small minority BUT teachers will have to give these pupils preferential time. Our local primary has folk coming from considerable distances and the latest ruling seems to sugest that once one child is taken any subsequent children are guaranteed a place , so for a small village school this could mean a predominance of a small number of families.<br /><br /> There seems also to be an atmosphere of trying to constantly belittle what might be seen as an unfair advantage such as parents having books or being encouraging as regards studies. Private tuition is difficult to stop.<br /><br /> There is the question of your own needs. We had every intention of sending our children to a the local primary but it was then going through a bad patch. What the private sector provided as deciding factor was out of hours activities. This became even more relevant later on , but we were incredibly fortunate in having a major private school not too far away which also took day pupils. State schools have improved enormously in this respect. <br /><br /> Finally you have to think offspring - how hard to push the not-so-bright etc... where they are likely to feel most at home. <br /><br /> Good luck - one of the hardest decisions you will have to make and you may never know whether it was the right one.	sken	2015-09-22 13:29:00	1	0
1567	351	1	"Odysseus, Sken, thanks for the advice. We're finding it tough. We're outside the catchment areas for any of the decent state schools which would mean moving house pretty sharply if we wanted him to have the consistency and security of one junior school, which we do. Even if we moved it wouldn't gaurantee we'd be accepted at one of the ""better"" state schools. Maybe the fact we haven't moved yet is proof  to ourselves that deep down we always knew we would be going private!? One to pose to the other half.<br /><br /> We saw the School Swap programmes recently where state school pupils spent a week at a provate school and private school pupils spent a week at a state school.

1568	351	1	Hi Mikey,<br /><br /> My son is now 17, doing A-levels this year. He has had a fantastic education and is well on track for a top university place if he keeps up his grades as they are now.<br /><br /> We had the same conversation as you when he was small but had a terrific experience with the local primary school, but it was faith based (and we were already attenders) so I have to agree with sken that much depends on what is available. He couldn't have had a better start if we'd paid for it, but you may not be so fortunate. If you invest in moving house, that investment stays with you, whereas the school fees are gone forever.<br /><br /> Once it got to secondary school we made the decision to go private (day school all male - Hampton) even though offered a place at a faith based 'comprehensive' secondary school. The competitive entrance exams mean that he was in with a high performing group from the start. The teaching staff have been excellent as you'd expect but also the extracurricular activites and facilities go way beyond what you can get in a state school, and school days more nearly match our working day than with state schools around here. On teh other hand fees are eye-watering even for a day boy. Once music fees, excursions etc. are added you don't get much change from £20k pa. and that is only likely to go up, so if there is a possibility you may need to send more than one child through the system you'll need more than your NHS salary.<br /><br /> So for us a mixed approach has served well.<br /><br /> Good luck!

A good education but with lousy values and no work ethic,  is not enough to sustain long distance flight. <br /><br /> The other variables are the talent, drive and character  of the fledgling. <br /><br /> Many a great man arose from an imperfect nest while many a great education ended in failure.<br /><br /> Odysseus	Odysseus	2015-09-25 23:46:00	0	0
1570	351	1	I took 11plus and didn't get selected for grammar school. So my parents dug deep and got me into a local public school.     I hope I vindicated their confidence,  as if  cmprehensives had been around I would have gone there, got into the appropriate stream later on And done as well at a lot less cost to them.   <br /><br /> For our children the same choce was necessary, as we have two of the remaining grammars, boys and girls.  The alternatives were faith schools, one CofE and the other Catholic.  The Catholic school might have been interesting, but the CofE was not an option as we felt it impossible to be so hypocritical as to become regular church attenders when we are devout non-believers.    As it was both kids made it to the grammars, so the Q didn't arise.<br /><br /> my own view is that the State should have nothing to do with faith schools.  Any faith, especially if they are so unkind as to make those of other faiths or none unwelcome.   <br /><br /> John	John D	2015-09-27 14:42:00	0	0
1571	351	1	An elephant in the room rarely spoken about but probably underpinning many such decisions is -  as a parent who do you want or not want your kids to mix with?<br /><br /> Most teachers are good and arguably better in the state system as they are dealing with bigger classes and potentially more social issues. They can't rely so much on pushy parents to get kids through exams.<br /><br /> My kids are and always have been at a variety of fantastic state schools. I can't fault our local state high school - but the catchment area is fairly affluent and I'm sure this has a bearing. The large size of the school means the opportunities and facilities are fantastic. The teachers seem smart, funny and enthusiastic and the grades are good.<br /><br /> My siblings and I all went to the local comp. Liked school, did loads of sport and all came out with good grades and have good careers. All my cousins went to a variety of fee paying schools and all came out with worse grades and have worse careers and didn't much like school.<br /><br /> At the end of the day therefore it probably comes down to caring stable home life and ability of kid. Because you are thinking about this and care your kids will do well wherever. Maybe you should go and speak to the teachers/heads at the schools in question then decide.	rayhope	2015-10-07 23:11:00	1	0
1572	352	1	"So the GMC wants doctors to be trained in ""emotional resilience"". Always outwardly unmoved and professionally content whatever is thrown at them by patients and management , so burn out becomes a thing of the past. How far is this feasible ? Can one really train people fresh from school to see and survive unscarred the worst that may be thrown at them without reference to specialty - and without doing harm? Or is this just a way of weeding out more sensitive souls - or developing a non-complaining workforce?<br /><br /> Survival techniques can be invaluable (wish I had learnt about them a bit sooner) but surely must be acquired on the job helped by  supportive mentors rather than just being the odd session given to students .

1576	353	1	Dr S<br /><br /> Others will be better qualified (as women!) to comment on aspects specific to return after maternity leave but there are generic tips that might help after any lengthy leave.  Kirked has indicated some that are always important and I would just add a comment about technical skills as these can rapidly degrade with lack of use.  In running endoscopy training workshops we always advised that even the most expert practictioners avoid tackling very complex cases immediately after return from as little as a few weeks away.<br /><br /> I don't know the full range of technical procedures that you might be asked to undertake as a paediatric trainee but it might be worth listing these and thinking about ways to get back into practice in risk-free circumstances.  One obvious set of skills would be in advanced paediatric life support.  An update might be offered routinely as part of induction but, if not, it might be possible to arrange to attend one separately.  Most well-learned skills return rapidly but it can help to use simulation facilities that are available in your trust or any associated medical schooll.<br /><br /> Supervisors should be aware of this problem with technical skills but could forget that someone returning after a year away might need  initial support with some procedures.  Don't be too proud to ask.<br /><br /> I'm sure we would all be keen to hear about your experiences in due course.

1578	353	1	I'd second the advice about getting cast iron child care in place. You are not in the sort of job where you can just ring in if your child is unwell and unable to go to childminder, creche, etc. I always rather envied those with non-working mothers close by, who could step into the breech if necessary, but medical careers often tend to take one away from close family.<br /><br /> Different people have different solutions - mine was to employ a nanny from 8am till my husband's more fixed end of working day. We were lucky to find a gem. She mucked in unasked with ironing and light housework as well as childcare, and put on lunch for me and hubby as well when we were able to pop home (we lived 5 mins or so from the hospital). However, this peace of mind took a large slice of my salary till my daughter started school and my husband coincidentally got made redundant and decide to work from home, self-employed, at about the same time. Whatever you choose, the main thing is to have back up in a crisis; because it's a case of when, not if, one will arise.	Ginny May	2015-08-29 00:36:00	0	0

1581	354	1	Isn't there only one correct answer to this question as worded?  None of those contributing to the thread were able to cite any evidence of a general beneficial effect of having children, probably because no such study has ever or will ever be done. (that's a challenge for someone to find one)  In the absence of evidence, the correct answer has to be 'don't know' but it's highly likely the answer would be 'no' if it were ever tested.<br /><br /> Sure, anyone is entitled to their view that having children made them a better doctor but that's entirely personal and subjective.  Even so, it might need corroboration from patients or colleagues before getting too cocky.<br /><br /> We're moderately sure about some things that make people better doctors but this isn't one of them.  <br /><br /> If this is all just a bit of fun we ought to ask the question, does being a doctor make you a better parent, a worse parent or no different?

1597	355	1	Thank all of you for the nice answers .  What JohnD show to us is very interesting but the athletes who were examined were from all over the sports .  In this group of research surely most of the athletes were training in sports that is ''considered '' that enhance the tall stature , like  running , swimming, basketball , volleyball etc  . It didnt  separated athletes in groups of sports that were performing. All the sports were examined together .  And what Happy said is correct ( maybe nutrition has one of the most important roles )  .  The weight lifting that is done  today  is mostly with the use of machineries in the '' gym'' . This machineries don't let the weight to press the spine .  And so it has not a lot of chances to influence the stature of the young athlete .  And what Skysteve said is correct . Kick boxing is mostly an aerobic sport .  But Kick boxers , as and the classical boxers ,  are using mostly the shoulders to give the punch . they are more '' strategical '' but  less 'technical''  all though maybe they are very efficient .  The force from the hand until the ground has a lot of articulations where it can be lost  ( elbow , shoulder , knee , ankle )  and so and the force that presses the spine is less.  In traditional martial arts those losses of energy at the articulations are getting minimised . They are working hard on it until they do it . So the energy as it doesn't get lost on the different articulations will be maximum and for the spine.  (i  don't know if a helped you understand but i did my best try.. )   So if a kid will starts traditional martial arts at the age of 14 , until reaches to learn the correct technic needs about 4-5 years  . So until then it is already 18-19 years old and has no big influence on the stature . But what happens with the kids that are starting at the age of 10 or less?    The truth is that we have not a lot of them as very few are so diligent .  Almost all of them who i have met have a short stature . And this made me to rise the question .   For you Sadian what can i say ?..  Only that the best perfumes are in the small bottles.	ikaros	2013-02-22 11:01:00	0	0
1598	355	1	"ikaros, All good arguments, but all pure conjecture.   If this is your interest, get going and start to collect some data!   But we all lose height as we age: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2807265. I think through degeneration of intervertebral discs and exacerbated when we as professionals tend to have our children at an older age.  So we should not be surprised, even given the regression to the mean that prevents the average child being taller or shorter than their parents.So, be warned.   I think most men, as their sons reach full adulthood and height, are surprised to find that somehow, the son is taller than the father.    A colleague of mine came in one day looking, shall we say, thoughtful.  He had had such an argument with his son over breakfast that he had stood up and ordered him out of the room.  The son stood up too.  ""And do you know - he's taller than me!""John"	John D	2013-02-22 14:02:00	0	0

1606	357	1	Gemma - I guess there are different cultures between primary and secondary care. I work as a GP in a partnership and had no problem 9 years ago getting a lot of time off to accompany my late wife to chemotherapy and radiotherapy sessions. They understood the reasons and also the temporary nature of the situation. I wasn't asked to pay the time back or fund locums. In return I have done the same for colleagues who need time off. JohnD raises the issue of maternity leave and there is a lot of bias out there against it. But really it's up to the system organisers to ensure the system has adequate slack to cope with what is a statutory right.Your circumstances are a bit different because you are not yet pregnant. But to my eye what is happeneing is that you are going through a series of medical assesments or investigations or procedures and in that respect you are no different to anyone else with any other medical condition requiring such intervention. You are entitled to ask and receive time off to attend your hospital appointments and you should insist on it. Managers get paid to manage and they should just get on with it. Good luck!

1607	357	1	Going through IVF is emotionally draining and you will need to be resilient as I suspect people you work with may not be universally understanding. Heed skysteve's advice and remember that you have a right to medical treatment which is what this is.

1609	357	1	I have an appointment for a 'Patient Information Evening' soon, where we'll find out about the IVF process and hopefully get started along the road. However, (apart from injections!) the thing I'm most anxious about already, is the possibility of having to take time off work for treatment/procedures etc.  I started a new job last week, so it's actually terrible timing!! However, after TTC for 2.5yrs before getting to this stage, we don't want to put IVF on hold.  I haven't told my new employer about IVF/TTC and I don't intend to unless I really have to, because I don't want people thinking that I'm not committed to the job, or treating me as if I'm not worth investing in because they presume I'm going to be going off on maternity leave soon. (I know very little about IVF at this stage, but I am aware that the success-rate is likely to be only 1 in 3 anyway, so I'm not building my hopes up, and I don't want other people presuming that IVF will definitely result in a pregnancy.	sofat	2015-06-19 13:57:00	0	0

1611	357	1	As mentioned above it is worth discussing this with your employer and the BMA but :<br /><br />  <br /><br /> The Equality Act (2010) Code of Practice states that treating a woman unfavourably because she is undergoing IVF or other fertility treatment would not count as pregnancy and maternity discrimination. This is because a woman is not deemed pregnant until the fertilised ova have been implanted in the uterus.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> However,  such unfavourable treatment could amount to sex discrimination. Although there is no statutory entitlement to time off for IVF or other fertility treatment, in responding to requests for time off from a member of staff undergoing IVF, an employer must not treat them less favourably than they treat, or would treat, a member of staff of the opposite gender in a similar situation, as this could amount to sex discrimination. After a fertilised embryo has been implanted, a woman is legally pregnant and from that point is protected from unfavourable treatment because of her pregnancy, including pregnancy related sickness. She would also be entitled to time off for antenatal care.<br /><br />  <br /><br /> (Go to mums.net etc to see discussions about this topic plus lots of others thru a google search)<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Kirked	kirked	2015-06-19 16:38:00	0	0

The blog was published on The Doctor Blog http://www.thedoctorblog.com/motherhood-and-medicine/ and was also hosted on Kevin MD Blog http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/01/mother-physician.html Reading this quite intriguing post, I wonder whether the same principles apply to other medical/surgical fields or not.

Subsequently it has made   medical practice much more meaningful."	rcdeacon	2014-01-25 03:40:00	0	0

1619	359	1	"As an expectant mother for the first time I was interested to read today on the BBC news website about the rise of ""baby tech"" and the paranoid parents<br /><br /> On the simplest level one could consider a baby monitor (listening device), but for many years it has been possible for parents to buy items such as apnoea monitors for home use to ""put their minds at rest"" that their children are ok while they are not in the room, knowing that should the child stop breathing an alarm will sound. In my experience as a paediatrician parents then get very jumpy when the machines trigger false alarms leading to lengthy hospital consultations for reassurance. My brother in law lost several nights of sleep when their toddler learnt to climb in and out of bed and so the alarm sounded, only for the child to back in bed by the time parents ran into the room.<br /><br /> For adults interested in their own health there are a wealth of apps and devices available. I confess my phone has apps for me to track my weight, to advise me on my pregnancy, to monitor my sleep quality and a lazy app which uses the phone's camera to take my pulse using the same principles of pulseoximetry. I have so far avoided buying of physical devices such as pedometers or heart rate monitors which I've seen many of my friends and colleagues using.<br /><br /> For adult patients we now encourage the use of certain apps and paired devices. Many diabetics have blood sugar minitors which use tech to advise on insulin boluses and can the bluetooth all the data back to the consultant's computer in the clinic setting. Similar concepts are being used to start monitoring asthma and other chronic conditions.<br /><br /> But devices and apps available for babies now include a sock to measure heart rate, sats and movements and feed this back to the parent's mobile phone, a device to monitor how fast the child bottle feeds and even a device which claims to diagnose your child's cry and tell you the cause (happy, hungry, pain etc).<br /><br /> I cant help but feel that although the concepts behind some of these devices will be sound, the motives behind the inventors and those who sell and promote them will be more based around profittering from parents who are insecure / paranoid or simply well meaning and too tech dependent.<br /><br /> Are companies wrong to cash in on parents / patient's insecurities? Or is this a logical progression of teach improving our day-to-day lives?"	DrS	2014-06-07 20:17:00	0	0
1620	359	1	It would be far more wrong if doctors or other apparently learned people promoted such devices.  <br /><br /> My daughter (the doctor) has a VIDEO baby alarm, that links both sound and vision wirelessly to her smartphone, so that any disturbance heard from baby can be confirmed and diagnosed by sight as well.    Although she would never use it in that way, she and dad could see and hear baby from miles away, and sing a lullaby as well!  Just bragging.<br /><br /> John	John D	2014-06-07 23:57:00	0	0

1625	361	1	I had a vaginal delivery for my first and am hoping for the same again later this year. Saying that though, i did stress to my midwife & obgyn that my end goal was healthy bub/healthy mum no matter how I got there, therefore at first sign of complications i wanted them to prep for a c-section. (Having seen a number of last minute, emergency c-sections in my time, the last thing i wanted was a crazy, panicked rush because we'd pushed our luck & held out too long). The large majority of my medic mum friends have opted for vaginal also, with those that wound up with an emergency c-section now considering v-bac for bub number two.	bkw1976	2013-07-27 12:38:00	0	0
1626	361	1	Sabrina – good luck and this may interest you! My daughter had a C section for a breech 5 years ago, and this time round wanted a vaginal delivery. She was told she had to have full monitoring in the local centre of excellence. However the baby had other ideas. Last Friday, 2 weeks early, she went into labour in the early evening and at 8pm her waters broke. The hospital said take a paracetamol and see how things went. However the contractions continued and at about 10.30 found herself pushing. Her husband phoned the hospital and they said to come in straightaway. However she was crowning and they didn’t have a car! When the people at the hospital realised she was serious they said call 999. The paramedics came just in time to supervise delivery by husband! All was well, baby fine. My daughter was delighted –she wanted a home birth all along. The labour took 2 hours.	Scheherazade	2013-07-28 17:29:00	0	0

1629	363	1	It's a perennial question, but I just wanted to get a sense of when I should expect that night shifts (and I guess long days) are no longer possible in pregnancy. I know the official line is that you discuss it with occ health and it all depends on your own pregnancy and health, but I don't have a feeling for whether a lot of people continue to work nights right up until they go on mat leave, or whether its more realistic to expect to have difficulties after eg 30 weeks... Personal experiences?	paed_st	2012-08-25 17:27:00	0	0
1630	363	1	In Response to working nights during late pregnancy:You are absolutely right that it varies; both between women, and also for each pregnancy a woman has. When I was researching my book, I heard the whole spectrum of stories. A paediatric reg who was pregnant with twins but did nights right up to the end of her pregnancy, and other women who were too unwell to do long days in the first trimester. Remember that your Trust has a responsibility to help you, but that doesn't take away the stress for you. At every other time in your life you've waited until the 11th hour to get your rota; when you're pregnant someone seems to do the rota months in advance and leave you in a panic that you won't cope in the future. It's hard to know how you will feel at the end of pregnancy, and it's unreasonable for your department to expect you to know; but if in doubt then play on the side of caution and assume that you may be finding things harder in the last trimester. Then if you feel well, things can probably be changed to accomodate you. Remember that most of us push ourselves too hard and feel guilty, and if you do, then you're more likely to have to go off unexpectedly, which is harder for your team to cope with. Good luck!

1631	363	1	As I change jobs half way through my pregnancy, I have no idea how I'll cope with my new job, but I need to sort things out with Occ Health before I start, as I need to have decided when to go off on maternity leave and if I can take annual leave before hand before I start.  (If I have to swap out of on calls in order to take annual leave, I won't be able to do it, as i'm only just coping with the normal amount of on calls in my present job, let alone doubling up on them).All the 'official' advice I've received is really unhelpful, as everyone says 'it depends on your pregnancy and your job'.  But I have NO idea what is reasonable, and I really don't want to take advantage of the system, but on the other hand i know I have to look after myself and my baby. Would it be unreasonable to ask to stop doing nights at about 30 weeks???  I'm doing 24hour shifts in this job, and at 21 weeks, they leave me throwing up and incapacitated for two days afterwards.  My next job does 12 hour night shifts, which I assume will be easier than 24 hours, so I'm hoping I'll be able to do a few once I start.  I'll be 26 weeks when I change over.It would be really helpful, just to get a feeling for when people have stopped doing them, just to give my a ball park figure.  I know it won't necessarily be the same for me, but as a medic, I'm used to weighing up evidence and deciding whether it's applicable to my patients!!!

1637	365	1	What practices need locums?  Often small ones (there are loads of these left in London), ones advertising for long term posts (often takes longer than they think to get someone into the permanent post so they need short term locums in the meantime), Ones whose principals do a lot of non-clinical work (eg on CCG boards) - so to some extent you can direct your marketing.  Make sure the practice managers know who you are and encourage feedback of patients to the practice if they like you - I have got most work from recommendations from other practices.Do agency work further from home so you don't get contractually stuck not being able to work freelance near home because you've worked their through an agency before.But basically you need a really good CV and to send out loads and follow them up because practices receive loads and you need to stand out.  What's your USP?  And be able to say yes to the first booking or they may not ask you again!

1641	365	1	At my practice we have set up a WhatsApp group for locum GPs in the area. When we require cover we msg the group and this has helped to fill quite a few sessions when required. Would other locum GPs/partners be interested in this system if it were set up for their own area? It would ideally include locum GPs and several local practices. I think WhatsApp is much quicker than emailing/phoning - plus there is a saving in reducing the use of locum agencies. What are your thoughts?	GP2009	2016-04-30 00:54:00	0	0
1642	366	1	Just some thoughts on EBM/Guidelines and Law.<br /><br />Evidence is information. It supports or undermines a proposition, whether a hypothesis in science, a diagnosis in medicine, or a fact or point in question in a legal investigation. In medicine, physicians marshal evidence to make decisions on how to best prevent, diagnose, and treat disease, and improve health.  The hierarchy of evidence  includes statistical epidemiological evidence, case reports, case series, their own clinical experience and judgment and the opinions of others. Medicine, like law, has various means for testing and assessing evidence, which include reproducibility and predictability in addition to statistical significance. However, medicine can rely on a much greater degree of certainty with evidence than law. Reasonable doubt or the civil standard (i.e. more likely than not) does not reach anywhere near as high as medical certainty. No court in the United Kingdom would want to apply EBM to their judicial processes. Each legal case is unique, related to past individual stories through the interpretation and application of precedents, whereas EBM not only abolishes individual variation between clinicians, it also abolishes the individual stories that are essential to the adversarial process (although the adversarial process is not necessarily the best way to seek the truth). EBM, of course, relies on the validity of individual data being processed in meta-analyses; however, the validity of an individual plaintiff’s claim is exactly what the courts are testing, and no a priori assumption can be made. The expert, therefore, can find himself in the unwelcome position of simultaneously accepting and doubting the validity of the medical evidence to which he must speak.<br /><br />Prior to EBM, courts often sought medical expertise in the form of expert witnesses for four key questions in a medical negligence case: the applicable standard of care or what the Doctor ought to have done, causation or the connection between the wrongful conduct and the harm to the patient, assessment of damages or how much money is needed to adequately compensate the patient’s injuries, and medical prognosis. Such testimony has depended on the expert’s subjective analysis, and one lawsuit often may involve several experts who disagree and present opposing testimony on each side. EBM presents the possibility of empirical, objective guidance that can be used in addition to the information given by expert witnesses.<br /><br />It is important to make clear that clinical guidelines are not legally binding and are designed to inform clinical practice rather than dictate it.  NICE cautions: ‘Any health professional who is considering departing from NICE guidance may wish to discuss the issue fully with the patient and/or their guardian or carers and should keep a record of his/her reasons for taking such a decision in the patient's notes’.  Defending any claim of negligence related to a departure from guidelines will rest on the quality of the consultations and records and will be dependent on a responsible independent expert’s support of the chosen course of action<br /><br />Are guidelines promoting cookbook medicine? How should courts use guidelines? Do they set the standard of care which informs the court? Might Doctors be fearful to depart from guidelines? What about legal liability for those who draft guidelines? Should they be liable if it transpires the guidelines have flaws?<br /><br />kirked	kirked	2015-10-17 19:48:00	1	0

Incidentally in a year and a bit's time I will leave General Practice as a Partner at the age of 65. I may do some  work as a locum, for a year or two , probably only in this Practice rather than elsewhere. It will be interesting to see how working as a locum differs from being a Partner.

1655	371	1	I'm often asked why I've chosen to be a Career GP Locum.  Well I fell into it, having moved to London, I found myself locuming and loved the flexibility.  Yes it was hard at first but I've discovered so many advantages that I don't think I could ever go back to a permanent job.  Especially now that I have a small child, the flexibility helps me juggle my career mum status.  Here are my top 5 reasons why I'm a career locum:1: Flexibility - already mentioned twice.  I usually book around 4 weeks in advance so can often book courses and leave at short notice2: Career development - as a locum I have a more flexible working week so can develop my career without compromising practice commitments. I am a GP Appraiser and F2 clinical supervisor.  I'm also getting involved in commissioning.3: Continuity - I have developed relationships with a small number of practices that I have worked with for years.  I attend practice meetings, get involved in audits and teaching, and provide continuity of care for my patients4: Diversity - I work in practices and Urgent Care Centres/Walk in Centres that cover a diverse population which keeps my work interesting and keeps my finger on the pulse of developments across our sector5: Being self employed - odd thing to say but I love working for myself and being part of a team of great locums who provide great care for patients.  Do you enjoy locuming?  What are your top 5 reasons for locuming?

1656	371	1	They're great reasons, Zana.Here are mine1. I used to locum when my kids were small, but now that my mum is old and infirm the flexibiity is a big help.2. Locum work also enables me to pursue portfolio interests - teaching and writing.3. There are tax advantages4. You can often escape much of the admin burden.5. Yep, being self-employed is great!

1657	371	1	I liked your top 5, here are mine...1- flexibility, no problems arranging my holidays in advance and ring fencing, no need to agree / compromise with colleagues2- its closer to what i trained to be - ie helping patients, none of the non patient workload that besets partners / salaried colleagues3- self employed, yes its great, develops personal responsibility and tax advantages4- opportunities to explore other roles, i'm writing a book and sit on an 'out of hours' provider board, and am enjoying developing a local physio website resource5-variety,  its really interesting to see the inside of different practices, and the different ways practices get the same stuff done	drsimonwade	2012-11-18 20:16:00	0	0
1658	371	1	My top reason to be gp locum is to be on the top of the pile and to work in different environments. I found E-Locum 24 as it remain in touch with recruiters regularly, inform them about your availability and also charge very less as compared to other locum agencies.	lillymarkand	2014-02-11 11:20:00	0	0
1659	371	1	I also got my locum job through locum agency and my top reason to be locum are;<br /><br /> Ability to work in different practices<br /> More clinical and very less paperwork<br /> To have self employed assistance<br /> Can mix with distinctive interest<br /> Good introduction into general practice.	andrewsmith	2014-02-28 06:24:00	0	0

As a Locum and a GP Appraiser, one of the things that I am reassuring many Locums about is the requirements of revalidation.  Getting involved in a small aspect of practice quality improvement, for example a QUIPP audit where you could do a few reviews and attend a meeting, plus reflections can demonstrate engagement and understanding of audit, its function and how it can improve practice.  I agree that practices are often very welcoming of locums who want to get involved, attend the occasional or regular clinical meeting, contribute significant events or share their learning with the group.  You can do your own case reviews of patients by keeping lists of EMIS numbers and reviewing cases with reflections in your own time.  Most GPs get some study leave, but as a locum you should factor this into your workload.  I account for 6 weeks leave a year which includes 1 week study.  In some areas locums make up almost half the workforce, so you are not alone - have you thought about joining forces and working together?

1668	372	1	Fit/sick notes all look the same without any identifiable code. Is it a probity issue to carry 3 or 4 blank notes in your locum bag from a different practice to use if you can't find any during a shift elsewhere?	benji	2012-07-11 21:59:00	0	0
1669	372	1	II don't think it should be a probity issue - particularly if they're blank. However, I make a point of NOT bring fit notes on visits - I feel one is much better able to make the assessment with the patient attending surgery. If they really can't attend surgery, and it really can't wait, one can fill in the form back at surgery.Less to carry!	Richard F	2012-07-12 14:20:00	0	0

1674	373	1	Hi, i work at a Locum Agency as their Commercial Manager.What type of Locum work are you doing?Most walk in centres pay £70.00 per hour but offer longer hours.  If you are just working in a normal NHS Surgery covering 2.5 to 3 hours of surgery AM or PM then £85.00 per hour is probably our average rate.If you are working a full day as a GP replacment (On call, Visits, paperwork etc) then anywhere from £550.00 to £650.00 per day.It does always depend on the what the surgery are willing to pay.In my experience, there isn't much difference between North, South and London pay for Locums.remember, if you don't ask, you don't get!

1675	374	1	I recently attended a sessional GP's Seminar in Essex and in one of the discussions it was clear that returning to work after Maternity is not easy.A few GP's said that they felt they couldn't remember the basics and they were not as confident with the work load after returning to the post.I asked if any of those GP's had considered working as a Locum before returning to a full time post?  My reasoning is that if you can find somewhere without all of the expectation, then you may relax a little more.  Just find somewhere that you can work 2.5 hours for an AM or PM, work your way back into it gently and then when you are ready.There are lots of Sessional GP support groups you can speak to.  The Lead of the Essex LMC said that he would happily take a call from anyone in a position where they felt they just needed advice without being judged!

I reckon I'm about 30 minutes behind usually.	sadian	2012-11-18 17:23:00	0	0
1684	376	1	I find the receptionists generally get patients to rebook unless they have a reasonable sounding reason for being late, or an acute sounding problem. Certainly harder to say no if a reasonable reason /urgent sounding problem is conveyed by the receptionist.One way of mitigating the disruption of late patients is to see the next one as soon as they arrive so you are not twiddling your thumbs, often late patients dont mind waiting until the end, if necessary,  as long as they are seen.	drsimonwade	2012-11-18 19:13:00	0	0
