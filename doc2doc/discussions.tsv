0	0	1	Dear members  I am posting to let you know about upcoming plans for doc2doc and plans to develop new channels for discussion and debate across all BMJ products.  doc2docs launch eight years ago pre-dated the rise of Twitter, Facebook, and other social media channels for debating the latest clinical developments. However, over time BMJ has seen more of its readers and customers use these platforms for this purpose.  Because of this continuing trend BMJ has decided to close doc2doc. This was a very difficult decision to make because doc2doc has so many loyal, articulate members. Many at BMJ have greatly appreciated its value as a platform to establish what clinicians worldwide think about particular topics and ideas.  doc2docs success as an online community is due, in no small part, to your hard work and we want to take this opportunity to thank you for all your contributions over the years.  BMJs focus over the coming months is to consider what a successor to doc2doc might look like. Current thinking is perhaps the launch of a BMJ branded community platform that straddles all BMJ products rather than a standalone site? Please let us know your thoughts on this.  In the meantime we hope to continue reading your views elsewhere on BMJ webpages. for example, in the form of:  Rapid responses to articles on thebmj.com  Comments on blogs from thebmj.com  Comments on BMJ Talk Medicine podcasts uploaded on SoundCloud   Comments on BMJ videos posted on YouTube.  Later this year we hope to revamp BMJ blogs. Plans are at an early stage, but we are confident that this new resource will appeal to doc2docs eloquent following. We will keep you posted.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.  Best wishes  Sabreena-kj696ieqatf81ai3mt1	Sabreena	8/6/2016 3:26 PM	0	0
1	0	1	Surely this is a mispost?      Close Doc to Doc?  With all the volumes of educational posts, from so many medical experts, and now the BMJ is going to close a truly useful tool?  This is pure lunacy.   AS with all things good, if it works, someone decides to stop it...      DuaneF-wnhv3k1bn6	DuaneF	9/6/2016 3:56 PM	0	0
2	0	1	Dear Sabreena Malik and David Payne:  Before putting here what I think, suggestions, opinions, etc........I would really like seeing sken, John D, Pat Lush, Kirked, skysteeve, DundeeChest, and other colleagues who live in the UK, so should have perhaps a better idea than I could have about this relationship of doc2doc with the BMJ.  Of course, anyone opinion and thoughts matter.  For now, it does not seem a good idea closing doc2doc, but Ill keep an open mind to this BMJ decision.  All Best,  Joey-8y	Joey Rio	10/6/2016 3:56 AM	0	0
3	0	1	Things change,   i would like to thank all the founding members and the current membership of doc to doc. When it started I was still working full time. Now I am retired and only working in a very part time capacity. I feel i have gained from doc to doc and I very much prefer the BMA to the RCGPs. i am in Worcester at the moment having been at a BMA social event at Worcester pottery museum last night.   I will consider using any form that evolves from Doc to Doc.   The first part of retirement has not been to bad, I am off on my motorcycle to travel to Portugal on Saturday!   My wife will fly and I hope to join her in Portugal in a few days.-gmryhv	PatLush	10/6/2016 6:48 AM	0	0
4	0	1	The niche filled by doc2doc is not covered as well by some of the alternatives but I can see it has had an adequate trial run (8 years....). The 2 areas where one had hoped to see more development was in encouraging its potential as an international discussion group for those in medical fields and at various stages of training. It has also been pro-active in developing ideas whereas some of the alternatives (eg BMA rapid responses) are essentially reactive and not as suitable for bouncing ideas into an arena for discussion. The alternative which seems to function best is doctors.net but it does not - and essentially cannot - have the international scope of doc2doc nor the inclusion of loosely related care professionals and can be very diverse. Personally I have never bothered with Twitter or Facebook so I can't really comment on those. I suspect I am just showing one of my prejudices.   My impression has been that users (not necessarily contributors) of doc2doc have included a wide range of folk interested in the broader aspects of medical care and with a wide range of expertise. Perhaps somewhere in the files of the BMJ a list should be kept of contact addresses should we e ever which to seek an opinion....-ky6au	sken	10/6/2016 10:18 AM	0	0
5	0	1	I was not a founder member of doc2doc but have made some contributions periodically over the last four years. Speaking for myself - as a non medic - it has been thoroughly enjoyable to interact with medical professionals of all specialities from different countries and of various levels of seniority.   My disappointment though is that closing doc2doc seems to have been made unilaterally by the BMJ organisation (which they are perfectly entitled to do) without soliciting from members suggestions how doc2doc might survive. It is probably the case that it would have been closed anyway but it might have been possible for it to continue in another incarnation (not rapid responses etc). I cannot believe it requires huge sums of money or massive input by a large team to keep it moving along, so presumably it is that it no longer 'fits' with whatever the broader plan for BMJ might be. Is there sufficient interest and support to keep it going? Is there the will at BMJ to keep it going?   About six weeks ago I like many others were told the site was to close and asked to say nothing. I felt very uncomfortable with that. It didn't seem right that folk might start new threads or join the site when the curtain was to fall imminently. Nevertheless the decision seems irrevocable and I shall miss our conversations on such a wide range of topics. It cannot be denied however that posting activity has ebbed and flowed and more lately has dwindled.   Just looking back at the range of topics discussed from medical news to more complex medical conditions, research, Medicolegal case reports etc illustrates the breadth of knowledge and experience that could be available to those with a query and presumably will remain available through internet caches for some time to come.   I would be interested to know the opinions on closing from our respected members abroad - Joey Rio et al. Perhaps those of us that wish to do so can keep an informal network together.   It would be absolutely remiss not to thank John D for his incredible committment to doc2doc as contributor and moderator for several years. He has always been active starting and contributing to discussions whilst having to constantly bat away advertisements, patients' requests for advice and miscellaneous inappropriate posts. Much appreciated John.   kirked-5d5d24	kirked	10/6/2016 11:56 AM	0	0

10	1	1	"Should three-phase trials be abandoned? Andrew V Metcalfe, an associate professor in statistics at the University of Adelaide, asks this in response to the death of a manlast month during a drug trial in France.  BBC news health editor James Gallagher described the death in his report as ""the bitter price of the new medicines we take for granted."" He concludes: ""Testing such experimental drugs, at the cutting edge of science, can never be completely risk-free.""  Professor Metcalfe, responding to a paper on thebmj.com, argues that biotrial phase I trial of an experimental drug has shown that while the risk may be small the consequences can be tragic.  Using biometric information such as DNA profiles would shift the emphasis from the estimation of the average effects of a new treatment to the prediction of its effects on specific patients, he concludes.-2ywt0"	David Payne	22/2/2016 1:56 PM	1	0

13	1	1	The answer is yes, it is about time to abandon phase 3 clinical trials.   It is perhaps also a good time to abandon pharmaceutical marketing campaigns disguised as phase 4 clinical trials.   Randomized clinical trials are the best source of high quality evidence according to the foundations of evidence based medicine (EBM). However, the pyramid of EBM is not supported by evidence (i.e., data) and opinion polls are not evidence anyway (the earth was the center of the universe 500 years ago).

15	3	1	NHS England have produced a 56 page article 'General Practice Forward View'. There is comment on this by Dr Margaret McCartney in the BMJ of 30th April 2016. She makes several salient points.   Spending money on non-evidence based interventions leads to multiple harms: it wastes time and energy and disrupts the NHS.   30 m on acceleration towards a paper free environment, where is he evidence of benefit ?   45 on increasing online consultations, where is the evidence of benefit ?   ... and two elephant sided holes , lack of cost effectiveness of Care Quality Commission.   and the urgent need to stop doing things that don't work, Health and Social Care Act, unnecessary and un proven screening and unnecessary targets.   I only do a few out of hours sessions now. I do worry about General Practice. The almost universal reason that I see patients in OOH is that they could not get a timely appointment with their GP. GP are so busy chasing targets that there is little time left to see ill patients. Prevention may be better than cure .

20	4	1	Thank you to everyone who posted.  The answer is:Left upper lobe collapse probably as a result of hilar bronchogenic carcinoma.  The plain film chest radiograph shows the characteristic radiological features of left upper lobe collapse (fig 2): a mediastinal shift to the left side with volume loss in the left hemithorax. Note the hilar and left diaphragmatic elevation associated with a veil-like increased density of the left upper lobe sparing the lingula (the left heart border is clearly seen suggesting that the lingula is aerated). The most likely diagnosis in an adult with a collapsed upper lobe is that of a central obstructing tumour, and this was confirmed in this patient.       Fig 2Plain film chest radiograph showing veil-like opacity in the left upper zone. Note the deviation of the left hilum and the loss of clarity of the hilar outline secondary to the adjacent collapse (black arrows)  You can see more Education articles fromThe BMJhere-bfz66aja5wh034023	BMJ Education	6/4/2016 3:42 PM	0	0
21	5	1	"Is allowing a patient to choose the ethnicity of his of her attending doctor institutional racism? Nadeem Moghal asked this in a personal view published by The BMJ more than two years ago, but the debate continues in recent responses to the article.      To cut a long story short, Moghal's employer complied with a family's refusal to have care to their child delivered by black or other minority ethnic doctor, but staff successfully challenged the decision when it came to light.      The hospital's unwitting thoughtlessness, argues the author, falls foul of recommendation's made in The Macpherson Report into the Metropolitan Police's murdery inquiry following the death of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in the 1990s.     One response to Moghal's article recalls how in 1963, a nurse of Indian origin was told by three people in A&E that ""they preferred to be treated by one of their own.""      A second doctor asks for advice after hearing that a nursing home patient had told an Asian nurse only to send white doctors and nurses to deliver care .      Two years on, and medical student Mohammed Sajid reignites the debate in a response from the Czech Republic, reporting hostility towards Muslim staff and students     Jog Anand replies thus, expanding the debate into choosing the gender of a clinician:      1. Assuming the patient is a minor and critically ill, I for one would agree to the guardian's choice - rather than see the child die.   2.Regardless of religion, if a woman patient requests treatment by a woman doctor ( emergency or "" cold"" case), again I would agree to the request.      Jog's arguments are persuasive, but perhaps not when you consider the conclusion to Moghal's 2014 article:      ""I will always believe that what had gone on was a worthy subject for internal whistleblowing. The key lesson is that immediately confronting and standing up to racists rather than enabling them must be the first step to building equitable organisations. Organisations and especially their leaders must learn; Stephen Lawrence has much to teach us all.""

22	5	1	Thank you for raising this again, David.     I am amazed that any Trust, surgery or Clinic would make such an undertaking.  For wholly practical reasons, and ignoring the ethical and moral arguments, how can they be sure that a doctor or nurse of the precise background demanded by the patient, and of appropriate training and experience will be available?   And the same applies on gender.   In most circumstances, a chaperone of the appropriate sex may be easier for a hard-pressed department to provide than superimposing that requirement on top of the necessary training and skills.

23	5	1	Thanks John - yes, I too worry about the logistics here, leaving aside all the moral and ethical issues.

24	5	1	For a whole variety of reasons , I can envisage circumstances where I would decline to be treated by a doctor wearing a facial veil all the time. These reasons are not primarily sexist or religious (I would have the same feeling about a doctor wearing a Balaclava and other items of highly inappropriate dress hampering recognition and facial expression. Surgical masks are not the same as veils and most times I have been through theatres there have been times when I have met the individuals concerned without them.	sken	3/4/2016 1:54 PM	0	0

35	7	1	"The BMJ'sjournal watch blogger Richard Lehman suggests ditching the term hospice on the grounds that ""it carries an unmistakable whiff of medieval incense and the Crusades.""  In the UK, he argues in his latest blog, many of them bear the names of Christian saints, addding: ""No wonder you hardly ever see a Muslim patient in a hospice; and I know many atheists who view them with suspicion.""  I'm a big fan of hospices. My sister works in one and our late mother attended it in the months before her death, reluctantly at first as she wasn't sure what it would entail. The team there was an incredible source of support to her and to her children, but like Richard I don't like the word. It sounds so antiquated somehow.  The problem is, I can't think of another name.-md"	David Payne	24/2/2016 10:15 AM	1	0
36	7	1	"David - Many thanks. An interesting point - should we ditch "" hospital"" as well at the same time? I think the connotations of ""hospice"" are appropriate and reflects their development and what they are. Changing the name would certainly be fashoinable - Society seems completely out of touch with the idea of calling a spade a spade .   The problem for hospices is in large part their roots are based in religion . This might not matter in the UK as religion is as much a cultural attitude rather than a system of belief. To some extent this is in line with CoE primary schools. It may be difficult for those with a strong other faith to grasp and understand this. There is also the problem that they are not part of the NHS in the same way as are hospitals - funding from the public is crucial and it may be in part that the idea of ""hospice"" encourages charitable donations , apart from the feel good factor and the I-might-need-it-one-day prompts. Failure to provide hospice facilities is a reflection to some extent on the local community - not just a lack of community spirit but also the large amounts of money involved are beyond the resources of many poor areas.   As regards what they provide I think I have mixed feelings but as they gradually move to a broader attitude towards care my misgivings become less.   The Muslim question I think is complex. We might need a separate system - think Red Cross and Green Crescent . Perhaps a wing attached to ordinary hospices. The care needed may well be different particularly in grasping differences in attitudes towards death and active non-palliative treatment.-to6b62"	sken	24/2/2016 1:19 PM	0	0
37	7	1	"The modern use of the word hospice is just another example of the wonderful plasticity and adaptability of the English language.  As well as being incredibly welcoming of words from other langauges, and making up new ones, about a thousand a year according to the OED, it re-uses old ones.  Examples? Gay, nice (was ""exact""), guy (name>effigy>generic male term>generic people term, with sidetracks to mockery), car (car/t), bit (small fragment>digital atom)(see also tweet, tag, stream, friend), troll(mythical ogre>digital ogre), spam (meat of unknown origin>messages of unkonown origin. Hmmmm maybe not so re-used!)   To indict ""hospice"" with medievalism and incense is a petty criticism - as David says, if you want a different one think of of something better.  The tendency of Hospices to have saintly names is down to the honourable tradition of selfless giving associated with religion of all forms, that is about the only factor that excuses religion for all its other excesses.  Other societies, Moslem, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, have similar traditions of giving - do thye have hospices and what are they called?  English might be glad to aborb those words too!

38	7	1	I have to disagree with Richard Lehman on this one (I think his musings on 'lust and rage' in the same blog are much better)   The NHS has rightly concentrated attention in recent years on the care of people at the end of life. We hardly hear any serious criticism of hospice care; the big problem with hospices is that they are too few and far between.Itwould bedecades before end-of-life care at home could be consistently at that level and suggestions thatgeneral hospital wardscould providehospice-standard care for those dying is disingenuous. Hospices achieve their reputation because they can concentrate on what they dobest. If hospices had to take undifferentiated emergencies day and night they would not cope either.   If we're going down the route of changing names because of historical associations, why stop at hospices? Let's change all the hospital names beginning with 'St.' and, while we're about it, all those beginning with 'Royal' because it could be offensive to Republicans!   I have no religious affiliations but, when I'm dying,I doubt that I'llworry about the beliefs of thoselooking after me if they're doing a good job.One's last days are probably notthe ones in which to make enemies! One of thehospitals in which I did some work was run by an order of nuns. I can honestly say it was the happiest working environment of any in which I worked and I know that was true for all other staff who included hindus and muslims. Religion never intruded into daily hospital life; my chats with the Sister Superior always ended in her saying 'God bless you' and if that was the worst thing anyone said to meit was a very good day.   If particular religious communities want end-of-life care specific to their beliefs that's fine; if the need is great enough I'm sure their communitieswill provide it; perhaps they even have better care at home.-w52c4eci0hwan8cxef7rlira6a9ba6a8al7d8i7g1	Maxim	25/2/2016 10:56 AM	0	0

But still I keep on getting patiets with atypical Rheumatoid Artheritis and SLE like symptoms, where I can not put a label on this patient.Recently I had a patient, 60 yrs old; having severe pain in small and large joints, particularly in MCP and shoulder joints on both sides. He became almost crippled as he could not grip and thing and he could not pick up any thing. All investigations were negative except ESR being 45 mm, and positive for CRP. He was referred to rheumatologist. He opined that in his opinion he is suffering from Psoriasis but could not be definite. Ultimately he is taking methotrexate along with steroids and NSAIDs.What percentage of this kind of patients remains unlabelled?	ranasaleem	23/6/2011 4:39 PM	0	0

49	9	1	Joint pain can be a manifestation of disorders confined to the joint and also of a number of systemic disorders. Identifying the cause of joint pain, therefore, can be difficult because of extensive differential diagnosis. In some cases the diagnosis may be hindered by atypical presentation (as in the elderly or immunocompromised), or masked in those with multiple comorbidities and / or symptoms. Consequently its prudent to keep the diagnosis open in patients who present with pain in multiple joints. For instance, what may begin as a monoarthritis may in course of time become polyarthritis, thereby necessitating a review of alternative diagnostic possibilities. Similarly, an elderly woman, diagnosed initially as RA, might later develop a molar rash and oral ulcer which would change the diagnosis to SLE.  A careful history and physical examination are essential which will help guide appropriate investigations and management. The most relevant aspects to decide are threefold: 1. 1 - Whether the underlying disorder is inflammatory or not. 2. 2 -Establish the type of onset (acute or otherwise), and its subsequent evolution (i.e. self-limiting, monoarticular, polyarticular symmetrical, polyarticular non-symmetrica. and  3. 3 - The presence of associated extra-articular and systemic manifestations (e.g. fever, rash, eye involvement, bowel symptoms, Raynauds, etc.) The majority of conditions are benign and self-limiting, but a minority (trauma, sepsis, gout) may require an urgent assessment and treatment.  Presently, in many rheumatologic disorders, applying information from various imaging modalities, such as conventional radiography, CT, MRI, arthrography, bone scintigraphy, and ultrasound within the context of the patients history and clinical presentation can help select the best test and lead to a reliable diagnosis, appropriate therapy, and overall better patient care with lower costs and risks.-cg5caaaaa7daaa7paaa00a617107c01a0	csm@csm	27/6/2011 5:51 AM	0	0

51	9	1	Its a common knowledge that ESR,CRP are nonspecific indicators of inflammation, not useful as screening tests for rheumatic diseases, and cannot differentiate one disease from another. Repeated studies of workup for polyarticular complaints and rheumatoid disease demonstrate many variable factors (e.g. age, gender, pregnancy, comorbid diseases, etc.) associated with CRP/ESR discordance. In many studies ESR and CRP values were modestly correlated with each other and they were weakly correlated with disease activity measures. These data suggest that another look at the role of ESR and CRP as markers of inflammation in RA patients seen in routine care may be in order.  Some studies state that it is not necessary to obtain both ESR and CRP measures for clinical disease activity assessment in clinical trials of RA. Neither test adds significantly to clinical measures of disease activity including joint counts and global assessments. Where available, the CRP alone may be preferred for disease activity assessment as a simple, validated, reproducible, non age-dependent test. In office practice, test selection is generally guided by whether the clinical assessment suggests inflammatory or noninflammatory disease. One inquires into the characteristic hallmarks of inflammation: redness, warmth, soft-tissue swelling, and tenderness. If such symptoms are localized to and encompass an entire joint, one has excellent presumptive evidence for synovitis and an inflammatory process. A good history and clues on physical examination increase the pretest probability by asking questions that support the diagnosis of inflammatory arthropathy or systemic rheumatic disease.  In general, although ESR / CRP can be helpful to monitor certain patients, laboratory measures cannot serve as a gold standard for diagnosis and management in all individual patients with RA or any rheumatic disease. I suppose, we (and our patients as well) would benefit from an improved understanding of the limitations of laboratory tests in diagnosis and management of patients with rheumatologic disorders.-bp129k9tbx2knm	csm@csm	27/6/2011 12:40 PM	0	0

So how to choose ? Went I had a THR recently I said to the surgeon beforehand I would prefer LMWH to a NOAC and he more or less I think felt that was not now a surgical decision and would leave it to me or the hospital protocol. The hospital then said that it had changed back to LMWH in view of side effects with NOAC , so no problem there. I was then asked about a district nurse giving the injection which seemed a pretty ridiculous idea. Surely the NHS should not be funding that sort of activity unless there really is a special need ? Talk about ""nanny state"" - if an able person declines to do something as simple as that , then offer aspirin or warfarin as an alternative .... A similar problem arises with diabetics who refuse to inject themselves when otherwise quite capable.   Of course the real problem is the numbers on long-term antioagulation.

79	14	1	Dear All   Last week was a roller coaster of events and emotions. When I came into this job 5 months ago, I came into it because frankly I was angry at how I felt my friends, my colleagues and I were being treated. I absolutely could not stand the idea of having something being imposed upon us by a government that has no clue what it is we do.   Over the last 5 months I have felt like many of you in our need to moderate our language, I know that my job is not to simply represent my frustrations, but to stand up for all of our collective interests whether junior doctors or the patients we look after. JDC members are often the same, they represent the views of their regions with a passionate resolve to do the best for the doctors they have in their patch. I have seen the same from representatives across the board this year, whether they are college trainee groups or specialty organisations. I have seen junior doctor leaders put aside previous silo competitive traditions and work together in a way that none of us have seen before. One thing I hope beyond everything else is that as a profession this has a longer term effect on our generation of doctors. We will work together in a collaborative way for the good of our profession, patients and the whole NHS in a way I have not seen previously. Over the last decade I have seen the bastardisation of the concept of clinical leadership by the department of health, turning it into a method of control where professionals are trained simply to follow instructions and kept in line simply out of fear of a loss of influence or position. Last week we have seen the outcome of that agenda, when clinicians stand up for themselves, their patients and what they think is right, the answer is aggression, bullying and being effectively screamed at, that the will of a politician or a government will simply be imposed on those that disagree. So much for independent clinical leadership or professionalism.   On Tuesday I met with Sir David Dalton at his request. I have been clear throughout the last few months that last minute offers in general are highly inappropriate as the government has had three years to make fair offers. We have tried to talk, to negotiate in good faith. We have represented our members, but we have also been of a clear view that our members believe in a sustainable NHS. Retention of the doctors in the UK is our number 1 priority as without the talented individuals that deliver the frontline of the NHS, it is our patients that ultimately suffer. I notice in the latest HSJ article, Sir David has misrepresented that meeting and the clear view I expressed that I know I heard from many doctors throughout the NHS. We are always happy to negotiate, but a negotiation has to involve recognising both sides views and priorities. We had spent a huge amount of time and effort consulting with you our membership, looking at the stated aims of the government in terms of priorities, but also using our experiences of the frontline so solve the contractual dispute to the satisfaction of all parties. We understood compromise was necessary, however we also assumed that compromise was needed from both parties.   The issue regarding out of hours has been attempted to be boiled down to simply about pay. When we constructed our structure of pay, we also took into the implications and considerations of the needs of the NHS. If you simply move money into basic salary and undervalue the out of hours components of the salary structure, you create perverse incentives as the relative value of time out of hours diminishes. This has a knock on effect as it creates a driver that devalues specialties that have heavy out of hours commitments relative to others. This could have a further destabilising effect on the delivery of those services as already overstretched services become less popular due to their relative differences. Therefore we wanted to create a system of pay that valued time appropriately especially when we want to retain and recruit staff into those specialties. The issues regarding front loading and flattening of the pay scale were specifically trying to square a circle of a treasury red line of the removal of automatic pay progression from the public sector and a desire to ensure that we did not penalise or perpetuate the gender pay gap. We also wanted a system of pay that ultimately benefited the next generation of doctors that ensured that the wage inflation compared the to cost of living inflation benefitted the doctor starting out on their career and considering the debts students now qualify with. If nothing else, this structure showed our absolute attempts at addressing competing interests that many felt were insurmountable. Our structure of pay involving appropriate rewards for unsocial hours was also staff group specific. With the majority of the staff group being at a stage in life when families and childcare was inevitable. It was important that appropriate account was taken for this to try and retain highly trained staff as they balance competing interests of family life and professional responsibilities.   On the issues around NROC, we identified early that this was an area that was particularly of concern. We have experience of NROC on our negs team, however the full extent of the varied and diverse working structures meant we were absolutely clear we wanted to consult further on this area. However we were also absolutely clear that the government position of continuously comparing the roles of junior doctors with more senior staff where the range and types of responsibilities are different does not make sense. percentages of values that are so very different also have an impact, and where the financial barrier to rostering practices that have the potential to take advantage of junior doctors cannot be sanctioned. Again there was an absolute refusal to understand the concerns we described and the needs of the service were always paramount - a concept we can all sign up to if those needs are not so dangerously overstretching staff that doctors and patients are forced into dangerous situations. We suggested a proper consultation and testing of positions, however this has now obviously been rejected.   The experience of all negotiators over the last three years have been of negotiating partners that continuously introduce new objectives very late in the process, - 7 days services (June 2015) First refusal on medical time (January 2016) to name two, and yet cry foul if we attempt to suggest that these involve a requirement for additional resource or that they are undeliverable due to the current overstretched staff. There is also a continuous disingenuity in that compromises made are often rowed back on and so promises can never be trusted. Add to this toxic mix continuous political interference for objectives that have nothing to do with the service or patient care, but entirely focussed on soundbite politics and a constant need to look like there is a political victory to be had. You see why this whole sorry episode has been a lesson for the NHS and the medical profession in all that is fundamentally wrong with our current system. The department and NHSE in particular, fundamentally entered this whole negotiation with seemingly the attitude they had to teach the medical profession a lesson and put them in their place following previous negotiations.   So the contract that has been described has several aspects that are fundamentally unfair, the distribution of resource across the whole week, the first refusal on medical time, the nature of NROC, the ultimate safety mechanisms in the contract and the confidence we can have in them, the delivery of many of the mechanisms that are reliant on collaborative working, the ultimate appeals mechanisms for dangerous activity. There have been a hell of a lot of gains as a result of our attempts to outline what junior doctors do from modifying the flawed pay structure, some of the safety limits, making a fundamentally unworkable safety mechanism have some resemblance of what could work if there was any trust left in the system. However there is so much still flawed with this system. If this was about comparing what we currently do, its easy to misrepresent the situation. But its the nature of the services and distribution of staffing projecting forward and overstretching those staff that is so flawed. There is an absolute finite staffing resource. You cannot deliver a 7 day service when the current 5 days is falling apart and is dangerous.   Several times over this process we have tried to suggest that its in no ones interest to have this damaging fight, however that is not simply solved by the medical profession being taught a lesson. In November despite an incredible mandate, we called on the government to enter Acas to find a solution, in December despite last minute interference again to try and prevent a deal being found, we were able to find the starting point for negotiations and we stood down despite significant mistrust and strength of feeling. In January despite every attempt to find a solution to the problems we all could see, giving Sir David Dalton the space to come in and pulling more industrial action to give us all the space to find solutions, we still faced this intransigence and absolute unwillingness to compromise for political reasons. We had suggested that for the last few weeks that the whole situation has got out of hand and it would be in everyones interest to step back from the abyss and try and solve the issues of morale amongst junior doctors. Build trust back in the system and try and solve some of the educational shortcomings in the current system. Unfortunately once again machismo and political interference took precedence and rather than seeing we had one opportunity to try and stop a damaging course of events, the day after junior doctors across England go out on industrial action and feelings are elevated, the Secretary of State decides now is the appropriate time to show how deeply muscular the government is. Obviously burying bad news about waiting time figures - the first time ever that the target for routine operations has been missed, or that the departments budget has been exceeded due to massive mismanagement and requires a treasury bailout, I am sure had nothing to do with making a political announcement to destroy the last vestiges of morale in the junior doctor workforce in this country.   What next is what every junior doctor and the wider profession is asking? Well the government has published a very short summary of the some aspects of the contract they intend on imposing. We need to truly look at this and the implications. We can already see significant shortcomings that mean this proposal is not something junior doctors have stated they would sign up to. But unlike the government, the JDC and the BMA do want to actually listen to our members. Below is a list of open meetings I will be attending:   Monday 15th Norfolk and Norwich Hospital Mess meeting 12.30pm  Monday 15th East of England RJDC, Clinical School, Addenbrookes, 7pm  Tuesday 16th Bristol for joint RJDC/Bristol Divisional meeting 7pm  Wednesday 17th East Midlands RJDC meeting TBC  Thursday 18th South Thames RJDC - BMA House 6.30pm  Friday 19th West Midlands RJDC - Birmingham Chamber of Commerce 75 Harborne Road, Edgbaston Birmingham B15 3DH 7pm   There are also open RJDC meetings:   Monday 15th Northern RJDC Royal station hotel Newcastle 6.30pm  Tuesday 16th Oxford RJDC - John Radcliffe Lecture theatre 2, 6.30pm   We will look much more into the detail of the proposals should we get detail and look at where these will need to be challenged. We will seriously now have to consider every option available to JDC and consider what is in the best interests of our generation and the next of doctors, our wider profession, the NHS and our patients. Ultimately we cannot sit by and watch the government alienate a generation of doctors and thereby destroy the NHS we work so hard every day to make better and protect. The governments aim maybe to teach the medical profession a lesson, but in doing so they have shown their willingness and almost eagerness to destroy our NHS. The government often whispers about this as their miners moment. What happened with the mining industry? Is that what this government envisages for the NHS?   It is time for us all the take stock. The staff of the NHS never asked for unfair payrises, we never destroyed the financial system, we didnt abuse our positions for personal gain. All we want is to be treated fairly and to not have the organisation we love and dedicate our lives to be destroyed by a government that puts their personal gain above the people they are supposed to represent.   I will say one last thing, its very easy to make this about Jeremy Hunt. But fundamentally, deep down, I think we need to squarely lay the blame at David Cameron. He has stood by and ensured that ultimately the NHS he claimed to want to protect has been systematically destroyed since being elected by attacking the very staff that sweat blood and tears trying to protect it, work for it and love it.   Best wishes   Johann   ps you will hear from JDC in due course.-547398fnhdv08bpkcctcf9pl0c5scey2	Johann Malawana	15/2/2016 12:26 PM	1	0

81	15	1	Hello :)   I am currently an FY2 in Scotland and will be taking a year (possibly 2) out of training to do some locum work and gain more clinical experience, as well as some post graduate education, with the ultimate aim of applying for radiology.

In terms of post graduate education, I thought about doing a part time distance PGCert in medical education and/or medical ethics, both areas of personal interest.

83	15	1	Dr.polly,   You say you don't intend to go and work abroad, but if you firmly want this break from the training treadmill, I would urge you to do so!  I did this, rather later in my training, when such opportunities existed. I don't think they do now, so you may not get that opportunity again.   I think that my experience abroad, in the Netherlands and Sweden, broadened and shaped my practice ever afterwards, to my benefit and that of my patients.   Those were ordinary hospital jobs - today, I would look to go with one of the many charities that organise medical work in the Third World, because that would expose me to completely different facilities, techniques, and diseases.  And becasue it is so worthwhile!   Best wishes   John-4ptb8exmb8qn	John D	8/6/2016 8:39 AM	0	0

If you are interested in Aesthetic medicine then go on a Botox and Dermal filler foundation training program and you can start work immediately. The money is great and the work life balance is there. Its a new profession and will soon be recognised by the GMC as a subspeciality. With the right training you can get on that ladder before the regulations change and it becomes harder.

90	17	1	Hello all. I'm new here.   I've been working as a neurologist for a private hospital in Spain for the last 5 years. My job is stable and my earnings are enough for my family of four, yet I don't feel comfortable enough to get a mortgage, for instance.   There's things I don't like about living in Spain (I'm an italian citizen raised in South America, BTW) and sometimes me and the wife harbor a feeling that we would be better off in the UK both environmentally and financially as well as academically (for the kids).   On one hand, my job here is rather great for my quality of life: My regime is M-F, no night shifts nor weekends. Alas, I know that it's a characteristic of my specific workplace and if I was terminated no other option would be as good as this one. The public system is exploiting new doctors at the moment with temporary contracts that last a day only or even less than that. Also, my gross earnings are half or less than half of a Consultant's and they're likely to remain the same.   I have been talking to colleagues in Spain that went to the UK for various reasons, but the only neurologist in the group had been a junior doctor in a huge hospital in London. I aim for a rather small hospital towards the north of England.   So, I come to the forum asking for experiences and knowledge that could be useful for me in order to make a decision, should I stay or should I go. How is a consultant's work in a normal-ish hospital, how is the work load. How is it measured. Is it true that reports must be made by dictation for a remote secretary, or are doctors allowed to type them by themselves? Are they involved in many administrative decisions? How does one get certified and recertified? Is it as draconian as in the US?   Thank you very much for your tips.	mipial	9/5/2016 12:42 PM	0	0
91	17	1	"mipial,   In the Uk we should be flattered that you wish to move here, and gratfeul if you do - there is a shortage of neurologists in the NHS.   But please do your homework!  Houses are very expensive in the UK - prices in Spain have fallen by 35%, but risen by 25% in the UK, in the last ten yearshttp://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/price-change-10-years   I cannot speak for neurologists, but for NHS consultants, Hippocrates words which I have slightly adapted are true, ""Horis longa, domestica vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum pericilusum, iudicium difficile""  and add, ""pauperes sustinere""   You may be familiar with the English expression, ""The grass is always greener"", mipial.

92	17	1	"Thanks a lot for your answer.   Inded, house prices have risen in the UK and dropped a bit in Spain. I've been following that for some time now. The bailing-out for the banks prevented them from really plummeting in Spain, though.   Still, the political stability in Spain in the short range cannot be taken for granted and that keeps me from making such a long lasting investment. Not just because of the possibility of being sacked, but because my own savings could be on the stake as well (look up ""corralito"").   Your latins hold the details of what I'd like to know. I think most specialists here would say the same about the public system. Still, I'm at a good salary range at a gross 60k  (roughly 42k  after income tax) though living expenses may be no more than 1/3 higher in the UK than Spain (been there last summer).   BTW, the grass is not just greener: In the southeast of Spain -where I live- there is no grass!   Thanks again!      Mipial-fzz309832bo"	mipial	9/5/2016 5:28 PM	0	0

I cannot imagine all my efforts being worthless. Simply if I am not a doctor what could I be???   Now I am asking the community is there any way for me to get back to my professional life without having to redo my studies?	Muhibatrasul	5/5/2016 3:39 PM	1	0

95	18	1	"Muhibatrasul,   As Dr.Chid suggests, the ways back into practice will depend on where you are.  In the UK, after eight years without working, undergoing appraisal and being re-validated you will lose your registration as a doctor with the General Medical Council.  Other countries will have different rules, but it is clear that anyone after such a long time away from medicine will need to refresh their old knowledge and update themselves on new techniques and drugs.   The duration of that refreshment will depend on you.   You might like to read this, ""Return to practice guidance"", published by the Academy of Royal Colleges:http://www.aomrc.org.uk/doc_view/9486-return-to-practice-guidance .  It applies to the UK, but has universal advice, especially on having an ""Action Plan"" for your refreshment, and lists questions you should ask yourself and which potential employers and colleagues will ask you, to which you should have answers.  It mentions similar guidance avalilable in the US under ""physician re-entry"" (presumably from Earth orbit!).   If there is a professional organisation in your country, for medicine and/or anaesthesia, then I suggest you ask them about this.  They will know the local rules, and may be able to help you find a department of anaesthesia that will support your return to work.   The very best of luck!

98	19	1	"Over 50k people have signed an online petition in support of a junior doctor strike in the UK.   This is a response to the government's plans to impose a new contract for doctors in training which is likely to increase working hours and reduce pay.   It is proposed that basic pay will increase but the definition of ""sociable hours"" will be changed from 0800-1900 Monday to Friday to 0700-2200 Monday to Saturday which means junior doctors will not be eligible to receive supplemental pay (non-pensionable banding supplements) for work unless it occurs outside these times.   From the Review Body on Doctors and Dentists Remuneration (DDRB)paper, ""Contract reform for consultants and doctors & dentists in training  supporting healthcare services seven days a week""          It is also implied that doctors on maternity, paternity or sickness leave, those working less than full time, and those without a training number would not be eligible for the annual incremental pay increases that most UK doctors currently receive. Instead, pay increases would correspond with stages of training/increases in responsibility (rather than time served or years of experience).     Kitty Mohan, co-chair of the BMA's Junior Doctors' Committee, suggests the following to juniors doctors:   1. The DDRB recommendations affect different people in different ways. If you have not yet managed to do so, please do read the juniors section of the DDRB report published on 16th July. It can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contract-reform-for-consultants-and-doctors-and-dentists-in-training-supporting-healthcare-services-seven-days-a-week   2. Talk to your colleagues at work and make sure they are as informed as you. Start with other junior doctors but please do talk to other doctors, nurses and other health professionals. We are still being contacted by juniors who have no idea what is going on and if this affects them. Lets be clear, this affects us all.   3. Talk to your medical students, this will be their future contract, and to non-medical families and friends. Encourage them to spread the words regarding the concerns as well.   4. Many of your Royal Colleges may have already made a statement regarding junior contracts but please continue to lobby your College, Faculty or Royal Colleges. Weve seen Royal Colleges both speak out strongly against the changes, and those who feel this isnt their concern. The implications of a disenfranchised and devalued medical workforce affect everyone. Lobby your specialty trainee group as well  the more people who speak out against the changes the better.    5. Contact your local and regional BMA junior doctors reps and tell them your thoughts on what the next steps should be. The list of the Regional Junior Doctors Committee Chairs can be found at http://web2.bma.org.uk/rjdc   If you are a local or regional BMA junior doctor rep, please discuss these issues with your local and regional members and canvass their views on next steps over the next few days. We want to hear from as many people as possible. Or email Andrew and myself at jdcchair@bma.org.uk . Thank you to the many of you who have contacted us so far.   6. Attend one of the NHS Employers junior doctors engagement events. Details of the events can be found atNHS Employers   7. Please take to Facebook and Twitter and share your concerns. On a simple level the more voices heard, and the more concerns raised the better. It is the level of outrage by junior doctors and their supporters that has turned this into a news story. Please get involved in discussions and debates, write blogs or opinion pieces, and generally do everything you can to get out messages out there.   8. Finally, whatever your opinion of the BMA is, the protection BMA membership affords regarding our terms and conditions is unparalleled. Please remain a member or consider rejoining. This is the single biggest threat to the terms and conditions of current and future junior doctors.-z68ha6kwrqd4its0wga56bjh9uu88125h0rbax37bna83k3ki"	Sabreena	21/9/2015 2:34 PM	2	0
99	19	1	In spite of my outrage and fury, I have voted no.   The reason for this is that I believe that any strike will do more harm than good. During the last strike on June 21st 2012 over pension changes, it was estimated that about only eight per cent of NHS doctors took part in the protest. It was a flop andthere is absolutely no point in considering this as a viable strategy again. In all honesty none of us have the stomach for a fight in this way anyway. A true strike would mean no working for all doctors and inevitably guaranteed deaths for a number of patients. A tube train driver may be able to cope withthe consequencesof long bus queues in London and traffic chaos, but I don't think any of us could cope withthe loss of even one childdying of an asthma attack.Many would have to die to force the Government's hand and the public would never later forgive the profession for theloss of their loved ones.The stakes are too high and would lead to immediate fractures inour battle lines ascolleagues either deserted abroad in horrororslunk back to work defeated, guilty and broken.There is little point therefore in threatening to engage in a battle that none of us can stomach and afterwards would make us even more vulnerable.Once one person dies, we'll all be very sorry and collapse, but without the threat of a death, we've got nothing.   The prize we are fighting forare millions of pounds held by a full-time professional organisation who are experienced and skilled at achieving their wishes by ruthlessly manipulating people. What really do you thinkare the skill sets required to succeed as a politician? Now, do you really think a bunch of part-time amateurs with no stomach for a fight should be making threats that they will not see through as a good strategy for victory?   Ifwe are going to fight,we should be almost certain thatwe are going to win beforewe deploy any of our limited amateur forces. We should be aware of our weaknesses inthat we are not by nature aggressive, not by nature cohesive and not in a financial position to fight for very long. Our opposition are aggressive, very cohesive and have a lot of money. Their weakness lies in the ballot box and their four year life-cycle. Here is the only place and timeto attack them and have any chance of real victory. We should not therefore squander our energies on some futile gesture that will only disillusion our foot soldiers and makeour leaders appear incompetent.-mm8dvlqa5g0a0a1jza8dt7bc1c6uwfya5uwa6a0a8f0fzh4	Adrian Leahy	22/9/2015 2:36 PM	3	0
100	19	1	Adrian   I hear what you are saying, but there are ways to deal with your concerns.   For example, in A&E, nurses could still triage and those who are not deemed life threatening or likely to be life threatening without the intervention of a Doctor, don't get seen until after the strike. You would need to maintain a presence in resus for obvious reasons, but that is a only a very small percentage of those who should be on strike.   For the other hospital specialities, any Doctors on the picket line could carry a pager. The reason for use being clearly stated that it is only for emergencies where that specialities attendance cannot wait.   As for GP's...well that could be a complete strike. Emergencies shouldn't be going to GP practices and anyone trying to circumvent the strike by going to A&E will have a very long wait!   It may sound simplistic, but a similar system worked when the ambulance service went on strike. There were crews who volunteered to go to cardiac arrests and other life threatening calls whilst on strike...everything else waited.   The fire service are experts at going on strike and they also operate a similar system!   Now, if you were to tie in the day/s of your strike/s with the ambulance service, it would be even better!      That being said, it requires people to take part. The problem is that most people say there's no point in taking industrial action as it won't change anything. Subsequently, ballots don't represent how people feel as most people don't vote and then when it comes to industrial action there's a poor commitment from workers!-z35b3jmg6ilmyb0	ph80	22/9/2015 4:11 PM	2	0
101	19	1	As a profession we're a bunch of cowards. We'll always find excuses not to strike. The public do not care about us and government does not care about us. What they do know is that we are our own worst enemy.   If you ask me do I care about patient safety the answer is absolutely yes; if you ask me do I care about it more than my health and the health and future of my family the answer is absolutely not.   When do we draw the line if not now? If the powers that be decided suddenly that we be payed 1 per day for the same hours we do now would we still play the 'patient safety' card?   Let's consider the Fire Service strikes of the early Noughties - long story short many complained people would die due to the strikes but eventually public sympathy sided with the firefighters; the government was forced to recruit Army and RAF fire crews. My point is that if we make a stand, a real, solid, united stand then other options will arise because they are out there.  Rant over for now.-mx2	Mobe	22/9/2015 4:38 PM	5	0

Yet the way it is being portrayed must lose a certain amount of sympathy for the BMA. 13.5 % (I think that is the figure) pay rise on basic pay must make many employed folk envious. Perhaps those golden contracts from many years ago making overtime payments such a large proportion of income on some contracts were inappropriate - we should have concentrated on fighting for more doctors.   I also think the objections to Saturday working are open to criticism - I can see how Jewish doctors might object on religious grounds- but many doctors seem prepared to work Sats if extra pay is on offer. My impression is that many folk do now work on a Saturday , even if not ""at work"" in the usual sense. My limited experience of working Saturday clinics is that they were appreciated by many patients.   So more and more I am coming across the impression that this strike is now about the question of money and that public support is beginning to wane. Perhaps a ""working to rule"" will be more effective than further strikes. We need some form of resolution for future planning.   Those doctors interviwed who talk about ""quitting medicine"" - as opposed to moving elsewhere - certainly lose much of the sympathy which I had initially. Maybe they would not be able to take the coming pressures anyway."	sken	12/2/2016 1:50 PM	0	0
111	21	1	But Sken, the question is not if doctors should work on Saturdays, at whatever scale of pay, but if more of them should (and Sundays, of course, that IS the Hunt Plan - 24/7 NHS, remember?   Possibly not so bad for consultants in some specialties, much worse for others, but when the shift system means that trainees are resident for part of weekends than a one-in-whatever would indicate, then this will make family life for them even worse, and mean that they will be at work for more days than at present.

112	21	1	"John D - I have been awaiting events - and still am. I understand the points you make and have little (no) doubt that what is proposed is harmful and based on bad evidence. The problem is much wider than being just about doctors. We do not have staffing levels for a week-end service , so this can only be provided at a cost to weekdays - decreasing the service during those days is of course one way of levelling out any differences.   Any politician aiming for a compromise could have achieved one. Trying to buy off doctors with a background offer of a large pay rise has made it look like a matter about money but missed the point in many ways. It is what politicians had already tried with waiting -list initiatives when the amounts of money for extra lists were sometimes clearly OTT. A reasonable compromise now would have been to settle for Saturday morning as a normal working time with full back-up services.   The reason I wonder about further strike action being of value is that I see this as disruptive and stressful for those concerned whilst fighting a battle which really needs wider involvement. The public voted in the present government knowing that week-end working was part of the plan for the NHS. This is a battle in which the public has to share. Initial support seems to be dwindling - remember how the public supported the Iraq war , then changed its mind? Our obsession with instant access is fuelling the present crisis.   In my time the only politician who seemed to grasp the fundamental of the medical market was Barbara Castle - create more doctors than jobs to go around. Since her day this has no longer feasible since there are now so many doctors anyway and vast numbers of ideas about how to deploy any extra.   Other than emotion I am not sure the public cares about the NHS quite so much as at one time nor I suspect does the media. Seeing it as a ""religion"" does not help - it leads to a belief in a permanence that may be unreal   One only has to look at the present campaigns on food and drink - plenty on how it affects the individual but often precious little on how it impinges on the NHS services and opportunity costs for others - other than a general assumption that the NHS will restore folk to normality.   Doctors may need to vote with their feet whilst they can. On our local news recently there was comment that down here in the South-East we now have the worst figures for unfilled physician posts in the country.    I think my views on the usefulness of continuing strike action have changed - the fight for a rational approach to NHS services is not one which the juior doctors can fight on their own. The public is about to be entertained by various showmen politicians on the European Union , together with the USA election and a number of new serials on TV. In the meaantime new contracts will begin to be imposed as rota plans for the coming months need to be in place. Not an ideal time to try to grab centre stage?   PS I think the proposed attempt to take legal action an alternative to strike action which I would support.-w34fzytqtjd4t2krhm"	sken	22/2/2016 10:26 AM	0	0
113	21	1	It might be best for the BMA to !obby Foundation Trusts about the benefits to their recruitment of offering non-Hunt contracts.  I know this would leave non-foundations in the lurch, but would place the staffing problem right back in the Gov's lap. I fear they would just pass emergency legislation depriving Foundations of their freedom, but that would reveal their duplicity.   John-xfk7iy	John D	22/2/2016 10:53 AM	0	0
114	21	1	"Years ago the BMA ""blacklisted"" some posts - just adding a comment with a warning when the jobs were advertised. I think the strikes achieved quite a lot but that now is the time for a different strategies. Hospitals having to restrict acute services because of failure to recruit will go down very badly with the public and the responsibility will be directed away from striking doctors and put (as it should be ) in the lap of central government even if local managers have to take some of the flak.   I am not unduly worried about emigration as I think if the NHS house is put in order many of those moving out may want to come back."	sken	22/2/2016 12:05 PM	0	0

119	23	1	"The UN team has spent some time weighing up the rights and wrongs of how Julian assange has been treated and on strong grounds has come to the conclusion that he should be released. As I gather he might well be anyway if the more recent relevant UK laws were applied retrospectively. UK and Sweden prefer to ignore international law.   The whole business seems somewhat malodorous - he is not charged with an offence under Swedish law - just ""wanted for interview"" which could easily have been carried out in the UK. The whole business seemed designed to expedite his exradition to the USA , which has a very limited view of justice in this respect and a very punitive approach to anyone who might have upset them.   It would be healthy for medicine and nursing generally for whistleblowers if a conciliatory and compromise approach was adopted. Those readers of Private Eye will have seen recently - in some detail - how very critical a judge has been of the way in which the nursing hierarchy treated a whistleblower to the point of suggesting the evidence used against her was falsified her : the high court judge apparently felt ""there had been ""a crude attempt to frame her"".   The message that one has an obligation to whistleblow in the knowledge that doing so is likely to lead to persecution , loss of employment and be generally destructive of family life is the wrong message.   Of course I am not suggesting investigation into a charge of rape should be dismissed but that should be a separate issue. Currently it seems that Sweden does not have the evidence to make a charge and is not primarily interested in that aspect of the overall case.

121	23	1	John D - There was a lot on it in the Guardian to-day . At least in the on-line version - including an article arguing against the UN opinion (or at least some of it). I would be less critical than you about someone who does not wish to face imprisonment (if not some form of torture) for something many would view as an injustice.   Equally , I am very wary about just rubbishing the opinion of a recognised court for human rights rather than challenging the verdict in a legitimate way.	sken	5/2/2016 8:20 PM	0	0
122	23	1	I don't think Assange is a good example to use of whistleblowing. Wikileaks released en masse classified documents without being in a position to know what the repercussions might be. Whilst I too have concerns about government secrecy and conduct some degree of secrecy is essential for military, defence, commercial and diplomatic reasons. Assange aims to make governments more transparent but he doesn't regard transparency of his own conduct as being fair. He refuses to say who funds wikileaks, where it is based etc. Whilst we may have concerns about the conduct and policies of our governments at least in democracies governments are elected and there are checks and balances regarding what should be private and what should be for public consumption. Assange is self appointed and has decided he knows best what classified information should be available to be read by foreign intelligence agencies and hostile governments. It may well be that analysts advising governments are more reluctant to be frank with their opinions because they fear reading about themselves on the internet. It is telling that he only releases information about the US military and not about Russian or other countries that might worry us. It is also ironic he - as an investigative journalist - sought sanctuary in the Ecuadorian embassy, a country usually quite content to ensure their own journalists are muzzled and mistreated.   He seems to think that he is exempt from the law. He has had his case heard right up to the Supreme Court and without exception they have all ruled against him. The Swedish courts have also followed due process and issued a European Arrest Warrant. He fled bail and voluntarily went into a Diplomatic limbo (a flagrant abuse of Diplomatic Immunity - you cannot just declare a non national a diplomat of your nation). He can leave at any time hence the UN ruling is quite bizarre. The UN panel is not a court and does not have that authority nor is its opinion legally binding. People keep saying that Assange has not been charged with anything only wanted for questioning. You cannot charge anyone with an offence unless and until you have arrested them, hence the EAW. Assange was a frequent visitor to Sweden and only decided their legal system could not be trusted when he was accused of rape. Sweden has an excellent legal system which could certainly teach Ecuador a great deal about justice. The offences he is accused of are very serious and his alleged victims have rights just as Assange does. The irony is that it will be much harder to extradite him from Sweden to America than from the UK. He would be able to exercise his rights against extradition like any other citizen. It is quite wrong that an alleged criminal should dictate how he wants the legal system to operate. I think Assange and his lawyers know full well he is abusing the legal process because they have not petitioned The European Court of Human Rights. That is the court which might make a difference but they know there is no mileage in any such petition.   kirked-xu5fv1	kirked	6/2/2016 1:40 PM	0	0

One other point - I gather a Guardian journalist was complicit in releasing some of the encrypted information. Should action be taken against him and the Guardian as well?    Posted by sken   Many thanks sken,   Altogether there was seven media organisations which released batches of information (from The Guardian to CNN to Channel 4) and it would be impractical to identify and indict every individual involved in the process. As is the case with complex conspiracy cases it is usually the leaders or key participants who the law seeks to identify and put before the courts.   kirked	kirked	7/2/2016 7:46 AM	0	0
125	23	1	I can't see how this can end. Both the UK and Sweden are bound to consider extradition to the US (Mysteriously it doesn't seem to apply in the other direction, at least for the UK). The US is never likely to drop itswish to get Assange there, in which event he will undoubtedly disappear for a very long time.   I'm not quite sure why the US hasn't simply asked the UK to extradite Assange there. Perhaps the three countries involved have calculated that public opprobrium would be less in Sweden if he could first be charged and perhaps convicted there for rape. Sweden is reportedly not allowed to say it wouldn't extradite Assange. Neither presumably is the UK although I've read that extradition from Sweden would require permission from the UK as well. I guess that could be hushed up or made opaque.   Extradition and rendition seem different to me only insofar as the latter is unlawful and the Government, of the country from which the person is kidnapped, can pretend they didn't know anything about it. Ring any bells?   It's all too easy for Governments to say they support whistleblowing whilst making exception for anything that might embarrass politicians or expose lies. I don't know, and would never be allowed to know, whether Wikileaks has been of net benefit or harm to the public but it seems to me what we need is the sort of perfect lie-detecting software that would be applied to all public pronouncements by politicians. The sort of devicefor whichitsinventor had to be murdered in the 'entirely fictional' drama 'London Spy'.-5s4bog9a0orgxcvg9klgtktaj	Maxim	7/2/2016 5:40 PM	0	0

128	24	1	Thank you for all you are doing Johann.  I'm a GP, I'm VERY fearful for recruitment and the long term effects all this is going to have. Ihave seen a good practice just sell out to virgin care because they couldn't cope with the increase in demand. I myselfbecame very disillusioned in mainstream GP where I had a post as a salaried in view to eventual partnership.It wasn't for me, I wished to work with deprived communitiesand found I was struggling to keep my head above water in terms of patients' increasing demands and expectationsof a service that does not have the funding. I found myself not practicing with passion and instead, just practicing for the sake of it. I now work as a GPfor a not forprofit organisation for the homeless. I am sacrificing my NHS pension in order to practice in an area that allows me to remain passionate about medicine and my every day practice. But I fear for the rest of general practice and what is to become of the system. It can't cope as it stands.I know things will get worse, and I feel helpless in what can be done. Even if contracts improve, there will be a richochet effect and we will struggle to overcome this. We are struggling now. Although the march was good, I found myself quite deflated following it. I sat on the tube with a group of 'junior' anaethatistswho'd come down from the midlands and they were so low about their situation and the prospects of the future.What can I do?

Apart from looking at the ill effects of inappropriate attenmpts at resus , have their been any studies looking at the effects of training everyone , together with defibrillators on every shop shelf (slight overstatement) , on a public totally terrified by the very idea of death : does it reassure them or merely act in medieval style as reminder that death stalks the streets?

See this review:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222014/   It's becoming obvious that good technique is essential, because chest compression is a lousy way of getting a circulation; the right speed andkeeping it going are most important.

135	25	1	"John D - i expected an early and enthusiastic response... BUt we still need more balanced figures - absolute numbers and comparative costs. So a public education programme might be effective but how does this compare in terms of 1 year survival with education aimed at lifestyle advice? The figure given in one of your references from some years ago is $500 million per year for the USA.   What are the absolute numbers for more aggressive intervention over traditional involvement - again looking at 1 year survival not just short term ? These days just looking at survival to hospital discharge is not enough.   Many of the studies seem to assume a 100% death rate without CPR - are we sure that is valid ? Difficult to know - evidence for a major event requires skilled folk tp be present and one can scarcely hen withhold treatment. but we do need to know how many of those treated as arrests have some other problem.   Personally , I question whether the alternative is always so bad when one considers the 90% where the attempts may be pretty awful but where we will always lack follow-up. Some time ago in the UK a sudden death used to be seen as one of the better ways of leaving this world and this emphasis on prevention with CPR in almost every situation is a relatively recent cultural phenomenon.   I think one needs to be very wary about seeing chest compression as lousy - perhaps not ideal but a negative approach is a pretty major disincentive . I was not entirely clear whether other factors were relevant for those small numbers receiving AED in the study quoted - such as greater skill in those involved in the CPR attempts.   My worry is that we may be heading for every home to be equipped for full CPR - starting with those seen at most risk and with those who can afford it - and it is the effect of this on the psyche which I find particularly interesting. Particularly the feelings of blame that may be attached to family members who then ""fail"" to realise the hoped for result.-ky6c1"	sken	17/12/2015 5:19 PM	0	0

Because of their remote location, and time it would take for paramedics to arrive (a false reason, see above 1minute =10% less, but anyway) the Welsh NHShas provided an AED, and about 20 residents have been trained in its use.  Now they are looking for means to raise the alarm, so that someone can bring the AED to where it is needed. Oh, and they have no fast broadband.   An incomplete solution, but one that the Welsh NHS has invested in. (AED - 1000-1200, plus training.)  I suppose that last is what you ask about, and it's a fair question.

137	25	1	John D - Many thanks. I will have to work my way throught he references , but UK lags the world is I suggest a very limited geographical world. Do we have figures for say the big populations - China , India . Perhaps not Africa. The endstage of CKD perhaps involves 80 times as many patients in achieving my 1 year survival yardstick.   My main concern - what can be done is not necessarily what should be done is more of a philosphical question and I am not sure how far it can be resolved. The USA figures have also to be seen in the context of a different attitude to health care and one where there are even bigger Society issues when it comes to matters of life and death.   Incidentally , I think in the case of remote villages there is a place for some form of on site emergency care of this type. Whenever I hear of some residents living in the vicinity of our local hospital whing about their parking problems I lose sympathy. Their survival times would be pretty good compared to mine and just what did they expect when they moved there? Our village may not be remote by Welsh standards , but with poor phone , internet and GPS , no road names or house numbers being lost is a fact of life for those trying to find a given house.... but I promise to to whine as well if I expire waiting for the emergency services and as the years roll by might come to see this as a positive advantage of relative isolation.-6l1b1lsc06	sken	17/12/2015 9:04 PM	0	0
138	26	1	"Golly - I had a recent blg on the juxtaposition of some of my hobby horses in the news in the last couple of weeks , when the new editionof the JRSM * has just arrived with another one.   The article looks at perceptions and recall of consent for regional anaesthesia compared with those for surgery.   Essentially there were the results one might expect with a difference in how patients regarded the relevance of the 2 consents and in recall , but perhaps not quite so dramatic as one might have expected. There is still massive misunderstanding by patients about the purpose of consent with 50% believing the main purpose is as regards potential litigation and 60% that they could not withdraw consent once the form had been signed.   My own experiences with regional anaesthesia is that the problem rests in large part with the anaesthetist. For a brachial block I met the anaesthetist whilst waiting to be anaesthetised just outside the theatre and discussion was minimal - in the end there was a problem with access and he chose to anaesthetise me first. For my spinal I met the anaesthetist on the ward just before being taken to theatres. There was almost no discussion as I was clearly being ""processed"" as part of a list. Perhaps what is needed is an anaesthetic nurse or equivalent - my own anxieties related on both occasions more to the anaesthetic than to the surgery and I was fortunate in knowing how to inform myself about the procedures beforehand.   Over the years we have have had vast numbers of papers pointing out that doctors don't talk to patients when of course that it just how many of us spend our lives. I suspect here that the problem in large part relates to talking to patients at the wrong time.   Interestingly , in the past few days I went to a talk on laparoscopic colectomy - even in the best hands not quite as good as some feel. There was no mention about the anaesthatic challenges which led to my question about these.

139	26	1	"""A few more anaesthetic complications and deaths might help to concentrate the mind....""? Oh, please, no, sken!  The advance of surgery has progressed hand in hand with that of anaesthesia.  As new procedures or techniques are planned so the clinicians and academics from either specialty work out ways to exploit them.  But the first death attributed to anaesthesia occurred just over two years after ""Ether Day"" at the Massachussetts General Hospital and the fashion for the more potent and palatable chloroform killed many before the Hyderabad Commission made its dangers clear. But then John Clover invented the Clover bag to give known concentrations of the drug.  Open chest surgery was originally done with spontaneous respiration (What!?). I won't bore you with the details, but imagine the patient's head in a pressurised box, to keep the lung inflated, with a mask in it and gloves in the sides so that the anaesthetist could maintain the airway!  Open heart surgery, especially bypass, was marked by repeated failures, about which a chronicler described the surgeons as ""heroic"" for having pressed on in the face of successive patient deaths.  I hope - I most sincerely hope! - that anaesthesia will progress into the future without such a toll on our patient's lives. Yes, laparoscopic colon surgery requires the patient to be almost stood on their head, but the problems this causes were anticipated from the first - well, almost the first! - and as fas I know, no deaths can be attributed to the tecnique or to anaesthetic failings.    On consent, Anaesthesia is divided fromSurgery in that we do not obtain a signature. We have been advised that the patient's fist is no legal protection against the question, were they 'informed' in the legal sense. That surgeons still obtain a squiggle of ink is, I fear, more a tradition than a need.   The anesthetist who will care for that patient should discuss their case with them and record that discussion.  Clearly, this is open to omission, but the risks should be made clear and documented in the pre-anaaesthesia assessment.  What is a risk that the patient should be told about?  Legal precedent and advice is that it depends, on the frequency of the risk AND it's effect on the patient.  A sore throat after intubation might be ignored, as it is trivial and short lasting, even if it is usual (it is still worth mentioning!)  But long term paralysis after spinal anaesthesia is almost unknown, since the Wolley & Roe case of 1947, that outlawed the technique in the UK for a generation, but it is still told to patients, because the effect is so devastating.  Strangely, while death under anaesthesia occurs and not as rarely as paralysis, telling the patient that they might not wake up again is not on the list of risks that most UK anaesthetists will recount to their patients!

141	26	1	"John D - I should have made it more obvious that when I referred to deaths concentratig the mind , it was the minds of patient's to which I referred. I think anaesthetists are all too aware of the problems of anaesthesia but the public takes its safety too much for granted at times.   I think the area where we really do need more data is on the late sequelae of anaesthesia in general hospitals. This is particularly relevant where the elderly are concerned but such studies would be challenging to organise.   ""Injury to the larynx following intubation occurs in one-third of all patients"" ; the opening sentence in one of my journals this week. So folk should be warned. But it is the poorly documented late effects effects that concern me most - just how would anaesthetists know about these if they are real risks. i would reckon I have had at least 2 in my own experience but one just does not see the anaesthetist again to discuss them. Gerontologists are I think becoming increasingly aware of the possible deterioration in the elderly who have borderline brain function and where minor further disability may have considerable social effects.   I note Duane's point and still remember a patient where I explained that what I was about to do could kill her , as was my routine with some of the riskier procedures. Her response ? A very positive ""Good"" . Some patients are better prepared for heir demise that their doctors.   And there is always the problem of knowing just which anaesthetist to choose when faced with a choice. Interestingly , locally , in 3 separate conversations , the same name came up from a surgeon , physician and another anaesthetist...   PS The problems for the anaesthetist with these laparoscopic procedures are multiple.-2m0csi05"	sken	5/12/2015 6:02 PM	0	0

148	28	1	"Good question - it can be looked at in many ways. Marshall on Hp ranks highly with me not so much because of its world shattering effects , but because a) It provided an answer relevant for a common disease and b) it unveiled an answer to which clues had been been present for years but we did not think laterally - an eye opener for those of us who thought we were not biassed and blinkered.   Of course there have been papers with greater importance for mankind but in assessing ""best"" there should be more than just that - unravelling the human genome is good solid work but for me that type of pains taking worthy slogging away lacks the flair of ,say , Watson and Crick's original helix description. Worthy - often phenomenally worthy - slogging is also a term I would use for some of the vast multicentre double blinded trials that have emerged over the past 50 years. And the end paper is often just building and confirming what has gone before ; again highly worthy but (for me) missing that flair making it great.   For the medical profession the papers on Willowbrook (hepatitis) and Tuskagee (syphilis) are also relevant as they emphasise how narrow the dividing line can be between what could be accepted in the West and some of what happened under Hitler.-pq7a2"	sken	23/9/2015 10:35 AM	0	0

Here's a summary of the reported main points from speakers, other delegates at the conference, and on Twitter.  Iona Heath, ex-RCGP president, UK   There's no argument about statins lowering cholesterol. The questions are: Is it worth doing? And what are the side effects?   Time given to the well means time taken from sick.   We are still campaigning for individual patient data to be made available from trials  Rod Jackson, professor of epidemiology, Auckland, Australia   We've got enough evidence on statins. We should be doing trials on something else.  Klim McPherson, professor of public health epidemiology, Oxford, UK   People are taking statins without knowing the side effects. ""I think that's outrageous""  Ben Goldacre, author, broadcaster, campaigner, medical doctor and academic, UK   Lets offer n=1 trials as a clinical service to determine if side effects of statinsare due to drug or placebo.   It is unacceptable that statin trials are not made public.  Trisha Greenhalgh, doctor and academic, Oxford, UK   EBM is so old that most speakers in the Great Statins Debate are talking about their own cardiovascular risk and own statin [non]use.   Individualisation is a key issue. Can we systematically down-titrate dosage of statins to see if we can keep the benefits and reduce side effects?  Richard Peto, professor of medical statistics & epidemiology, Oxford, UK   There is adequate availability of data for the scrutiny of life-threatening side effects.  Rafael Diaz, cardiologist, clinical researcher, Argentina   Statins have hugely contributed to increased life expectancy in modern day due to unequivocal data and knowledge derived from EBM.

155	30	1	"I like the idea of doctor as ""decision aid"". As a profession we have a deep-seated aversion to giving up our perceived power base. To some extent this has been patient driven by their refusal to take responsibility for their share of any decision , but times could be changing. Bearing in mind that how the evidence is presented will influence how it is perceived - particularly as regards risk - we need to learn how to be neutral rather than portraying a point of view. We also need to stop wasting time over those areas where the significance of the decision is pretty minimal - option appraisals on borderline indications for statins are a good example.   Perhaps one approach might be to offer sheets on the lines of the BMJ ""Head to head"" reviews as well as a Google recommendation. Folk seem quite capable of researching the pros and cons of , say , a new car depending on their needs and requirements , so why not be prepared to let go our control where these decisions really are of borderline medical significance with no clear right or wrong?   There are 2 extremes. Firstly , the decisions where the evidence is clear enough and some. pressure has to be brought to make a ""right"" decision (eg polio immunisation) . Secondly , there are a few patients unable to or who refuse to .take these decisions. Delegation of the decision to the doctor will need to be documented as this delegation is still a form of patient decision which carries some responsibility on the part of the patient. We should perhaps assume the public has a certain degree of computer literacy rather than acting like old style doctors who felt that literacy of any sort resided primarily with the medical profession-f68"	sken	14/4/2015 2:41 PM	3	0
156	30	1	"I'm glad to clarify. I was actually suggesting that peopleshould go straight to Google and not via a doctor to make a decision about whether to take a statin for primary prevention. It isn't a futile quest because if you Google ""statin decision aid"" you will come up with three good ones in the first ten. There is an Option Gridcomparing the benefits and harms of dietary change, activity and statins, and also the NICE and Mayo Clinic tools, which incorporate full risk scores and graphical information about absolute risk figures. I think Sken is right: these figures will show people how different statin-taking is from polio vaccination, which gives 100% protection and protects others at the same time. Statins confer no benefit at all on most of those who take them, even for secondary prevention.      If the Evidence Live meeting illustrated one thing it was how futile it is to ask doctors for their advice on this particular subject. The ""experts"" ranged in the debate gave hugely different personal opinions about benefits and potential harms. The fact is that their opinions don't matter: it needs to be an individual choice, informed by the actual evidence. My own view is that these drugs should be available free and without prescription to anyone who wants them after making an informed decision. Free because there may be a societal advantage in preventing overall levels of cardiovascular disease (despite personal margins that most individuals would think worthless); but without prescription because a doctor need not be involved at all, except to be informedso that they can deal with adverse effects or potential druginteractions.      In summary: for symptomless people taking preventive measures, there is no need to involve a doctor. There is a need for clear honest individualised information which is fully understood - and this applies to screening too, though screening is mostly detection rather than prevention. Pharmacovigilance is usually done better by computers and/or pharmacists than by doctors. It is when people are ill and find options hard to understand or decide on that doctors need to be the decisions aids: it's our job. We shouldn't be distracted from it by spending so much of our time with the worried well, still less by worrying the well.-n43dta6wtr3y2b"	Richard Lehman	15/4/2015 7:13 PM	2	1
157	30	1	Richard   Im grateful for your clarification on what you actually said; in particular that you were talking primarily about prevention in asymptomatic patients and that you were advocating the use of on-line decision aids bypassing GPs or other clinicians.   Im intrigued by your suggestion that doctors are useless as sources of advice because they are offering opinions and that patients can better make informed choices by simply assessing the evidence. If I remember rightly, EBM was supposed to blend evidence with clinical judgement.   The decision-aids you mention are very good at explaining the implications of trial results but do we really believe that trial results on populations are necessarily enough to help individuals decide whether to take a drug for many years? To their credit, the decision-aids stress that prediction for individuals can be impossible. We can say with considerable certainty how an average number will behave but not individuals.   The decisions we make are influenced by multiple conscious and unconscious factors. Sometimes, as in the measles vaccination affair, the decisions can be swayed (rightly or wrongly) by influences that fly in the face of the evidence. People with capacity have every right to make their own decisions even if they appear capricious to others but they might deserve more help than go do the math. The responsibility of individuals to the health of the herd is a separate complex dilemma which is currently playing out in Australia.   There are several problems in simply referring patients to the literature:   1) Calculating the risk requires information for which a patient will need clinical help unless we are saying that all patients should buy sphygmomanometers and get laboratory tests done privately. Many patients with type 2 diabetes are unaware of it. Are we really saying the clinicians involved at that stage should not offer any guidance beyond referral to the internet? The decision aids actually state that they should be used in conjunction with clinical consultation.   2) Publication bias and, more worryingly, suppression of information can reduce the validity of decision aids, particularly in the information about unwanted effects.   3) Uncertainty is at the heart of clinical practice and we shouldnt always afford numbers special privilege when making difficult decisions particularly where, as you say, the risks and benefits are finely balanced. Whitehead put it clearly in his Introduction to Mathematics. There is no more common error than to assume that, because prolonged and accurate mathematical calculations have been made, the application of the result to some fact of nature is absolutely certain. Although opinions differ widely, dialogue remains important, even if only to check understanding and reasoning.   4) The sources of advice on-line are nearly endless. Presumably someones opinion will have to come into play when recommending the ones to believe. Left to their own devices patients could spend so long on-line that they might at least never take the drugs!   I actually agree with you about the lack of worth of statins in this group. I wouldnt take them and, despite the worrying number of studies decrying the value of diet and exercise, my unworthy opinion is that these drugs are vastly overused. The irony is that the medical profession is locked in endless wrangling about these drugs and yet the guidance on-line seems to ignore this.   I disagree with your suggestion but its a very valuable one for stimulating debate about the many facets of this whole business.-v97gxg7c3rhdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaada7fyhxg2qybyh0v4b9laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1j3bzfrjqg403486juea48gfhk3bxeu2b2rti6l666ab3	Maxim	17/4/2015 2:53 PM	0	0

168	32	1	Next week Ill be putting my head above the parapet and giving a couple of short talks atEvidence Live. One of them will be about how we try to fit patients to the evidence and the outcomes we want: it is so much simpler than seeing how much of the evidence actually applies to each individual and corresponds with the outcomes they want. My illustration will be heart failure. The median age of patients is 76 or more,they have other illnessesincluding whatever caused their heart to failthey are tired and scared. They know they are going to die, most probably from pulmonary oedema, and many of them have experienced how distressing and protracted that can be. The majority would rather have better symptom relief than a longer life. And they want a place of comfort and safety when they die, not rushed treatment in a noisy ward where they are just another old person with HF. One way to tackle this would be to provide them with patient centred disease management at home,and this was the laudable aim of John Rumsfelds PCDM trial reported in JAMA here. But the terse conclusion reads: This multisite randomised trial of a multifaceted HF PCDM intervention did not demonstrate improved patient health status compared with usual care. It is laudable that the authors chose this as their primary outcome measure and stuck with it. Had mortality been the criterion, this trial would have been a success. And levels of depression were significantly lower in the intervention group. Lets build on this great work and see if we can do better. We owe it to these millions of people ending their lives in distress.-pf6b5nhti02303bkba769cb3ainv2mr2	Richard Lehman	8/4/2015 3:38 PM	1	0

Most evidence or research conducted is funded by the pharma companies. There may be no other alternative system but further scrutiny from those who publish guidelines (NICE, Cochrane) is being requested to look a conflicts of interest not only of the funding of the trials but also who is conducting the trials and for what reason. Here's an extract:   ""without so called evidence there is no seat at the guideline table. This is the fundamental commissioning bias, the elephant in the room, because the drug industry controls and funds most research. So the drug industry and EBM have set about legitimising illegitimate diagnoses and then widening drug indications, and now doctors can prescribe a pill for every ill. The billion prescriptions a year in England in 2012, up 66% in one decade,2 do not reflect a true increased burden of illness nor an ageing population,3 just polypharmacy supposedly based on evidence.

171	34	1	In statistics they say 'torture the data and it will confess'. Transparency of study methodology and doctors' sharp skills in critical appraisal are safe-guards against Bias-Based Medicine. Any guidelines should delineate the concepts of efficacy, effectiveness on one hand; cost-effectiveness, availability and pharma-funded guidelines on the other hand. It is OK to say that drug X is best for disease Y, but we are using Z because it is available, cheaper or funded, let the doctors learn what they are doing.   How many good drug faded out and died, becuase their companies are no longer interested in producing them as their patency ended.

We have a robust and ever-changing armamentarium of drugs and products which are leading to the alleviation of all sorts of maladies; from Abilify to Zinnat , from total knees to CPAP.   If we relied on government for these innovations we would still be using foxglove, willow and cinchona bark.   Perhaps evidence-based medicine is imperfect, but give me an imperfect world and I will practice my art imperfectly.   There is a principle in the cosmos that the observer effects the observations.   Odysseus   P.S. I observe that many in the glass house of the NHS hate ""Pharma"" as you call it (we don't). People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. You work in a government monopoly which is one of the largest in the world and are salaried and thus not operating in a real market economy.-0o8"	Odysseus	10/1/2014 10:16 PM	0	0
175	34	1	"Agree with skyesteve. Of course we need all the data , but it is ridiculous to suggest that those with an interest should not take part , but this needs careful monitoring. It is not just the overt funding , but also statistical advice , ownership of results and cryptic inducements (goodwill support for meetings in foreign places etc... ) that need to be monitored.   It all goes way beyond just the pharmaceutical industry - empire building in the NHS can be a good thing - but can be detrimental to other aspects of the service as well. Yet where would we be if no-one pushed for their department to offer a better service? And that usually means having to raise money .   The problemms with EBM are not primarily due to drug firm involvement but in trying to make an evolving grey area into something static and black or white. And because they are ignored by anyone so inclined or if the patient demands something else because ""that is their right"".

178	34	1	"Involvement of parties that have interest can cause bias due t conflict of interest.   I agree that enterprise is important and given the right hands and circumstances it does create new possibilities thus enriching our pool of medications and procedures.   There is however also a downside to this. And that has to do with the inability f some people with very good ideas to get through and interest the pharma companies,   So, unless you have the abilities, and there is someone in the pharma indusry who is willing to take through your idea, it may well be lost and forgotten. And it can be better than something else already available, but it simply did not even get to the phase where it can be tested by EBM tools.   The other problem lies in the fact that once someone has invested large sums for developing something, if it turns out to be not that effective, financially it would be a ""bitter pill"" to swallow, so there is a risk of trying to ""play"" with data so it fits EBM criteria and be a ""success"".   Then, something can be successful, but there is something else no less successful, so again finances get in the way of science and science can be ""bended"".   What I say is that strong regulation and control by ministry of health and/or some other body such as the State ombudsman are needed to look after what is going on. Mainly in the sense of taking care that the game is fair and all get chances. And it won't be a bad idea to increase available governmental funds for budding new ideas in order to let the ""stand on their feet"" before turning to pharma companies to carry it on, thus allowing new ideas to florish at the beginning without the financial ""selection"" process of the private sector."	yoram chaiter	13/1/2014 9:42 PM	0	0

Ugh.  I suggest that pharma $ should be pooled to a neutral agency and distributed, like NIH $, to worthy projects---and that communication between the drug company and the researchers be strictly limited to getting a supply of the medication, if it is a new one.

182	36	1	I recently attended Evidence 2013, a conference all about evidence-based medicine in Oxford. One of the topics that kept cropping up was guidelines and how they sometimes are not as evidence-based as they should be. Sabreena has written a post about this recently  are guidelines there to be challenged? Is it too time-consuming to always challenge them? Do you have implicit faith in those who write them? How often do you challenge them? Under what circumstances?-6b981ac9bx	mbillingsley	27/3/2013 2:56 PM	0	0
183	36	1	Ifguidelines are written using gold-standard methodology and backed up by top grade evidence then it's not really about faith and you will have a hard time in a court of law explaining why you ignored them. If that is not the case then yes, of course, it would be reasonable to challenge the guideline - but only if you have evidence which is just as good or better for the alternativecourse of action you propose to take.As I have said here before professional freedom is NOT the freedom to do the wrong thing.-gnn61	skyesteve	27/3/2013 3:31 PM	0	0

188	36	1	Some guidelines are excellent and undoubtably, some guideline recommendations have saved lives.on the other hand.............Increasingly guidelines are being issued for diseases with a poor evidence base. Such guidelines are composed primarily of grade D evidence and represent only the opinions of a group of individuals invited on to a guideline panel. The recommendations may be good, but can also be seriously wrong.It is not too long ago that the British Thoracic Society Interstitial lung disease guideline gave a (weak) recommendation to triple therapy with Azathioprine, prednisolone and N-acetylcysteine. The subsequent PANTHER trial showed that this treatment was associated with a higher mortality than placebo. The experts are not always right, and there should be fewer recommendations based on Grade D evidence and more acknowledgement of uncertaintly in guidelines.I agree though, in general, guidelines are a very good thing.

If you have not used guidelines in first hand, you know what to expect and what will happen to your career!Hence, question often but it has to be always first in first hand. I don't think there is much room for being adventurous in medicine going too far away from guidelines (both fortunately and unfortunately).	Matiram Pun	29/3/2013 4:42 PM	0	0
191	36	1	It is not always necessary that the 'guidelines' are to be considered as being gold/platinum standard. In fact many of the guidelines are found to be politically/commercially influenced.

198	37	1	I think medical journals also need to take a lead.

199	37	1	Thanks Steve. All great resources, many of which we include in slides in our presentations and actively encourage students to read.I also got my hospital library to order in Bad Pharma by Ben Goldacre and asked a friend to do the same at the university medical school library.Unfortunately, many students have been so put off by dull evidence-based med talks in 1st and 2nd year that the idea of reading around the subject isn't at all appealing. I also don't know how many students do actually read all the books listed under 'compulsory reading' in their curriculum - I know I certainly didn't read every single one, there's just too much to cover.I suggest making Ben's fantastic TED talks 'compulsory watching'. I really do challenge any EBM teacher to manage to cover the amount that Ben G covers in his 15 minute TEDs, just as clearly and passionately as he does. Alternatively, they could juststart showing interesting talks/interviews like these during their lectures.I also think that in medical school ethics teaching we spend a lot of time learning about Beauchamp & Childress' 4 principles, we have debates about euthanasia, abortion, end of life care etc....but when do we learn about publication bias, research misconduct and the harmful effects of drug promotion? These tend to only be taught if there happens to be a lecturer in the university who is particularly passionate about these issues. And even then, these lecturers have to fight to get the time to teach this in an already over-loaded medical curriculum.This needs to change.Just some of my thoughts!

209	39	1	Agree with Joey- it depends on the quality of the evidence. Sometimes it isn't there and then what do you do? Even NICE accepts expert opinion is a form of evidence. But people mean different things by evidence and certainly you should start with Cochrane reviews but these will only answer a small number of questions and maybe not in your patients because trials are so selective that you will be hard pushed to find people like our patients who have co morbidities. Then the evidence often doesn't contain enough information to tell you how to do it. No doctors likes to practice cook book medicine as early opponents of EBM used to call it but as a patient I would want to know my doctor was up to date and careful. EBM Is great when it is there but it is limited in its relevance and scope still.However who is going to say they practice non evidence based medicine?	DrTS	8/9/2011 10:58 PM	0	0

Notably, we are interested in social medias role to spread reliable information to at-risk groups, but also its potential to spread misinformation. We want to explore the following areas:   How has social media been used in previous epidemics to reach at-risk groups/spread health messages? (How have health authorities and doctors used it? What have patients used it for?) Whats the psychology behind social media? Does it compel users to help each other? Recommendations on how social media be used to spread relevant information more effectivelyHow can social media be used to get different health professionals (doctors, nurses, etc) to communicate with each other and share infromation/advise patients? What are its limitations?   We will be posting on the next few months to gauge opinion and will be working with @nhssm who conduct a few Twitter chats, a blog, and scenario exercise, to explore the answers to some of these questions and find out how social media could be used by health professionals in the future to improve communication and disemminate reliable information.-0x6awib95cs07953axj	mbillingsley	20/4/2012 9:17 AM	0	0
227	43	1	I think social media is a good to way to promote ways to find information but not good ways to actually present information. I think social media in its core is actually about that. So many times people are simply posting links to curious pictures of whatever the latest justin bieber slag or funny quote instead of having the quote there on the site.Furthermore, I think social media has so much risk of being abused that it is risky that information placed on social media couldn't likewise be abused.Hence what I think social media should be used for is promotion.

229	43	1	There appears no effective & better way than the social media to communicate important healthcare related messages during epidemics.We have had a good result in the past using the social media as an effective way to mass communication.Psychologically people tend to follow mass or large scale media instructions.It is beyond any doubts that the social media be involved in mass communication programs.Also the social media, with help of the advanced communication methods can be able to achieve a good co-ordination between all the healthcare personalities.& help to share views of each other.The limitations may sometimes be concerned with lack of technically detailed knowledge.

230	44	1	Hi all, As part of our project into the use of social media during public health crises and epidemics, we're asking everyone to participate in this very short survey to say how they would act on social media during the throes of an epidemic.

231	45	1	The GMC have drafted some new guidance on how doctors should use social media. http://www.gponline.com/News/article/1128299/gmc-consults-guidance-gps-using-facebook-twitter/For me, whilst it is important to provide guidelines, I am concered that all discussion of the potential uses of social media in healthcare are being bogged down by issues to do with professionalism, reputation, confidentiality etc. Whilst I full acknowledge these are important issues, there seems to be s a lack of balance.There is a small but committed band of healthcare professionals dedicated to exploring the uses of social media in healthcare, but for me the majority of what I see discussed about doctors and social media seems to be dominated by largely bureaucratic or technical issues. Should there be more creative thinking in how we can use social media in healthcare? (E.g. public health engagement, disemmination of information for patients etc?) 'Social' media implies that it is a social tool, and perhaps doctors want to use it purely for social use, but seeing that how many people use Twitter as a news source, surely the health profession should harness it more widely?	mbillingsley	24/4/2012 5:02 PM	0	0

235	46	1	BMJ Group and doc2doc are involved in a European Commission project called TELL ME, which is looking into communication techniques used during public health crises.  TELL ME stands for Transparent communication in Epidemics: Learning Lessons from experience, delivering effective Messages, providing Evidence) and is a 36 month Collaborative Project, which aims to provide evidence and to develop models for improved risk communication during infectious disease crises. TELL ME combines public health, social sciences, behavioural sciences, political sciences, law, ethics, communication and media, in order to develop original communication strategies regarding complicated messages and advice based on uncertainties, also addressing vaccine-resistant groups You can read more about the project on the website: http://www.tellmeproject.eu/  doc2docs involvement in the project is to write a report on the use of social media during public health crises, as well as put together a guidance document for health professionals with the goal to increase vaccine uptake in at-risk groups/vaccine resistant groups, and to coordinate the publication schedule for the whole project.   Being an online community network, we would really like to get doc2doc users involved in this project, as well as non members too. Seeing that one of the reports is on social media (or new media), it seems only right that we consult online communities and draw upon your vast array of experience and knowledge, to produce a well-informed and engaging report.-n24bnop10483	mbillingsley	20/4/2012 9:14 AM	0	0

In Canada, many established doctors do not care about online reputation management because they have an overflow of patients. but wht about new doctors from around the world.

South Africa is a most violent country; colleagues who have gone there were told it was unsafe to go outside at night, never to have open car windows, or stop their car, even at a red light.

263	55	1	Depends on where you are....if you are chillaxing in a first world country, then go to a third world country......you might not want to wind up there eventually but you need to see how medicine handles the other side. Or if you are just looking for a medical experience and nothing else, then go where it is top notch eg: USA....... but if you want an overall experience of people, places and medicine, then you should go for something you've never imagined finding yourself in.   I had a choice between the UK (St. George's, UoL), Singapore (NUS) and India (CMC) and I chose India because I wanted an experience. Loved the medical bit, got traumatized/enlightened by the poverty (places and people bit) bit.....if I could do it all over again, I'd still choose it.

264	55	1	ThanksJohn, Maxim, Poltor, Oddyseus and KK Muneer!! Awesome perspectives.   Basically, I would love to experience medicine in a different country! Though of Pakistani decent myself, hardly been to pakistan! Let alone experienced medicine there so thought it would be a good idea to reconnect and see what it's like there.

I have had several students who have have felt low or scared and 1 student who I think was depressed. Most of the time a listening ear is enough but it would have been nice to offer these students more from the university so that they felt more supported. In the end I did what I could but had to ask them to see their own GP and asked if them if I could discuss the issues with the med school. In the case of the student who was depressed the med school were supportive but could not offer very much.I wish there was more support available.-er	charlie	29/10/2012 1:49 PM	0	0
274	58	1	After coming across this blog I had to register and comment on this. I can relate to this in more ways than I can explain. My years as an undergraduate were almost never-ending and on the brink of breakdown I found the support of a very helpful councillor at my university. She helped me et through the last two years where i felt i could no longer continue and quit.   Looking back i am unable to imagine i would ever be where i am today, having travelled various international countries, done humanitarian work after working for the NHS for a decade I finally decided to come back to the UK and start fresh. I now have a great job as an online doctor doing remote prescriptions for a UK based online doctori earn well and live a easy life with hours to suit me.   I also volunteer at my old university to mentor some students and feels great to give back to the community. my best advice for people in such circumstances is to find a mentor you can relate to, use the services available around your university, those people are really there to help and firmly believe that it gets better, if i can survive and end up in a happy comfortable job then i am sure everyone else can.

275	58	1	Welcome Dr.Felix!  Thank you for contributing on such a sensitive topic!   I hope I wasn't lucky as a student, first to never suffer from depression and then to be at a school where we were expected to register with the school's own GP, who then adressed us more than once on the problems of the student.  He (for in those days it was a he) said that mental problems were not likely but that he and his staff were there to help. If I had had a problem, I would have felt confident is asking for that.  I hope that other schools today are as positive.   For doctors in general, and at all stages of their careers are as likely to have mental problems as any group, and to be as vulnerable to the stress of the job.  Today we are becoming more willing to admit it.  Personal stories of encounters with psychiatry appear more and more often in the medical press.  In Anaesthesia News this month (June 2015) , Dr.Zoe Turner of the Mersey Deanery couragously wrote about her own post-natal depression, and her difficulty in admitting to herself that she was depressed, and not 'just tired'.  Hers was a dangerous and ultimately successful journey, that as yet is not available online athttp://www.aagbi.org/publications/anaesthesia_news/2015 but no doubt will be soon.

276	58	1	As someone who convenes a medical school course, I can say that a massive part of what we do is support students in difficulty, and difficult students. 10% of our student cohort will have a mental or physical health problem over the 5 years. We have many students have enduring mental illness, some quite severe.       A question that we face a lot is whether students are falling out of the course because they can't cope with their mental illness, or whether the medical course is making their mental illness worse. We must not discriminate against students with mental illness, but sometimes there comes a point where putting students back into a high pressure environment is not in their best interests. This happens infrequently.   The majority of students with mental health issues require some time, support, and compassion, and they make it through.-2swse7cd6r8	DundeeChest	17/6/2015 2:34 PM	0	0
277	58	1	I am a GP in Dublin with a big interest in nutrient therapy in mental health.   In the last few years two doctors from UK have come to see me for depression.   They told me that being a student with depression was very difficult with little support and the psychiatrists kept trying different meds to little effect. Both got psychotherpy and it helped .Both of them had been in hospital at some stage.   I did not change their medication. Biochemically one was severely undermethylated which is a marker for severe depression and often OCD, which she actually has. She has since been reduced from paroxetine 60 mg to 20 mg and is functioning well. She has got her membership and is now a consultant.   The other one was not as bad and after extensive testing I found that she had a pyrrole disorder. That is a byproduct in making red blood cells and if it is high and does not pass out in the urine it causes severe psychiatic problems,including schizophrenia. The treatment is very easy with zinc, Vit B6 and some other individualised nutrients and she got well in a matter of weeks. She was already a consultant when she came here but had been out of work for months. Within weeks she was back at work and does not need any medication. She came to see me since and was quite joyful. She also referred a patient to me.   Female doctors have about 6 times the risk of suicide as other women. I am quite sure that if their biochemistry was normalised that many of them would be well. The general public would also benefit from this type of therapy. Courses are recently available in USA - see details at www.walshinstiture.org .

279	59	1	An article published in this months Student BMJ outlines how it has been raised by the future forum (a consultation group for the NHS) that finals should bestandardised across all UK medical schools. This has been raised because there are concerns ofthe preparedness of graduates and an inconsistency in the competency in graduates entering foundation training. The article also outlines how apparently the National Training Survey published in 2011 by the GMC showed that 24% of foundation year doctors did not feel adequately prepared for their first job.I wonder why this issue has come about. It seems ludicrous to think that medical students are not being assessed to the same degree in their final exam as the whole point of the GMC guidelines is so that this type of concern does not raise its head. The whole point of Tomorrows Doctors is to make sure that all graduates are equipped with the same skills in the same way. Howarethe finals all of a sudden causing this?The point being raised about 24% of new F1s not feeling prepared I believe has nothing to do with how they are tested for their finals. Surely confidence is acquired not throught the sitting of exams but through the practice of clinical skills on willing patients?I do not think that by simply making the final paper the same for all medical schools is somehow going to make them feel either more confident or more like doctors. Creating an exam such as the one suggested by the Future Forum is allied to the idea of there only being one exam board that is allowed to set GCSEs or A levels instead of the current system of OCRandEdexcel etc. Thatidea I likewisebelieveto be foolish. What is everyones opinion on this matter?? Would a one exam system be better?Here is the link to the article: http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.e600-s71cwds9ad08ddrp	NCantley	29/10/2012 1:48 PM	0	0

I can see that medicine is a university degree and you don't have standard ones for law or classics but medicine you would assume is something all graduates should be measured on in a uniform way. Why couldn't the colleges come up with something? I don't know if there is a problem that needs solving eg is there much of a difference between Bristol and Southampton's finals papers.

After graduateing we only have provisional registration from the GMC, we can't achieve full registration unless we achieve all our FY1 compentancies, which are set nationally.The trouble with a national exam is then medical schools start teaching to the exam, and start to loose their individuility.	ross71521	29/10/2012 1:48 PM	0	0
285	59	1	Having the same exam would involve a degree of cooperation on scheduling which would be almost impossible. In essence, you're asking 32 institutions to provide a suitable room at the same time for each component of the assessment. We find it hard enough to get enough rooms as it is (and remember the separate rooms for the specilal cases students).	Pat Harkin	22/5/2015 4:13 PM	0	0
286	59	1	I agree with NCantley; it's difficult to see how any final exam could improve the preparedness of medical graduates. That comes about through sustained training and education that better reflects what a new doctor needs to be able to do. Simulation has been a valuable adjunct but competence, which is such astrangely popular concept, does not predict well how someone will perform in the real world. That requires more experience with real patients in real settings.   Some experience, that is too often optional, should be mandatory, in particular enough experience of dealing with acute problems at night. It's also worrying how many students can come to graduation never havinghad direct experience of dealing with all the procedures surrounding a death.That also includes the need to declare to HMRCall income from cremation forms. Every few years many doctors continue to have to learn this lesson the hard and expensive way!-ppy5f1c2qrc0d2b6	Maxim	22/5/2015 5:32 PM	0	0
287	59	1	I had always understood that the GMC used to set the MINIMUM standard of what should be taught, and let the Medical Schools get on with it as long as the standard was met.   There also used to be a parallel qualification (LRCP, MRCS) set by the Royal Colleges of Surgery and Medicine the 'Conjoint Board' the examiners for which were, in the main, the examiners of the various medical schools. The exam standard was therefore pretty comparable.   Many students did both the degree and Conjoint, but some who had dropped out from the degrees coulod still qualify via the Conjoint exams. The main differences were that Conjoint was more highly geared to practical medicine, and one could sit final examinations individually instead of all together - i.e. Medicine, Surgery, Ob/Gyn.   The Conjoint system ceased about 1985 (I think - open to correction there) and eventuially the MRCS was hijacked into replacing the FRCS as the higher qualification in surgery, parallelling the MRCP.   --8p0	Poltor	29/5/2015 1:54 PM	0	0
288	60	1	I will be returning to fourth year of a UK medical school after having taken the year out to deal with some personal struggles with depression, in which I lived abroad and distanced myself from anything medically-related. Prior to that year, I did an intercalation in Medical Humanities (studying medicine in literature and philosophy), so basically have not been exposed to science-y, clinical medicine for two years!   I was just wondering if anyone had been in a similar position of dealing with a transition back into medical school after a significant break, and what advice people could give on re-familiarising oneself with the sheer enormity of the content we are expected to know? Is there a way to revise or prepare for going back into Hospitals without actually being allowed to go on a hospital placement until I am re-enrolled and term has already started?	Taliaeilon	13/5/2015 2:02 PM	2	0
289	60	1	Firstly well done for recognising the need to occasionally take time off for personal issues and well done for returning!   I took a year out in the middle of year 4 to have my first child. I told myself all sorts of great things about how I was going to use maternity leave to get some extra reading done etc. Funnily enough I found I was otherwise occupied! I returned to a not too busy firm so I had an ease in period of about 4 weeks and it was necessary.   My advice, don't panic. You are still a student and you will be surprised how much you will remember and how much you can pick up with some proper application. If you can, go into any hospital and explain your situation- maybe they might let you follow a Dr around just to remember what a prescription chart looks like! If you aren't allowed into a hospital yet concentrate on the book side. Get some of online question banks: passmedicine, passtest etc and practice getting back into that medical reasoning mindset.   Once you get back don't beat yourself up if you aren't instantly as sharp as you used to be. Find a good, fair, friendly, knowledgeable mentor in your firm (student or Dr) to stick to like glue until you get your confidence back.   Good luck!-hm6ap	Drob	18/5/2015 3:36 PM	0	0
290	61	1	"Q: How do most students hear about extra curricular events going on that they are interested?  A: It would appear that most people hear about events via word of mouth, through social media or via mailing lists that they are signed up to.  Q: How do most students find out about conferences that they can attend or present at?  A: Mainly via their supervisors, word of mouth from like minded colleagues, mailing lists of certain organisations advertising their own conferences or via trawling Google. Two of the relatively major conference databases can be found below:  http://www.medical.theconferencewebsite.com/medical-conferences-2015  http://www.globaleventslist.elsevier.com/events/#/filterYears=2015&disciplineIds=&specialtyIds=&continentCodes=&countryCodes=   QuID is an organisation founded by students for students and we were wondering if there might be a better/ easier way for other students to find out about events - big and small.   The first step we have made to try and encourage more medical students to work togethe is to create a ""hub"" of contact details for medical school societies across the UK. Using this list you should be able to contact students at almost every single medical school relatively easily:  http://www.quid.org.uk/resources/collaboration   So if you want to organise or advertise events then you can send an email via these contact details. We would also be really happy to add your society to this list.   Our next plan is to build a ""free, open access"" events calendar for academic medical events - workshops, lectures, conferences etc so that it is eaier to advertise your events to a wider cohort of students and doctors. The link to explaining how to access this calendar is below:  http://www.quid.org.uk/all-ongoing-projects/on-going-projects/item/60-academic-medicine-events-hub-calendar-in-development   The link to the current calendar can be found here:  http://www.quid.org.uk/resources/events/month.calendar/2015/05/17/-   We hope that you find these resources useful.

298	63	1	Im afraid that what the blog idea suits best is literature, art, or other relevant issues which are of a general nature and (by nature) subjective. Art or general views can be expressed orally or on paper by almost anyone with honourable intentions.  But in the case of science one must speak lying on evidence or some kind of logic or at least following a logical algorithm. This is very dubious as to who can do it. Yet, not every scientific discovery in history is the result of evidence. Brilliant, innovative and radical minds appear from time to time, though scarcely one must admit, and they subvert the norms and the scientific canonical dogmatism of their time. Such minds could post their ideas in blogs and something could then come out of this. But the vast majority of scientists arent this kind of minds. Moreover there is a high possibility all these blog posts became a sort of Babel Tower and collapse instantly into sheer nothingness. Scientists and investigators must have a lodestar to commence or sustain their journey and this lodestar, or compass, or whatever has to hold principles and rules and this can be done only by journals and societies at least for now.-rg5avh0nz42414a3wam1girhk8csjzylj7cx38cp	panossim	29/10/2012 2:02 PM	0	0

This is only possible if we can find common ground beyond our personal gains and achievement. There is a tendency to submit articles to the big ones first and then to turn to the 'lesser' ones only if rejected.

305	65	1	One person was sexually harassed in his child hood, and as he remembers he was having some symptoms of STD (Syphilis) at that time. After some time, these symptoms disappeared and then he used to suffer from stomach disorder, unusual skin spots, pain in body, joints, headache, sleeplessness, too much sweating, hair loss in patches, vision problem, hearing problem and other problems. But at that time nobody could understand this disease. Now he is 50 years old and now these problems are increasing day by day. He has children and they are also showing the different symptoms. The person contacted Skin department of different hospitals including AIIMS, New Delhi and other private doctors, but could not get satisfied. He says that he is suffering from the latent stage of STD and children are showing teeth disorder, skin spots which very much resemble with the syphilis symptoms. But nobody is ready to treat this family.  I want to ask the doctors that whether syphilis at the late stage is treatable or not. If it can be treated, please save the life of six seven persons. I request to Sri Amir Khan, as he is taking the social problems. I hope at least he may come ahead. There are so many persons who are suffering with such problems but they are not able to diagnose it there selves. But I am sure that is this is late syphilis. Please help.	VD1	30/7/2013 11:23 AM	0	0
306	65	1	Even late Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics such as penicillin, G benzathine, doxycycline, or tetracycline (for patients who are allergic to penicillin). Length of treatment depends on the extent of the infection and factors such as the person's overall health. Care needs to be taken at the start of treatment as there may be a Herxheimer reaction.	doctorg	30/7/2013 3:05 PM	0	0

310	66	1	While we ponder here over exerciseand its benefit to our health,a recent paper from Myoclinic reportsthat there is link between aerobic capacity and cerebrovascular reactivity among healthy older adults i.e. in a healthy aging, if you have been doing regular exercise and maintaining your aerobic fitness; brain blood flow reactivity (in response to increased carbon dioxide) is preserved. The vasodilator response is also preserved. And it seems it is mediated with cyclooxygenase pathway (as they used Indomethacin intervention here).Hence, exercise is better.....keep moving!Link for the article:http://jap.physiology.org/content/early/2013/03/04/japplphysiol.01258.2012.abstract-p4r4a1bz7	Matiram Pun	28/3/2013 5:58 PM	0	0

But we keep on losing those redundant overlappings as we age. Hence, we will have to work hard to keep the remaining systems healthy and intact.With the drugs and intervention, if we perturb these remaining systems; we tend to show the pathophysiological effects ..?-3y	Matiram Pun	26/5/2013 9:08 PM	0	0

315	67	1	Obviously, atheletes and anyone involved in endurance sports are highly prone to injuries, inflammation and pain. The pain killers are common in use. To go further, there are many pain killers available over-the-counter.The physiology of pain killing in sports especially effects of Cyclooxygenase inhibition goes on (inhibit or not to inhibit).HereBMJ_Open (congratulations opening this Open item) has published one such study. The focus has been : Cardiovascular, Renal and Gastrointestinal effects!=================AbstractObjectivesTo prevent pain inhibiting their performance, many athletes ingest over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics before competing. We aimed at defining the use of analgesics and the relation between OTC analgesic use/dose and adverse events (AEs) during and after the race, a relation that has not been investigated to date.DesignProspective (non-interventional) cohort study, using an online questionnaire.SettingThe Bonn marathon 2010.Participants3913 of 7048 participants in the Bonn marathon 2010 returned their questionnaires.Primary and secondary outcomesIntensity of analgesic consumption before sports; incidence of AEs in the cohort of analgesic users as compared to non-users.ResultsThere was no significant difference between the premature race withdrawal rate in the analgesics cohort and the cohort who did not take analgesics (controls). However, race withdrawal because of gastrointestinal AEs was significantly more frequent in the analgesics cohort than in the control. Conversely, withdrawal because of muscle cramps was rare, but it was significantly more frequent in controls. The analgesics cohort had an almost 5 times higher incidence of AEs (overall risk difference of 13%). This incidence increased significantly with increasing analgesic dose. Nine respondents reported temporary hospital admittance: three for temporary kidney failure (post-ibuprofen ingestion), four with bleeds (post-aspirin ingestion) and two cardiac infarctions (post-aspirin ingestion). None of the control reported hospital admittance.ConclusionsThe use of analgesics before participating in endurance sports may cause many potentially serious, unwanted AEs that increase with increasing analgesic dose. Analgesic use before endurance sports appears to pose an unrecognised medical problem as yet. If verifiable in other endurance sports, it requires the attention of physicians and regulatory authorities.=================http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/4/e002090.fullWhen I discussed with one of the researcher long ago, he mentioned pain killers are used like popcorns!There is cautionary tail.....it is important that we look all aspects in their uses for different age groups and purposes.-3l5ezgsm0c9a9h1fr2bol337196eiic	Matiram Pun	26/5/2013 8:38 PM	0	0

Alternative view of congestive heart failure exacerbations: Role of lymphatic function and inflammation. OA Medical Hypothesis 2013 May 01;1(1):6These two articles are available as a provisional PDF file at the following open access website.http://www.oapublishinglondon.com/oa-medical-hypothesisIntroduction: Lymphatic function and inflammation are two related concepts that have been neglected in heart failure. All of the symptoms of heart failure, hence, compensatory mechanisms can be related to overwhelmed or dysfunctional lymphatic function. Lymphatics are responsible for tissue homeostasis controlling approximately 12 liters of fluid. These thin walled valved pumping systems are also intimately involved in immunity and control of inflammation. Lipid and nutritional transport; and repair of damaged tissues by cellular transport round out its many function. The Hypothesis: Inflammation is the cause of decompensated heart failure and lymphatics and their reaction to environment are the primary mediators. This concept is consistent with a new model of disease - regeneration balanced by degeneration with inflammation (lymphatic function) serving as the fulcrum.Adapted from with permission Houck PD, de Oliveira JMF. Applying laws of biology to diabetes with emphasis on metabolic syndrome. Med Hypotheses (2013) Http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2012.11.019CONCLUSION The Lymphatic system is an unexplored fine vascular network involved in interstitial homeostasis and inflammation. This network helps to relieve symptoms of heart failure mainly edema and dyspnea. The system is directly linked to inflammation which is responsible for protection from the environment and for repair. Lymphangiontrope is a new term that characterizes lymphatic pumping function. Medication that improves lymphangiontrope will help relieve symptoms of heart failure. Current therapies should be re-evaluated to understand the influence of interventions on lymphangiontrope. This concept is especially important considering that current therapy of preload reduction is associated with increased mortality. New therapies that influence lymphatics will likely be chemical drugs, mechanical stimulants, electrical stimulants, biologicals, and cellular treatments. These therapies will also influence inflammation and regeneration and remodeling of the heart.Introduction: Diseases are in constant evolution and new diseases spring into our world. The changes can be subtle and often overlooked. The article Alternative View of Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbations Role of Lymphatic Function and Inflammation examines the lymphatic system. This article implies that heart failure exacerbations frequently occur due to an adverse perturbation of the periphery as opposed to the decline of central cardiac function. Hypothesis: Heart failure is evolving due to environmental factors that affect the periphery. Our patients have evolved into a larger species suffering from obstructed sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, recalcitrant hypertension, and inflammation. Right heart failure has become a more common presentation of heart failure.

They describe the targets of therapy as central and peripheral which is a new concept in heart failure management. The approach has to be molded to the individual and as the individual changes; the approach has to be adjusted. I am crotchety because it will be 15 to 20 years before they become guidelines; and by that time, heart failure will have evolved into something else. I am crotchety because I want to know the effect of heart failure medication on circulating stem cells, inflammation, and lymphatic function a powerful mediator of peripheral compensation.Read the articles and see if your perspective on heart failure changes.

319	70	1	"MBillingsley brought to my attention today an article from Emergency Medicine Journal on the use of distraction therapy in medicine. http://emj.bmj.com/content/early/2013/04/19/emermed-2013-202337.short?g=w_emj_ahead_tab  Distraction therapy is nothing new but over the years, as trends change in popular culture the toys involved can change. Teddy bears and bubbles are permanent favourites, but toys such as TellyTubbies have fallen in & then out of favour with children.   This Irish study uses the well established tool of a hospital examination glove, inflated & tied as an improved balloon. In their prospective trial they offered children the gloves in the form of Jedward (using all 5 fingers as the distinctive Jedward hair style) or the Mohawk (where the thumb represents the nose & fingers the hair). Their observation was that only 13 of the 149 children were no interested in playing with either glove style, but that 55% preferred the ""Jedward"" and 45% the ""Mohawk"".  I do wonder if the results would be the same in the UK or USA, or if the Mohawk would have been more popular in the era of Mr.T and the A-Team? Does this study change the way we practice, or bring new ideas to clinical practice? regrettably no, but its nice to read a light hearted study making its way into clinical practice."

320	71	1	Hi everyone One idea which I have been mulling over a while is to host a BMJ Twitter chat each week, which would be based on BMJ content - or other journal content. There are already many healthcare Twitter journal clubs about (http://www.symplur.com/healthcare-hashtags/tweet-chats/) so we would need to be distinct in what we were offering our followers. DrS has written about Guerilla medical education and the role of Twitter - which showed the value of impromptu clinical Twitter discussions. We think this is a great way to initiate discussion and engage the wider medical community.We would like to take this idea forward and would welcome your thoughts on which papers we should cover and how we could distinguish ourselves from other chats.	mbillingsley	15/1/2013 2:15 PM	0	0

There is irrefutable evidence that high salt diet (sodium/sodium chloride) increases blood pressure.This week BMJ has published a meta-analysis on longer term modest reduction on salt intake and its effect on blood pressure....entitled ""Effect of longer term modest salt reduction on blood pressure: Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials""The gist of the study:=============================What is already known on this topicA modest reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure and thereby reduces cardiovascular riskA recent meta-analysis of salt reduction trials implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids, which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with the reduction in blood pressure. This meta-analysis, however, included a large number of trials with a large change in salt intake for only a few days, which are irrelevant to the current public health recommendations for a modest reduction in salt intake for a long period of timeWhat this study addsA longer term modest reduction in salt intake leads to significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic groupWith salt reduction, there is a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and noradrenaline and no significant change in lipid concentrationsThere is a dose-response relation between the reduction in salt intake and the fall in systolic blood pressure. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9-12 to 5-6 g/day will have a major effect but a further reduction to 3 g/day will have a greater effect=============================It is noted that Salt intake in fact is in increasing trend....for sure it is not decreasing especially when it is added in many food items.

335	76	1	The correct answer is thyroid function.  Explanation:  Amiodarone is a drug which is used to control a variety of cardiac dysrhythmias including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias and atrial fibrillation.  Its use is limited by its significant side effect profile, predominantly hepatic dysfunction and drug-associated hepatitis (for which baseline and regular liver function should be assessed) and respiratory complications including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. For this reason, a baseline chest x ray should be carried out and this should be repeated at least annually to ensure no deterioration.  If the patient experiences respiratory symptoms they should be investigated promptly with plain films initially and further investigated with high resolution CT scanning of the chest and pulmonary function testing including diffusion studies. Baseline pulmonary function testing is not mandatory prior to starting treatment and there is no benefit in regular assessment of the peak expiratory flow rate. Discontinuation of the drug when respiratory symptoms occur is advisable as pulmonary fibrosis is often not reversible and stopping the drug may prevent further deterioration in function.  Amiodarone also has the potential to cause some significant eye-related side effects including the deposition of corneal microdeposits which can impair visual acuity and may cause night-time glare and significantly reduce a patient's ability to drive. This is called whorl keratopathy and often is reversible on cessation of the drug. Approximately 10% of patients taking amiodarone complain of some form of visual discolouration, predominantly a bluish tinge to vision. Other visual manifestations have also been reported including optic atrophy, non-ischaemic neuritis, papilloedema and various visual field defects, none of which are dosage dependent and are occasionally partly reversible on cessation of the drug. It is not necessary to establish baseline visual acuity or fields prior to starting treatment.  Amiodarone is also occasionally indicted in the development of a peripheral neuropathy with decreased peripheral sensation and also occasionally with tremor. There is no need to perform nerve conduction studies prior to starting therapy and rarely is it needed during therapy if symptoms develop.  Amiodarone is an iodine-containing drug very similar in chemical structure to thyroxine. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism have been reported in many patients taking this drug, although this is often subclinical and detected on biochemical monitoring. It is very important to establish a baseline thyroid profile prior to starting treatment and often amiodarone is avoided in those with thyroid dysfunction. Usually measurement of both free thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) are monitored, as well as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) as T4 estimation alone is not sufficient to detect dysfunction.

336	77	1	A 23-year-old man was attacked with a knife and sustained a 4 cm laceration across his right thenar eminence. He says his index finger feels numb.  A photograph of his hand is shown below.	OnExamination	1/6/2015 1:34 PM	0	0
337	77	1	The correct answer is: Flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus  Explanation:  Inspection forms a crucial part of hand examination and the finger cascade is an important part of evaluating the hand.  At rest, with the hand palm up, the fingers are flexed, with increasing flexion from the index to little fingers. This is due to the flexor being stronger than the extensors; hence, at rest the fingers assume a flexed position.  In the photograph the patient's index finger is held in extension. Therefore he has almost certainly damaged both flexors (flexor digitorum superficialis, and profundus) to his index finger.  Extensor indicis and flexor pollicis brevis are incorrect as zone of injury does not affect the thumb or extensor region.  There is no flexion at all in the index finger; therefore both flexors are likely ruptured.  Try more med school finals sample questions here	OnExamination	22/6/2015 2:11 PM	0	0

350	80	1	I suppose the answer has to be anti spasmotic. But, it would not be my drug of choice. I think that UK GPs do not write a lot of prescriptions for hyoscine. We might write more for 'buscopan' [scopolamine butyl bromide]. I would not want to write hyoscine if the was any risk of pregnancy. I doubt that it would have any more benefit than a placebo in the brief case outlined in the question.-5kk8	Pat Lush	24/5/2015 10:13 PM	0	0
351	80	1	The correct answer is antispasmodic.  Hyoscine butylbromide exerts an antispasmodic action on the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal, biliary and genito-urinary tracts.  As a quaternary ammonium derivative, hyoscine butylbromide does not enter the central nervous system. Therefore, anticholinergic side effects at the central nervous system do not occur. Peripheral anticholinergic action results from a ganglion-blocking action within the visceral wall as well as from antimuscarinic activity. It therefore may have a role to play in the treatment of menstrual cramps which have not responded to conventional pain relieving medication.  NSAIDs are inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. It was thought that inhibitors of COX-2 only would provide pain relief without a risk of GI bleeding. In fact they were withdrawn due to increased cardiovascular events in patients who used them.  Codeine is an example of an opiate receptor agonist that can be added in to other pain relieving medication classes.

Posted by Pat Lush    Is this a joke? I think you might want to read your BNF.. Scopolamine is the old fashioned term for hyoscine. Both refer to the same drug.

354	81	1	hi eli,i think it was around 2 weeks before finals that i finally summoned up the courage to ask our tutor in front my peers, how to read ecgs! iwas sorely disappointed with the answer - i thought i would be told that you can learn to look at an ecg in a particular way and the answer will jump out at you like a magic eye picture. i think you eventually get to that stage of pattern recognition when you've seen hundreds of them, but until then, we just have to be systematic about it. this is especially true in clinical exams, as you want to demonstrate that you have a logical thought process. so the only thing i can recommend is look at as many real ecgs as you can with a copy of 'the ecg made easy' by your side! do it with your friends too, and present to each other. if you do enough, you may surprise yourself by uncannily describing funny rhythms in a very logical way.a-qg	Adam Asghar	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0

371	85	1	I've worked with some of the leading providers of support and education for doctors doing exams. Most doctors and medical students find that doing as many questions as possible and being able to track your performance so you know your weaker areas really helps. have a look at http://www.onexamination.com/	Simon Admin	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0

373	85	1	I'd agree with the above posts, questions are useful but each medical school has a different structure to their exams, so make sure you know what to expect. You might have some lecture notes which are specific for what you are expected to know, so make sure you know the content of these. Also, look at your syllabus/logbooks to see which areas you are expected to know about.Also, as well as bookwork and questions, make sure you do not neglect the clinical side. Most exams have OSCEs or equivalent practical exams, so make sure you practice clinical examinations with your friends and on the wards; this can also help to break up the monotony of revising by yourself.Try not to be put off by how much others are working or claiming to be working. Everyone revises in different ways and the last thing you need is other people stressing out.And most of all, take time out for yourself! Good luck!	GreenGirl	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
374	85	1	It's so easy to get worked up about exams and drive yourself into the ground. Medics are terrible at making each other feel guilty about the amount of work they and doing. I would say:Set yourself realistic goals,practice past exam questions,take regular breaks - working solid for 6 hours is a waste of time, 3 1hour bursts are much more effective.work with friends and explain stuff to each other - verbalising ingrains stuff into the memorydraw pictures and stick post it notes all over the houseAnd do fun stuff in between, the best advise someone gave me was to 'pencil in' a fun day - where you forget about finals, spend time doing what you want to do etc. that way you don't burn out.good luck......!	ijoshi1	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0

376	85	1	Are your finals wrirtten or clinical as well? In Bristol we had written one year and practical the next.Looking back the clinical one was not too impressive but they want you to come across as sensible and safe, to work through things methodically, rather than being brilliant at coming up with a rare diagnosis and being unable to look the patient or examiners in the eye. Make sure you know the things that you should be expected to know, not the rare stuff.	luisad	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
377	85	1	I would say on the clinical/OSCE front, doing the really basic things well is well worth it. That isnt meant to seem patronizing, its just that in an artificial, stressful exam scenario it is very easy to forget and miss easy marks. You can usually get hold of old marking schemes to see what these are for your universitys exams.Off the top of my head for example, remember to wash your hands at the start and end of examining anyone  this also gives you time to plan what you are going to do, or what examination findings you are about to present. We got marks for introducing ourselves and making sure the patient understood our role and consented to the history/examination were did.  It doesnt really matter if you get the diagnosis right at the end as long as you present what you found honesty and clearly. Lastly, I would say look smart and make sure you smile when you walk in and greet the patients/actors/examiners  Im sure that makes them want to help you more.

378	85	1	"I'd agree with most of whats been said above.excercise, fun time and keeping in touch with friends is all important. Sometimes you can find fun aids to revision - theres a forum somewhere around on here which has loads of good suggestions. ""less mind numbing learning""http://doc2doc.bmj.com/forums.html?slGroupKey=35e72c33-95b9-4d95-8cfa-89e2dc6d6b9dOther things to suggest as far as answers go is ensuring you are safe. For example in a radiology station they want to know 2 things - do you know whats on the film, and do you understand based on that what need to be done next. For example: CXR shows air under the diaphragm - describe what you see, thisis likely due to a perforated viscus in the abdomen - then follow up with - I'd like to review this patient using ABC, make them NBMand contact the surgeons. Wrist XR shows colles fracture - describe it, then ""I'd like to examine the patient to ensure distal neurovascular in tact, obtain films of the joint above and below, and contact the orthopods.Good luck everybody-1l1a9bw"	DrS	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0

382	86	1	I always found the Vivas more stressful than the Writtens, and the best advice I was given was to remember that the examiners WANT you to pass!They have been there too, and understand nervousness. If you don't know the answer, say so, and they will ask you another. Repeated 'passes' won't pass you, but time wasted on ums and ers lose you the opportunity to gain points that will.Do your exams still have essay answers? If so then spend some of your precious time planning the answers to all the questions before you start to write. Bullet points or paragraph headings listed first on the back of the paper. You can add to them as points come to mind while you answer the rest. In a three hour exam. ten to twenty minutes spent in this way is a good investment.John-4gu9ctia7i7ca4	John D	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0

White   This is the final leg of the race and if you are as observant as you ought to be, you will notice medics revealing all kinds of colors under the stress; the panic, the fear, the excitement, the gunner attitudes, the sudden social withdrawal etc. Whatever works for them. I only have one tip regarding this: stay away from medics who just enjoy psyching people up. Dont pay attention to his/her monologue about how s/he finished the Big Davidsons 5 times and is now reading it for the 6th time just out of boredom! Different people have different approaches and finishing something 6 times while you are still chapters away from your adequately neurotic shot does not mean anything if you cannot deliver or are not reading the relevant stuff. I am not sure why they like to advertise their study plans but it really does freak out a stressed out medic. Best you can do for yourself is walk away.

This the final year, you dont want to add any more to the drama that medschool already is. Be mellow, do your thing, all the fun/partying (if any)/feuds etc are over and done with. Its remarkable how these trivial things are forgotten in light of the Beast (aka, the final MDs/MBBS) lol. So yeah, you might be tempted to challenge the medic who claims to have finished loads, but just-bite-the-inside-of-your-cheek and walk away. Besides, you dont want to graduate with ill feelings; deep down, you know you wish everybody well =). Just dont get in a pickle of any kind!-49s920277a9a1etixkn	KK Muneer	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0

You will be revising a LOT and if you are like me, you will need to eat something every now and then. So ensure, in your free time, that your fridge is stocked with stuff that does not make you nauseated. Make sure it a compromise between healthy and filling (you dont want to be eating every other hour! Thats distracting!). I am not advocating for junk but you need to find stuff thats good enough for you to eat under any kind of stress. Dont experiment with restaurant food you never tried before.

394	87	1	I like nonsense; it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope. Which is what I do, and that enables you to laugh at life's realities.  Dr. Seuss   Breaks  do the routine; laundry, making up your bed, go for a 10 minute walk with your ipod.but stay away from doing things that zap your energy/distracts you into wasting hours no matter how enticing eg: surfing the net (for me it was doc2doc, so I had to extract myself from it with superhuman effort), listening to music (also a weakness of mine but I managed to replace Katy Perry and Pink with amazing Dolphin Meditation music and clips that truly worked out well). Try to squeeze in 10 minutes of exercise during your breaks. If you prefer a change in environment, get in touch with nature. Stick to the safe exercises. Nothings worse than studying in actual physical pain.-2kyu89342bqbfap2	KK Muneer	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
395	87	1	All successful people, men and women are big dreamers. They imagine what their future could be, ideal in every respect, and then they work every day towards their distant vision, that goal or purpose.  Brian Tracy   Dont let the other medics interrupt you; strange how much time that takes! Put up notices outside your door and stick to your guns. I ignored all knocks except those of a close friend. I like to study by myself and so people eventually stopped annoying me. But a good and rather generous medic friend of mine was distracted to smithereens with other medics walking in and out of her room for the simplest of things. It took her hours to finish something that she could have finished in half the time. Be firm, this is your life, you need to help yourself first before you can truly help others (unless of course, study groups are your thing!)this brings me to the next tip which is.-dxx02az9625uldkae	KK Muneer	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
396	87	1	Experience comprises illusions lost, rather than wisdom gained.  Joseph Roux   Dont try something radical in your final year. By now you know what works for you and what doesnt. Time is of the essence so dont suddenly decide to study by yourself if you have never done it or do groups with random eager medics if youve always managed well on your own. If there was any one time to get truly selfish, well, that moment is the final year! For clinicals though, it is all about the practice. I chose the late hours of the night and the early morning hours to work through the systems with a friend. You can only be good in that department if youve been regular (sadly a lot of medics tend to disappear to study during clinic hours). Practice consultation skills, practice the systems, practice how to approach certain patients and how you interact with them. Learn > see > do. And then time yourself. In some stations, your facial expression and body language makes a lot of difference, so practice dealing with those situations (angry patients, breaking bad news). This way you will be less nervous, remember the steps and be able to wrap it up in the allocated time. Examiners seem to like individuals who can hold it together (or at least cover the important stuff) in the time they are allocated.-877aw2b930483axca6a3i6	KK Muneer	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
397	87	1	Faith is a passionate intuition.  William Wordsworth   If you believe in something bigger than yourself, i.e God, Id recommend getting in touch. Therere a lot of moving parts to the finals with overseas examiners/your future employers with their own set of quirks that you know not, crazy OSCEs etc. There will always be something you never imagined seeing or even heard of, circumstances that you could not have predicted and this is where God comes in. Surrender yourself to the unexpected, and get on with it knowing that you have done what you could and that youve prepared and the rest is a great big mystery. Of course, if you dont believe in faith, then thats ok as long as you are comfortable with that and have found refuge and solace in other ways =)-l6t495227a9a59akc3	KK Muneer	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
398	87	1	Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.  Norman Vincent Peale   I think by the time it is D day, you need to relax, have a good breakfast, get into the hall, give it all youve got and then walk out without waiting to discuss anything. People tend to stress each other out discussing their answer choices, robbing themselves of time and energy to revise for their next exam. Make a resolution to not think about your last paper. If you can stop there, good on you, but if you feel that urge to know, then keep a day after the entire MDs are over to freak out/break down/find out etc. Chances are, when the time comes around to bawl your eyes out, you might find yourself wondering why you were worried in the first place! Sometimes you might think you did not do what you couldve but maybe you did. You cannot take your emotions seriously in this time of stress. You will literally be on autopilot, hopping from exam to exam! So why bother worrying about whats done, signed, sealed and soon to be delivered? Think about it.-7x3a844176bira1	KK Muneer	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
399	87	1	Expect problems and eat them for breakfast.  Alfred A. Montapert   Endurance: the medschool finals will push you to your perceived limit and then beyond. You need to learn to break it down into small pieces and get through it. If your exams are like a marathon of 19 or so series of theory, OSCE, Vivas and Clinicals over a really short period of time, you need to endure it with some grace and balance. You will get tired, mentally exhausted, feel the pain of stretching yourself and fighting so hard than you have ever before.but know this, millions did it before you and millions more will do it after you and most importantly your fellow medics are going through it WITH YOU AT THAT VERY MOMENT. So this means you are not alone and take it from me, it might feel like you will pass out any second but you wont if you took care of yourself first as a person and then as a student. You'd be surprised by just how much you can handle. You also need to love yourself and give yourself time to rest. You need to acknowledge your weaknesses and drawbacks under the stress and then move on. At this time, work smarter, not harder. And you know yourself best! Tell yourself that youve come this far, it must mean something; your doctors trust you and so the question is: do you believe in yourself as much as the world believes in you? Truly one incurs so much knowledge by the time they are in kissing distance of the MDs that one is almost in denial about actually taking ownership of it. You might think you dont but you do!

He hadmore than 100admissions inlast 12 months with alcohol related problems. He had underwent number of detoxing regimes. Everytime he went home and restarted drinking. He was again admitted with for detox. During his 7 day at hospital, he become very agressive and disruptive. He ran away from ward two times for thepolice to bring him back. Ended up having sectioned and having two clinical and one secuirty staff guarding his room. I would like know the experineces of other clinicians on similar admissions across other nhs trusts? do other trusts have different policies? impact of such admissions onhis fellowpatient care? does primary care help such patients?-0pvtinan6d1kmb4hk1b9j	ajan	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
401	88	1	We have a local policy for our community hospital - 3 admissions for detox in the preceding6 months means you are barred for the next 6 months. Patients admitted for detox who discharge themselves should most definitely not be brought by the police nor subjected to sectioning (unless there is an additional underlying mental health issue). Whoever sectioned this man could find themselves in serious trouble.This man is cearly not motivated to stop drinking and, harsh as it may sound, he should just be allowed to get on with it.-97	skyesteve	29/10/2012 1:25 PM	0	0
402	88	1	"As a UK GP I find treating alcoholic patients difficult . One does have successes, but one must accept that you will have more failures than successes.I try to try to listen and to try and help my patient make sensible choices. Everyone is different, butI tend to refer to local NHS and voluntary services.For some patients ""Antibuse"" is useful. I would like there to be more detoxification units , but I accept that the success rate is low.I was interested in one Polish patients partner who told me that in Poland quite a common treatment is a 3 monthly depot injectionequivalent to ""antibuse"". The treatment is not available in the UK.I suppose my advice is, don't beat your self up over alcohol patients who go back to alcohol, is part of the problem.

404	90	1	I came from an era where in my pre-clinical years tere was no internet available, and in my final clinical years internet was still in its infancy with regards to medical education. Knowledge meant books, and the lucky ones would find a nice medical an audio or video-cassette tape or a CD (later). This may have resulted in an urge to teach medical residents nad tell them what I suffered to learn.   Time gap made education different, where medical residents are suffering the opposite (information over-load), sometimes, unable, unwilling to hear/learn, most if not all smart phones, tablets, iPads, and computers at hand. They study at their own pace, do not find medical pearls or clinical experience as valuable as a website.   I am not sure what would be a different way to help them without spoon-feeding the, I also wonder whether with this technological era, the image of a doctor changed from the person with a huge info on his/her mind, to a person who is versatile at searching.

406	90	1	If I may say something about Law students. When I get a new student to supervise inevitably they will have a laptop and/or a tablet and always a smart phone. I make no comment initially to the student about their use and observe them during client interviews. What usually happens is that during such a client interview they furiously tap the keyboard trying to getting an almost verbatim record of what is said lest they forget a single point.   Afterwards when the student and I are alone in my office I ask the student what he/she thought of the meeting? What were the key matters that were identified? What should be our plan of action now we have gleaned direct evidence from the horses mouth? Usually the student will then turn to their lap top and scroll down to locate the information required to answer the questions. I let them take whatever time they need and ultimately they come up with some sort of answers that they think will be correct. Finally I ask them what was their impression of the client? (I am hoping they will answer with such observations about whether the client appeared to be truthful, are they likely to make a good impression as a witness if the case came to court?).   They are usually not very successful exercises initially. I explain to them that it is my view (so therefore other people have different views and ultimately everyone must decide what technique is best for them) that it is better to just keep a pen and paper to hand and just jot down key points as the interview flows. The client needs to know that they have the full attention of the lawyer (because the lawyer will be making a big difference in their life in the future) and eye contact helps to assess the clients reliability. If you desperately keep writing or typing down everything you are missing probably 90% of relevant information you need.   Next time I ask them to try the system I suggest and compare them. Invariably second time round they do so much better and seem to realise that although technology can be utilised invaluably in the practice of law it does not mean you have to use it for everything. For example I used to love spending hours in the law library reading through weighty tombs and my table would be covered with large texts, periodicals and Law reports. I still do some of my work in the old fashioned way because it also allows me peace from telephones etc etc.   Computers and the internet have been invaluable for legal research by making the search for relevant information very quick and comprehensive. Law students also are very lucky because there is so much access via the internet at their fingertips - it would be wrong of me to tell students to do it the old fashioned way.   A general comment about Law students which I expect will be true of medical students is that (as one would expect) some are keen, very active and try to get as much as they can from their attachment. Others are clearly less motivated and don't seem to have an awful lot of interest in what they are doing. After a few days if I have a student of the latter type I will have a strong discussion with the student. If they are not very interested in the attachment I suggest to them that they withdraw and I will arrange for another student to come - we have a very long waiting list for students and those with law degrees waiting to spend learning time with us because we are one organisation of only three in the UK that deals with defending medical professionals - in light of that I want students who appreciate the value of the experience they will gain.   kirked-gl9	kirked	5/9/2014 8:46 AM	1	0
407	90	1	Sometimes finding the reference text to study is little challenging but now a days internet is quite helpful in sourcing the recommended text. The success of technology and internet study has very positive attitudes among students.	Joseph Diaz	14/4/2016 5:01 AM	0	0
408	90	1	Kirked   Aspects of what you describe are certainly also problems with medical students. If there is genuinely a need to record a fulltranscript of a conversation with either apatient or clientthen, with the patient/client's permission, it is surely better to record the conversation digitally and either review this forlearning purposes or for the patient/client's benefit, using contemporaneous brief key points noted. We don't need to revisit all the concerns on an oldthreadaboutthis but presumably a 'typed' transcriptisnot really any different, legally,to a voice recording so the latter needn't present serious problemsgiven proper consent and confidentiality.   In addition to missing a considerable proportion of whatthey are supposed to be picking up,these students might need to be reminded that it's also just rude not to give your full attention to whoever is trying to tell you something or have a conversation. I heard countless patients complaining about clinicians who spent most of the consultation looking ata screen. Occasionally, of courseit's extremely useful to share screeninformation or images with the patientat the time.   As Joseph Diaz says, the internet has been invaluable in gaining quick access to information; it's simply that it's a step that shouldusually wait until the humaninteraction has finished. Despite all the lip service given to so-called 'communication skills' there are too many who simply don'tappreciate the vital importance ofmindful attention. Going back to Sidhom's original concern about 'spoon-feeding', it is certainly the case that many students and trainees complain that they receive no teaching even when offered excellent opportunities to learn from a Socratic type of tutorial. The irony is that they probably learned no more even when spoon-fed.-ql1cwb3br1k8d6bgf4bc8a8duf9a6mc4hjy1b1b3k2az0i8as8	Maxim	14/4/2016 2:18 PM	0	0

421	95	1	"Many thanks. Initially I had thought this might refer to postgraduate education and the way this can be used for income generation. Of course medical greed was rampant even when medical education was relatively free in the UK but I have the impression that the current system , which leaves many students with a significant debt , has enccouraged doctors to concentrate even more on their earning capacity and given it respctability. It will be interesting to see in a few years time whether there is a difference in attitudes between those who have been through a private medical school and those who have not. In the meantime in the UK there is a problem of recruitment into those specialties where the opportunities for very high income levels is less. Pricking the bubble by reducing the rewards could be counter productive and might need to be selective.. Does anyone have any UK private health insurance data? At one time the companies made some effort to reign in some of the greedier abuses but suspect it has been easier just to pass on higher premiums to the customer. It would be great to feel that the private sector could make the pickings less attractive financially - and equally if the NHS stopped just trying to buy its way out of political targets with ""waiting list moneys"" .and concentrated on having adequate numbers of staff.

429	97	1	This is a good question and the simple answer would be that there is no single or simple answer. I facilitated PBL groupsfor a couple of years fairly recently and it became clear that there can be quite a gap between the theory and practice of PBL, the structure of which probably varies somewhat between Medical Schools.   The first requirement is to be clear about what needs to be learned. This varies from some fairly clearcutclinical science,that can be assessed in conventional ways, through to the ability to work in a team, leadership, feedback, analysis and explanatory skills. I am not sure anyone knows the best way to assess these latter capabilities but using the group itself will certainly play a major role and this itself forms a good test of the ability to feedback constructively.   The difficulty with PBL, from my own experience, is mainly around the concept of self-directed learning. This can too easilybecome a sort of 'teach-yourself' clinical science and medicine which is not acceptable when it is merely a substitute for some good basic teaching from experts. When complex clinical scenarios are presented to years 1 and 2 students before such good teachingit can have little meaning and this causes frustration.   I hope this is of some value. And I didn't once use those irritating words 'issue' or 'competence'!-wf9aza5ykbr3lvnua5n0d1	Maxim	11/12/2014 11:18 AM	1	0

435	98	1	"Many book titles invoke another work, use a famous, infamous or obscure quotation, but to nick the whole thing from another book???   ""The Narrow Road to the Deep North"" is, was, a collection of poems and prose by the 17th Century Japanese poet, Matsuo Basho.  He wrote Haiku, a poetry format of 17 syllables, which would appear to be needlessly restricted.  However, as I have no knowledge of the language, I must rely on the excellent translation byNobuyuki Yuasa (Pub. Penguin Classics) and,apropos of Odysseus' thread on 'what is poetry', I find these short poems that often contrast perceptions, refreshing and calming. Very Zen, when I cannot speak of the new Man Booker winner. And am unlikely to.   A title that includes that word is of course ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"".  If you haven't read it, don't worry!  Although it describes travel on a bike, and the travails of that transport, it is a philosophical work, that uses the bike as a metaphor and the different ways of having and using one as parables.   Instead of just using something, the author advocates understanding it so as best to appreciate and change the problems we are faced with  - just like making a diagnosis!

444	102	1	Hello everyone. I am new to doc2doc, so please be nice.  I am a freshman in highschool, and plan on attending medical school after college. I know I have quite a bit of time before I have to start worrying about if I am going to get accepted or not, but from what I've learned-only rich, super intelligent people attend medical school.   Now, I know that might sound like a stereotype, but I just don't think I'm the kind of person who would get accepted... My GPA for last year was 3.8, and I plan on getting a 4.0 for the rest of highschool. I am an advanced pianist, intermediate/advanced horseback rider, and plan on doing several 4h projects next year (possibly involving medicine). I am also signing up for math, science, history, and english academic teams. I also run several semi-successful blogs, write a lot, and study anatomy/health, history, math, etc. Every day for at least an hour over the summer. In the spring I run track.   I guess my question is-am I doing the right things? Will these things matter more when I am in college, or do my highschool years count as well? I know a 4.0 in highschool is important to get accepted into the University I want to attend for an undergraduate degree, but are good SAT scores and good grades in college more important? Also, do sports count? I plan on playing tennis next year.   On top of all this, I am going to do volunteer work at nursing homes. But that would just be playing piano, so I could get some hours of volunteer work. Does volunteer work look good?   I'm just worried that I am not on the right track. Any advice is appreciated! Thank you all very much for your time.   I have also included a poll to see what people think about their careers.   -Meghan	CallMeDoctor	2/6/2014 10:06 PM	0	0
445	102	1	"Meghan,   Welcome! Medicine needs people who are as dedicated and self-directed as you are!   I presume that you are in the US, and I fear that the details of the US educational system are beyond me, so I can't comment on grades, nor on subjects that US medical schools expect you to have studied. I hope that someone from the 'Faculty' of D2D can help you!   In the UK, demand for medical school places is high, andthe highest gradesin our ""A-levels"" are demanded. More is expected and volunteering comes high. One of our UK contributorsis in your situation, and their teachers predicted high grades, but thye were told that their CV needed boosting with more evidence of community contributions. You already intend to volunteer at a nursing home, but do not see that as ""just playing piano"". Use your talents in music and inriding. Music as therapy needs volunteers http://musictherapy.imnf.org/as does ridinghttp://www.horsesthatheal.org/volunteers.html (just two links to US websites about these)   Good luck!   John   PS Your poll asks about pay. In the UK doctors are well paid, maybe not to US standards but comfortable. I know of doctors who go abroad and work for nothing, coming back home to earn enough to go out again, so I am cautious to say this, but I will. In the US, and now here in the UK, a doctor needs to earn well to repaytheir education fees,but that is not what a doctor works for. A doctor is well paid just by being one, by the gratitude of their patients for simple care, bysuccess and rare failure of the treatment they give, and by being one of the few professionals that stillhave the respect of the community. You aspire to a great tradition, do not consider it as an investment.-4y8bzctla3jsa5aa0ca1a3nydb6ahba7doa9b4fa0faa9laa6eva4ba0hze8"	John D	3/6/2014 9:46 AM	0	0
446	102	1	Meghan - Welcome and I wish you well but worry about your questions. Pay may be relevant but really is not the main thing which determined whether many of us have regrets about going into medicine or not. Just giving doctors more money does not seem to produce satisfaction anyway. The subject has also changed a lot - disillusionment in the UK often seems centred around new issues (work patterns , so many of the disorders now are self-induced , patient expectations etc...). You sound the sort of person we need - a bit of brightness helps but it is not the be-all and end-all. In Europe there are other ways of qualifying - in particular by training in another European country - and once qualified one can then prove (or of course disprove) one's competence as a doctor in a practical way.   PS I have known a number of doctors who have opted out of medicine after qualifying and perhaps any questions about regrets should address them . I do not know how you would contact them , but perhaps someone should do this as a project if it has not been done. One of my own family went to a prestigious medical school - for one term. Medicine is just not right for some folk and he had the good sense to realise that early on. Perhaps career advice is better now , but sometimes one just goes where the competition is without thinking about it seriously enough. Times change - when I left school I never really thought about earning a living although I realised that I would have to do it some day. Much the same way that most folk never think about their death - but recognise it may come one day.......-ht6bo4	sken	3/6/2014 10:07 PM	0	0

For this reason I have the greatest respect for healers, Ayurvedic formulations who have genuine goodness within, for the welfare of their patients, rather than purely financial benefit.   Medical profession seeking financial benefit alone, cannot expect peace of mind. We must remember, in life, there is the never changing law, as we do to others, so also, will be done to us. If we prescribe medication which makes people diseased such as pharmaceuticals, first our seed, then ourselves, too will be attacked.   So be it.	Marma2014	4/6/2014 3:58 PM	0	0

451	103	1	The poll is a bit too binary - I think there's more to it than exam grades vs everything else.   At national appointment panels points are allocated for excellence at an undergraduate level, but more points are allocated for clinical accumen, communication skills, commitment to speciality etc.   In general, I think people grow as doctors at different points in their career - I know doctors who were average up to registrar level who are now excellent consultants; great foundation doctors who didn't make the step up to ST jobs.   I think I was a pretty average student, and only really got interested in the medicine I was doing when I revised for my Membership exam.	DundeeChest	7/5/2014 12:39 AM	0	0

456	103	1	There is data in the UK on which medical school produce doctors who will do well in professional exams. Of course there's an 8 year lag betwen changing a medical degree and seeing the results.   University of Dundee did very badly in this analysis 4 years ago (I'll try to find the reference) being in teh bottom 3 schools wrt MRCP. However, it does will wrt MRCGP. So, do we train students to be good GPs? Perhaps, but I suspect there's more to it. Particularly as our ST trainees, regardless of their graduatiing school, do very well at MRCP. So the place you're working when you sit PACES seems to have an influence too.-rnq8n7a5b5b9	DundeeChest	8/5/2014 9:09 AM	0	0
457	103	1	academics wise, yes. but iof u see a larger picture comprising enterprenuership, money minting, risk taking behaviours & so called extremely successful practices - they are indeed the domain of those with poor medical grades.   the reason behind is that those with good grades often stick to ETHICS, and at the end, work for the better ones as chief consultant. Over a long period of time, this makes things difficult for the recent graduates who wish to work ethically.-cr	Sachin India	8/5/2014 2:29 PM	0	0
458	103	1	It is not a yes or no question.   I've seen colleagues and students who did remarkably well with exams, yet their clinical years were much less glamorous.   And I've seen people struggling with exams and later doing great in clinical setup.   If someone is great with exams that doesn't say he /she has great hands for surgery.   We must also understand that people grow and change in the course of time. Some are good from beginning, some are late bloomers. Some are very good at the beginning and then are less impressive.   It comes down to the individual at the end. Yes, there is something that holds promise in good students with good grades, but there are also those who start less impressively and grow during the years.   Making a doctor and being a doctor is a constantly developing process, and should be viewed as such.   Still, there are those with less hope and the hopeless that won't be good whatever you do..   It is also important to remember that grades and exams measure only what we make them to measure.   So it is very much up to the people who write the exam to incorporate the right questions that are intended to measure what one believes is the essene of the course.   I can say that there are also misses in that respect.-fr7av	yoram chaiter	8/5/2014 9:42 PM	1	0
459	103	1	Yoram is right. The whole thing is complicated. A test might predict your outcome later in life, but also it might not.   Some people who do well at tests have just a special gifts for them, but wont do well in daily routine.In Germany, surgeons associations have recently called for not over-estimating tests or exams ( mostly because girls tend to excel at them here - many boys dont get into med school nowadays because girls have better marks, and so on. Most newly employed judges are women, too, for the same reasons).-xpw3b9	Carolin	9/5/2014 2:56 PM	1	0
460	104	1	International Journal of Infectious Diseases: Unexpected and Rapid Spread of Zika Virus in The Americas - Implications for Public Health Preparedness for Mass Gatherings at the 2016 Brazil Olympic Games   Mass gatherings at major international sporting events put millions of international travelers and local host-country residents at risk of acquiring infectious diseases, including locally endemic infectious diseases. The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently aroused global attention due to its rapid spread since its first detection in May 2015 in Brazil to 22 other countries and other territories in the Americas. The ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, has also been associated with a significant rise in the number of babies born with microcephaly and neurological disorders, and has been declared a Global Emergency by the World Health Organization. This explosive spread of ZIKV in Brazil poses challenges for public health preparedness and surveillance for the Olympics and Paralympics which are due to be held in Rio De Janeiro in August, 2016. We review the epidemiology and clinical features of the current ZIKV outbreak in Brazil, highlight knowledge gaps, and review the public health implications of the current ZIKV outbreak in the Americas. We highlight the urgent need for a coordinated collaborative response for prevention and spread of infectious diseases with epidemic potential at mass gatherings events.      What will Zika mean for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games?-r82b46ciz6422a7meat3	Sabreena	10/2/2016 10:57 AM	4	0
461	104	1	A very difficult point, Sabreena, and one on which I'm torn.   I have my place at the Games so I really, really want them to continue.  Despite the inoculations I must have to go to Brazil, from Hep A to rabies, there isn't one for Zika, or Dengue, so I intend to use the strongest solution of DEET I can find and apply it diligently, sleep under a DDT impregnated net and avoid evenings in the open. And anyway, for an elderly male, Zika is almost not an issue.   But I have children who are presently forming families.   I do NOT want to think I could come back and carry Zika near them so I will have to avoid them for at least two weeks (advice from tropical diseases guru - personal communication, as he said he could not possibly publish that as official!).   And mosquitos of the Aedes species just don't live in the UK, at present anyway - malaria existed in the Thames marshes and Norfolk in the past, and will in the future, as climate change takes place, but not now. http://pmj.bmj.com/content/80/949/663.full So the UK is relatively safe at present, and returning Gamesmakers won't be a problem, here.   But there will be visitors to the Games from throughout that part of the world where Aedes exists.  That's between the isotherms for 10C in winter, and includes almost all of South America, which is already infected, Middle and North America up to California to North Carolina, the whole of Africa, Europe from Southern France to Greece, the Middle East, India, the Far East. most of Australia and the Pacific Islands.  Phew! They ARE going to get Zika!   I really don't know, and I fear that no one knows.  We don't even know if there really is an epidemic of microcephaly in South America, but the human consequences of that if real are horrible.  And we have only six months to find out.

462	104	1	Cancelling the Olympic Games is not a solution of ZIka, we should find out its proper vaccine or antibiotics. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. If you have any one of these, you need to go to the urgent care clinic.	CAUrgentCare	12/2/2016 10:56 AM	3	0
463	104	1	"Thank you, CAUrgentCare!     For anyone not a foetus, Zika seems to be a flu-like illness, with no (?) common complications.  So the concern is only for the foetus, What do we know about the association?  This report from CDChttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6503e2.htm finds that in the past Brazil had ""approximately 0.5 cases per 10,000 live births"" whihc was thought to be an under-report, with a true rate of 1-2/10K.  In only the second half of 2015, 20/10K have been reported, but that no previous head circumference records were made and there had been no laboratory confirmation of Zika infection in the mothers or infants, so that bias is inevitable.  As usual, and as the BMJ bans, more data is needed.  But that didn't help me make up my mind - the Games should continue.  Zika WILL spread to the other parts of the world where transmitting mosguitoes live, the Games might let it do so a bit quicker, that's all.  John-nsyb1hub1bv8rb1vpe"	John D	12/2/2016 12:15 PM	3	0
464	104	1	Many thanks to Sabreena for this excellent post. Apart from John D many of us have been wondering about this. It is yet another nail in the potential coffin of the Brazil Olympics. There seems increasingly little hope that the infra structure will be in place , some of the watersport areas are likely to be unhealthy , ticket sales I believe are not going well and now Zika. Many of the sports now have other world class competitions and athletes from these may prefer not to compete - particularly if some of the top contenders +/- their countries are absent following drug scandals.   There is also the problem that Brazil is running into problems in its anti-mosquito campaign.   It could be that events will snowball and cancellation become inevitable but that might be pretty disastrous for Brazil and it would require a kirked to decide how far compensation would be payable.   Any advice on returning travellers might tend to be overcautious. The idea of John D in quarantine for 2 weeks with just a computer for company could be interesting for doc2doc...   Apart from the foetal risks a bit more is emerging to suggeat that G-B may be a rare complication - but that can be pretty major. It might have a low mortality in its own right but some of us might well prefer demise to really severe disease and decline ventilation.   The one bit of good that might emerge is that the UK needs to look at its mozzie breeding grounds. They exist in most gardens etc... and it is only a matter of time before we have some of these mosquitos breeding in the UK .-k45	sken	15/2/2016 3:15 PM	3	0

If they think it is tetanus prone, then to theatre for 'debridement' . If it is due to blunt trauma then excision of pieces of flesh that have lost their blood supply - have become ""devitalised"" - and thorough cleaning which may include incision to open the wound and allow vigorous scrubbing!

495	113	1	Medication-use problems are an issue that policymakers are trying to find more effective solutions for, seeking ways to optimise the role of healthcare professionals in managing these patients. Community pharmacists are now being recognised as a lesser used resource for improving patients' use and understanding of their medications - meaning that revisions are being made to healthcare policies to expand the authority of pharmacists in this way.  Clinical performance of healthcare professionals has been shown to display small improvements when being presented with audit data and feedback of their care. However, there have not been studies done for pharmacists, to evaluate whether the use of audit and feedback could increase pharmacists' provision of services or improve performance on standardised medication-use measures.  This study, by Winslade et al, seeks to evaluate the impact of such performance feedback to community pharmacists on the provision of services and quality of hypertensive and asthmatic patients' medication use. In a randomised, controlled, single-blind trial in 1,833 community pharmacies in Canada, this study used provincial billing data to measure performance, and mailed comparative feedback reported the pharmacy-level percentage of dispensings to patients either non-adherent to antihypertensive medications or those overusing asthma drugs.  The authors found that this comparative pharmacy performace feedback did increase the provision of asthma pharmacy services. However, they did not find that audit and feedback was effective in providing an improvement in managing non-compliance of antihypertensive medication, or in the performance of medication-use measures.  What are your views on audit and feedback? What do you think could improve the management of non-compliance of antihypertensive medication in this setting?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   More information about this article:  Abstract              ObjectiveTo evaluate the impact of comparative performance feedback to community pharmacists on provision of professional services and the quality of patients medication use.    DesignRandomised, controlled, single-blind trial.    SettingAll 1833 community pharmacies in the Quebec province, Canada.    Participants1814 pharmacies not opting out and with more than 5 dispensings of the target medications during the 6-month baseline were randomised by a 22 factorial design to feedback first for hypertension adherence (907 control, 907 intervention) followed by randomisation for asthma adherence (791 control, 807 intervention). 1422 of 1814 pharmacies had complete information available during the follow-up for hypertension intervention (706 intervention, 716 control), and 1301 of 1598 had the follow-up information for asthma (657 intervention, 644 control).    InterventionUsing provincial billing data to measure performance, mailed comparative feedback reported the pharmacy-level percentage of dispensings to patients non-adherent to antihypertensive medications or overusing asthma rescue inhalers.    Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe number of hypertension/asthma services billed per pharmacy and percentage of dispensings to non-adherent patients over the 12months post intervention.    ResultsFeedback on the asthma measure led to increased provision of asthma services (control 0.2, intervention 0.4, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.46). However, this did not translate into reductions in patients overuse of rescue inhalers (control 45.5%, intervention 44.6%, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01). For non-adherence to antihypertensive medications, feedback resulted in no difference in either provision of hypertension services (control 0.7, intervention 0.8, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.82) or antihypertensive treatment adherence (control 27.9%, intervention 28.0%, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00). Baseline performance did not influence results, and there was no evidence of a cumulative effect with repeated feedback.    ConclusionsComparative pharmacy performance feedback increased the provision of asthma pharmacists services but did not improve the performance on medication-use measures. Billing data can be used to evaluate the impact of billable services rendered by pharmacists on the quality of patients medication use.

498	115	1	About 2 weeks ago I was listening to a chap who suffered from severe cluster headaches and who found his reserve treatment was a concoction of magic mushrooms when other treatments failed. To-day the news is that they are (or at least the active ingredient psilocybin) seems to be rescue treatment for severe depression when other treatments are failing.   This is just where we need someone like Edzard Ernst to advise and explore. What a pity that the pro-alternative medicine crowd had him sidelined. He really should have known that a post designed to look at the subject was a post to promote it not to explore its basis and viability. Particularly when going totally against the belifs of the heir to the throne.   Of course there may be something in these magic mushroom stories. I still remember some patients taking Digitalis Folia before purer forms of digoxin became the rule.	sken	17/5/2016 12:30 PM	0	0
499	115	1	"Sken,   Passing across the drugs derived from plants and bacteria, from the digitalis your mention through antibiotics, quinine and artemisinin, the cannabinoids, the opiates and many others, arriving at the psilocins derived from the psilocybe species (magic mushrooms), we have a range of highly active pharma-agents, from the highly developed, understood and nowadays synthesied, to drugs that are still taken covertly and directly from their original plants (OK a mushroom isn't a plant, but anyway).   That is completely different from the crystal gazers, bone twitchers and purveyors of 'energised water', that Prof Ernst has fought so hard against.  I hope that your patient has a reliable source of his preferred self medication. Do you recall the BMJ article about the eminent author who had ""picked and cooked mushrooms all his life"", but who gave himself and his wife complete and permanent renal failure by eating the wrong ones?  http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e5262   There are only three fungi in the Uk that are so distinctive that they are safe to eat.  The field mushroom, the Shaggy Cap (Lawyers Wig) and the Puff Ball, as long as the last is eaten unripe, white all the way through.  I won't try to describe them - plenty of that on't Net!

500	115	1	Gosh, sken!  You or your patient is either prescient or very well informed!   The Lancet Psychiatry published yesterday a paper on the use of psilocybin in severe, intractable depression.  The paper does not mention, but news reports do because the senior author, Prof. David Nutt has said, that this study on a Class A drug (in the group with heroin and cocaine) took years to set up, and cost seventy times more per dose, because of that.   The paper is athttp://www.thelancet.com/pb/assets/raw/Lancet/pdfs/S2215036616300657.pdf   I note that in this small study, that carefully selected its patients, the results were all positive and long lasting, and that psilocybin has a different mode of action (5-HT2A receptor agonism) to other antidepressants, so that Prof.Nutt's plan to progress to a much larger DBRC trial should be supported.   Apart from anything else, the Prof. clearly has a reliable source for his favourite medication!   John-jzyyiu	John D	18/5/2016 7:52 AM	0	0
501	115	1	Magic Mushrooms,      Just another mode of action to make people stupider! Along with Alcohol, Marijuana, Heroin, Crack Cocaine, and any number of drugs this will serve to dumb down the masses, Indeed, Gone are the days of coffee shops and intellectual discourse. Drugs such as this only harm, they do no good. Of course a great many Doctors will support it, mostly in Psychiatry I would think due to the money making potential. In the USA, sadly around 20% of the population is on antidepressants, and I dare say of the 20% virtually 98% do not need them. Social Services purposely puts these people on Zoloft and other SSRI's to make them part of the Social system that is under the heel of the Mental health umbrella. Will Humanity ever wake up? Will People cast aside their cocktail of drugs, and emerge back into the fold of usefull employment, and become citizens again?      DuaneF-mixtc9la4ar2j2cyca8f0d2a5	DuaneF	18/5/2016 12:55 PM	0	0
502	115	1	Duane,   I fear you malign psychiatrists by accusing them of prescribing to make money.   If you read the paper, you will learn that the pharmacological cost of each course of treatment was very expensive, about 1200, but that if it had niot been for the special circumstances of using a Class A drug, it would have been about 30.  Two doses, one to test for adverse reaction the next therapeutic, for an effect that lasted three months, 30 pence a day (44 cents)  There are few new drugs that cost that little!   Established antidepressants cost the NHS from 1.70/$2.49(risperidone) to 4 pence/ 6 cents (Quetiapine) ( Regionakl DRug & Thereapeutics Centre, Nexcastle UK, COST COMPARISON CHARTS January 2016 Online at http://gmmmg.nhs.uk/docs/cost_comparison_charts.pdf Accessed on 18/5/16).   The patients in the study had intensive psychiatric cover, obviously needed for experimental treatment but costly.  However, the drug cost if this treatment became established should be very competitive.   John-nl0ab1hzgb6kun1eo5hkd0	John D	18/5/2016 6:26 PM	0	0
503	115	1	Hi John,      No I do not Malign Psychiatrists, at least not abroad, but in the USA, I have seen the work of Social Services, and the Mental Health professionals, Psychiatrists, Psychologists, and counselors, who all delve into social experimentation. I am aware of the bad practices in the USA only, and I have seen them first hand!   I must confess too, that all fields, are corrupt in some way or another, Police, Lawyers, Judges, Doctors etc, again, I only speak of the USA. Things need changing, and improving.

504	115	1	Entheogens (LSD, magic mushrooms, etc.) in psychiatry have an intriguing history, they started in early 1960s, became popular in treatment of depression, alcoholism, and in psychotherapy as well. They were stopped due to emerging psychosis as a side effect. Some argue that it was more of a political decision rather than a medical one.   Recently, interested returned in their mechansim of action, and it became restudied for these purposes, the preliminary results seem promising.   I am not particularly interested in the origin of a substance, but rather in the rigorousness of methodology to study the way it works. I guess it is worth more studying.   I know it's been portrayed as virtue to criticise big pharma, but in a capitalist society; I wonder what would be the alternative to big pharma when it comes to drug development.-bj	Sidhom	20/5/2016 10:42 AM	0	0
505	115	1	Sidhom,      There are alternatives, IE - Science based Pharmaceutical companies, as opposed to greedy capitalist based Big Pharma! I am quite sure if other sciences like toxicology, My Own CBRN field etc can function in a pure science mode so can big pharma, this is perhaps where more Govt oversight is in order! Greed in medicine, particularly Pharma can be the downfall. The nuclear industry functions pretty well, overall, and I am sure Big Pharma can be made to function as well.

516	117	1	I am a producer at Outline Productions, an independent television production company. We are currently making a one-off feature length documentary for Channel 4 exploring offence with Trevor Phillips OBE, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The programme will be an intelligent and thought provoking examination of the issues and debates surrounding freedom of speech and the right to offend.   We are keen to explore how offence can influence healthcare. We have spoken to some medical professions that have told us doctors are increasingly concerned about their patients taking offence to things they say. We would very much like to hear some real world examples of this. We have heard that the following situations are not uncommon:   GPs feeling unable to tell parents their children are overweight.  Patients accusing doctors of racism when ethnicity has been raised during diagnosis discussions.  Doctors feeling unable to contradict a patient's self-diagnosis or belief in alternative therapies such as healing crystals or homeopathy.    Have you experienced any situations like this at work? Do you feel that patients wellbeing may be at risk because medical professionals are not free to speak openly and honestly? If so, we would be very grateful if you got in touch. Initially all communication would be off-the-record and confidential. Following an informal research chat we may like to discuss whether youd be interesting in appearing in the documentary in some capacity.

518	117	1	"Jamie G - Good luck with this study. The biggest problem in this context is over obesity and the failure of this to be seen as a problem. Just read some of our ""upmarket"" papers where the problem is not only poorly recognised but also comment that an individual or offspring as having a problem is seen as offensive and judgemental. Yet evidence suggests that so many of those where overweight is a potential threat to health do not recognise that ""obesity"" applies to them. The net result is that medical opinion seems divided on whether this aspect of care should be raised with the person concerned. It is better to accept the status quo than to challenge it. Perhaps this is one reason why it was the leading reason for the recent perceived failure in giving the advice recommended for those who have had non STEMI heart attacks.    I am not sure what you have in mind as regards ""contradicting"" patients' views on diagnosis or alternative therapies. One works with patients and their beliefs - refuting or contradicting beliefs in something else and going beyond the medical remit. I would not refer for these other treatments , but if the patient chose to go ahead , then that was up to them. As regards self-diagnosis . the patient is often correct . As a patient , I have recently had 2-3 major diagnoses which I made on myself but were not recognised by the doctors concerned contributing to delays in referral for surgery on 2 counts.   I have now retired but recall very few examples where race or religion or even discussion about alcohol provided much friction where patients were concerned. What appalled me was where these were found amongst colleagues or those involved in employment and education. I hope things have improved.-mi0cd47b2cvc"	sken	13/5/2016 8:02 PM	0	0

532	120	1	Hello all,  Cardiology is an area of medicine that fascinates me, and hopefully after the long slog of medical school (provided I get in) it is something I would consider specialising in. Over the past few days I've been interested in how hot baths affect blood pressure. I have been taking my blood pressure using a portable BP device before and after a bath and, while admittedly the evidence isn't very scientific as the conditions are far from controlled, there seems to be a correlation. On all of the readings taken after a bath my systolic pressure seems to increase and my diastolic pressure seems to decrease. It lead me to wonder if there was any explanation to this, or whether it is just purely coincidental?  It would be interesting to hear your thoughts, Sam	samrneal	16/5/2013 11:59 AM	0	0
533	120	1	"You might be inetrested in this wee study Sam:Effects of Temperature on Blood Pressure Sarah Gardner, David Hoch, Bryan LaFonteCU Boulder, Fall 2007 We tested the effects of temperature changes on human blood pressure. As one of the vital signs, blood pressure is a helpful indicator of the bodys internal conditions. It is the measure of force against the arteries as blood is pumped throughout the body (Van Voorhees 2006). Blood pressure is constantly changing to maintain homeostasis within the body. Since temperature change can disrupt homeostasis, we predicted that blood pressure will adjust to maintain body heat. This will lead to a rise in blood pressure when temperatures drop and a drop in blood pressure when temperatures rise. We also predicted that heart rate will remain constant to avoid another deviation in homeostasis. Our hypothesis is that blood pressure will rise in cold temperatures, and lower in hot temperatures.  To test this hypothesis, we measured the subjects blood pressure while they were seated with their right hand in a beaker of cold water (5C), hot water (42C), and room temperature water (23C). Heart rate was measured to have a comparison against changes in blood pressure. This was done by taking the radial pulse of the left hand. We took three measurements of blood pressure and heart rate for each of the three beakers of water; the first after initial exposure, the next after 1  minutes, and the final after 3 minutes of exposure. We predicted that the average blood pressure in the cold water would be higher than the average blood pressure in the hot water.Our T-Test for means indicated that the blood pressure after exposure to cold temperatures was significantly greater (p=3.6 E -4) than the blood pressure after exposure to hot temperatures; with the average for the cold water being 133/90 mmHg and the average for the hot water being 121/78 mmHg. The average blood pressure for the room temperature water was 113/68 mmHg. There was no significant difference (p=0.29) between heart rates for the hot, cold, or room temperature water trials, for which the averages were 74, 76, and 76 bpm, respectively. Our regression tests showed that blood pressures for the cold water had a tendency to rise over time (R2=0.71), while the tendency of blood pressures in the hot water was to lower (R2=0.99). The results were consistent with our predictions; blood pressures were higher after exposure to cold water than exposure to hot water, while maintaining heart rate. This mechanism, increasing blood pressure without having to increase heart rate, prevents loss of body heat and helps sustain homeostasis. The major problem we encountered was the significant amount of time needed for each trial, preventing us from acquiring a large sample population and reducing the validity of our experiment. Human error while measuring blood pressure and heart rate could have also been a potential problem. Although our predications were confirmed by the results, our hypothesis was not completely accurate. Blood pressures after exposure to the hot water did lower, but after they rose initially. This resulted in a higher average blood pressure for the hot water results than the room temperature water results. An alternative hypothesis that would be more consistent with our results would state: blood pressure will increase after exposure to cold temperatures and decrease after a time of exposure to hot temperatures""-us4gaaaaaaaaaa70faaaaaaaaaa1896cra8a2852bq9z98rgu"	skyesteve	16/5/2013 1:17 PM	0	0

541	121	1	"That is a good answer   Learning bite   Remember the red flag features of STS[ 1 ][ 5 ]:     Size greater than 5 cm    Painful    Deep to the deep fascia    Increasing in size    Recurrent swelling after previous excision.    Patients presenting with a soft tissue lump that has any of the above features should be referred to a regional sarcoma centre as a two week referral upon presentation.   Overall five year survival for STS is 50% at five years; high and intermediate grade tumours in particular convey a 50% risk of metastasis. Median survival after detection of metastatic disease is 12 months.[ 5 ]   Treatment for metastatic sarcoma is with palliative intent and thus guided by patient preference as well as performance status and disease extent. Surgical excision, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are all treatments that are considered in order to provide symptomatic relief from both the original tumour and metastatic disease.[ 1 ][ 5 ]    The phrase ""unplanned excision (of a tumour)"" refers to the resection of mass, which is presumed to be benign, without appropriate preoperative imaging, biopsy, or attention to surgical margins, as in the above case. Re-excision of a tumour is often required. The patient must undergo an additional surgical procedure that may lead to increased morbidity. Hence it is important to avoid unplanned excision of lumps and bumps without imaging, both in the primary and secondary care settings.   Up to 40% of patients presenting to regional sarcoma centres have undergone previous unplanned excision of their sarcomas.[ 14 ]Unplanned excision invariably results in tumour positive margins and therefore a higher risk of local recurrence and need for further surgery. A 2008 study found that 59% of patients who had an unplanned excision had residual tumour present on re-excision.[ 15 ]   In order to prevent unplanned excisions, it is important that referring clinicians recognise the features of a soft tissue lump that could be indicative of a sarcoma.   Patients referred to a regional sarcoma centre after an unplanned excision will require the following:     Review of histology by a specialist pathologist    MRI imaging of the area of previous surgery    Staging CT scan of the chest to exclude pulmonary metastases    Wide re-excision is then carried out to reduce the risk of local recurrence.

562	125	1	Abstract 1   Insulin Pump for Type 2 Diabetes   Progressive hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes results from a progressive -cell failure together with a state of insulin resistance (1). Insulin deficiency worsens with the natural progression of type 2 diabetes, explaining the escape from oral antihyperglycemic agents and the need for exogenous insulin therapy (2).   The use of external pumps in patients with type 2 diabetes is a recent practice compared with that in type 1 diabetes, and its use is still debated. In only a few countries, such as in France and Israel, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external pump is an alternative in type 2 diabetes that the health authorities have allowed for reimbursement. The rationale for using pump therapy was first suggested by its use in case reports of type 2 diabetes with extreme insulin resistance and poor glycemic control (36). In such patients, insulin was administered transiently by intravenous insulin infusion allowing lower mean glucose level despite a 40% reduction of insulin requirements. The sequential use of 4-week intravenous insulin infusion followed by 1-year CSII in a group of patients with type 2 diabetes patients poorly controlled despite very high insulin requirements allowed a dramatic reduction of HbA1c (3%, 9 mmol/mol), while insulin requirements were reduced by one-third. Such beneficial effects of CSII were attributed to increased insulin sensitivity assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study (7). These observations raised the question as to whether insulin continuous administration by a pump device gives an advantage compared with the conventional approach of insulin intensification by multiple daily injections (MDIs). The evidence base is still under debate and will be discussed in this review   Abstract 2   Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a promising therapy, but the clinical evidence supporting it is mixed. Large randomized controlled trials have concluded that CSII was equivalent to multiple daily injections (MDI), whereas smaller trials have concluded that CSII was superior. Simpler insulin regimens of CSII have been investigated for T2DM and may lead to improved outcomes. Future directions in this area include simpler insulin pumps and the use of concentrated insulins (U-500), neither of which has left the feasibility stage of research. CSII may be appropriate for some people with T2DM, especially those for whom MDI therapy has failed.-yk0eq1ea52660r5i015anel4ae	alaminium	13/3/2016 12:13 AM	1	0

The last diabetic patient on continuous subcutaneous insulin pump infusion (CSII) that I saw was a 22 years old young lady with type 1 diabetes since 9 years old, a wealthy medical student with a private doctor and using CSII for 6 years. Her HBA1C was stable at 6.0% and that information was enough for me regarding her glycaemic control. I was called because of a recent appearence of microalbuminuria (mean of 52 mg of albumin/g of creatinine on two consecutive spots morning urines). My requested ABPM showed normal BP levels but a small decrease in the systolic BP decrease during sleep. So I started her on ramipril 10 mg at night with a follow-up after about 1 year with me as her BP and albuminuria doctor. I advised her private doctor to bring her HBA1C closest to normal ""as possible"" without Hypos (easy task right?).

579	127	1	We read with interest the recent BMJ editorial Rivaroxaban:Can we trust the evidence.1 which questions the conclusions from the ROCKET AF clinical trial on Rivaroxaban 2. Cohen raises questions about the accuracy of the INRs used for monitoring patients in the warfarin control arm and suggests that they may have compromised the validity of the published conclusions. The ROCKET investigators have defended their conclusions after re assessing the data in light of these concerns 3. The device used for INR testing in the warfarin control arm was not identified in the original publication but subsequently has been revealed as the INRatio Point of Care (POC) device. This device was the subject of a safety recall notice by FDA in 2014 due to clinically significantly lower readings compared to laboratory values, with the fault going back to 2002 (before the Rocket AF trial started). The BMJ editorial points out that a falsely low INR reading could mean that patients in the control arm may have had their warfarin dose unnecessarily increased leading to a greater risk of bleeding.   To ensure accuracy, POC INR testing should be subjected to the same level of quality control (QC) and quality management systems that laboratory INR testing has to meet. Appropriate and effective External Quality Assessment (EQA) for POC INR testing devices is possible 4 and there has been a POC INR EQA programme available in the UK for 20 years. In the UK NEQAS for Blood Coagulation EQA programmes we provide suitable material for several different devices and have over 4500 users enrolled in the programmes (January 2016). The POC device used in the warfarin control arm of the ROCKET AF study 2 is one which we evaluated to assess our EQA material suitability in 2010 but found we were unable to provide any suitable EQA material for this technology. To our knowledge no other programme provides EQA for this device. The lack of EQA and internal quality control (IQC) makes it difficult to assess the reliability of INR results obtained with this device.   Laboratory based INR testing in many countries is subject to accreditation, often against international ISO standards (ISO 15189) 5 which require participation in regular EQA as part of the quality management system. Currently the vast majority of POC INR testing in many countries is not subject to such accreditation and not all POC sites participate in EQA even when this is available. Although such participation for POC sites is not currently mandated by regulation, we believe it should be obligatory. Non-participation despite availability could have serious medico-legal implications in the event of untoward incidents. If the use of INR methods in the laboratory or in point of care was restricted to those for which satisfactory participation in EQA can be demonstrated, the issues of clinically significant problems in INR testing such as those which have led to the questioning of the ROCKET AF study could be more easily avoided.   POC INR testing has been in use for over two decades and in our view is safe, providing continuous QC assessment is in place in order to ensure that the INR results produced are valid and accurate 6.There are several published national and international guidelines stating the essential requirement for QC to ensure reliable results 7-9 when using POC INR devices. It would be inappropriate to view all POC devices for INR testing to be inferior to the laboratory measurements as this is not usually the case. POC devices can be accurate and precise giving reliable results in a very quick turnaround time. The key is to ensure the accuracy and precision of all INR results, whether derived from a POC device or from a laboratory method, with the use of both internal control and external quality assessment.

580	127	1	This Abstract confirms the variation between conventional methods of INR testing and POC INR testing devices         Abstract   External quality assessment (EQA) or proficiency testing is widely considered to be necessary for International Normalised Ratio (INR) determinations performed in conventional laboratory settings. There is increasing use of near-patient-test (NPT) or point-of-care (POC) INR devices and it is not known whether EQA is also necessary for these monitors. We report here on six years experience of proficiency testing for POC monitors used by health care professionals. Three devices were used by >10 centres who participated in the programme, the CoaguChek (CUC), the CUC-S and the TAS or Rapidpoint Coag. Not all users of the same type of monitor obtained the same INR result when analysing the same plasma sample. For the three monitors the CV of results in different centres was 11-14%. The variation between results in different centres could relate to inappropriately handled proficiency testing material, inaccuracies in the calibration of the system by the manufacturer or deterioration during transport/storage of the test strips. In each survey 10-11% of centres using POC monitors obtained INR results which were >15% different from those in other centres using the same monitors. For hospital laboratories using conventional INR techniques this figure was 12%. The relationship between INR results obtained by users of the Rapidpoint Coag or TAS monitor and results obtained by conventional techniques was not constant over the period of study. During one period INRs with TAS were 13.7% greater than with conventional methods. For the remaining three time periods results were similar. Our data suggest that the variation between INR results determined with three POC monitors show similar variation to that observed in hospital laboratories using conventional methods. Based on our data we recommend that users of these POC monitors participate regularly in an independent external proficiency testing programme.

584	129	1	I have grown old - unavoidable. i have not grown fat over the years - avoidable. What interests me is how I am being put at relative risk as well as inconvenience by the latter.   2 examples in health care. 1) For x-rays the standard exposure means an overdiagnosis of bone thinning. This led to bone densitometry - with the verdict that bones better than average for age. 2) For some drugs the dose is administered depending on the eGFR but this test seems very poorly understood and bodyweight is a crucial part of it. The problem is that the lab value is based on a weight I have never achieved even at my heaviest and my true eGFR is significantly lower than the value on the report. (Of course for most eGFR values it does not matter as the trend is what is significant). The second adds to my recent experiences of a long standing hobby horse that many of those requesting tests do not know how to interpret the results......   Someone pointed out recently that having CT facilities for the markedly overweight might well mean more irradiation for the not so fat.   Outside medical care I am increasingly aware of being disadvantaged by being what was seen as normal weight in times gone by as the UK at least caters more and more for the obese. I suppose the answer is that if I don't like it I should add to the number and put on a few stone?-jp9	sken	25/2/2016 8:40 PM	0	0

Sometimes it is useful to think what would I want if I, or a member of my family, were in the patients position.

587	130	1	Would it be too radical to suggest that an 'ER' (possibly this patient was not in the UK) doctor attempts at least a clinical differential diagnosis for the pain' based on features in the history and examination? 'Non-cardiac pain' is not a sufficient diagnosis with which to send a patient home.'Atypical' presumably means not typical of ischaemic cardiacpain. None of the testsresults mean thispaincouldn't still be due tomyocardial ischaemia but at least considerother places in which the pain could originate, includinguppergastrointestinal tract,biliary tract, aorta,pleura, chest wall or spine. Patients appreciate some attemptat a reasonedexplanation for their pain, even whenthiscomes with the caveat thatit's provisional. Withouteven attempting thisit's difficult to choose from 'some other tests'.Simply excluding immediately life-threatening cardiac ischaemiashouldnever bethe end of assessment of chest pain. Neither isthestocksuggestion 'probably GORD'.   As we've seenin several cases, havinginsufficient beds andinvestigation facilitiesover a weekend is unlikelybe an acceptable excuse if a patient is discharged andcomes to harm. What it does demonstrate, dearMr Hunt, is thatany extra number of junior doctors working at weekends on reduced pay is ever going to solve the problem ofproviding abdominalultrasounds, echocardiograms or CT scans.-ry9asdycfasrey6b7cfxv2a7an1be0ariu3ca7dgi0bldf7byavy0a8co5aq1it	Maxim	12/2/2016 3:31 PM	0	0

592	131	1	I think that it becomes more and more apparent that there are not enough NHS Hospital beds. I think most of the A and E problems would be made better if there were more Hospital beds.   Many hospital beds have been lost though hospital closures and amalgamations.   There has been great emphasis on community care and early discharge. But there are patients who cannot be managed in the community and need admission. There is a huge pressure not to admit patients and also pressure to discharge patients early.   Success in Hospital now seems to be discharging patients from Hospital rather than caring for them and when possible curing them.   My opinion is that we need more and not less Hospital beds.-ots	PatLush	17/1/2016 11:01 PM	0	0
593	131	1	Maxim   Thanks   Yes I think that some of the younger GPs would like to look after appropriate patients in cottage hospitals. The problem seems to be that accountants looking, from a rather narrow view point , deem cottage hospitals to be too expensive.	PatLush	18/1/2016 12:54 PM	0	0
594	131	1	Pat   It might be important first to decide what sorts of patients need the hospital beds. Just providing more generic beds for 'medical patients' would probably just result in their being used as very expensive recuperation facilities. There is certainly a lack of beds for some types of patients, for example with serious acute psychiatric problems.   whatever beds are provided they have to be fully financed and staffed. Moving money from hospitals to community while sending more patients to hospital is a disgrace.   Perhaps some GPs would like to return to the practice of looking after appropriate patients in community/cottage hospitals?	Maxim	18/1/2016 1:19 PM	0	0
595	132	1	For now I think the news that 35% of UK doctors were born elsewhere is good news. This applies to very many of our senior folk - particularly from India - and many with a wealth of Uk qualifications as well. I see this as a recruitment of excellence. But I suspect we are in period of transition and in future the influx will be from Europe. It would be interesting to see the equivalent figures from the USA.   If this 35% still applies in 20 years time I would be more concerned (except I won't be around).. Is there really going to be an exodus of UK graduates : I seriously doubt it despite mutterings. Perhaps our projected needs for numbers will not be met from UK born and net immigration will remain large.   At the other end of the scale is Poland with only 2.7 % foreign born. Perhaps a combination of language and historical issues and Poland not so attractive for foreign high-fliers help to explain the disparity? Or perhaps Poland produces just the right number of doctors through its own training programmes.	sken	29/12/2015 10:53 PM	0	0
596	132	1	"I know this isn't a peer-reviewed academic journal, sken, but it is useful to give a reference for a fact that you use in your argument.  Where did yours come from, please?   I'd say the proportion of NHS doctors who qualified outside the UK is more important that where they came from.  I don't know what proportion would indicate that the UK is unable to train sufficient doctors, but if the number was as high as 35% I'd say that was a concern.   I don't think that Poland is a fair comparison.  It is an unusual country, one that didn't exist for many years in our preceeding centuries, and where, like Welsh or Irish, the language and nationhood was suppressed.  And one occupied by the Soviets without a significant indigenous Russian population, unlike some other Baltic states. As a result, the West was excluded while immigration fro the East was most unwelcome, and the Polish medical cadre was entirely home grown.  And very good at it, in the hard circumstances of comunist rule!   How about France? In 2007, 14% of doctors in France and 3% of nurses were not born in France (OECD International Migration Outlook:https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rMXVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=Where+were+French+doctors+born?&source=bl&ots=f4U2iGWVXc&sig=OarU4QCGZwW8jfzDJOo8TitGdeY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinj67BwoPKAhWKOhQKHZj0AmAQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&q=Where%20were%20French%20doctors%20born%3F&f=false ) after those born in Algeria when that was French departement and so with French nationality were excluded.   From the same publication, eight years ago, and in Europe overall, 18% of doctors and 11% of nurses were not born in their contry of employment. The following table shows the proportion of foreign trained doctors in a a number of OECD countries, in the '70s and 2005:           Per centages         70s         2005           Australia         24         25           Canada         31         22           Germany         5         5           Finland         1         7           France         1         6           United Kingdom         26         33           Netherlands         1         6           New Zealand         27         36           Portugal         1         5           Sweden         5         16           United States         22         25       This shows that about half of foreign born French doctors trained in France and that your ""35%"" of foreign born doctors in the UK, if that also means trained abroad, hasn't changed that much in forty years.  The NHS has certainly not fallen apart under the care of our foreign trained colleagues, indeed many would say that without them it would have done so, long ago.

597	132	1	John D  Many thanks. The numbers with a first qualification in the UK is I think a separate if related issue and one has to make do sometimes with data as it becomes available. My data featured in almost every UK national paper and is based on the figures from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and development) , although I am not sure that the formal report has been published as yet. As you quote the same source I presume it is impeccable .. This UK figure is (bar Luxembourg) apparently the highest in Europe , with Italy at 5% and Germany at 10%.   In terms of exporting doctors  the UK is second only to Germany as far as Europe is concerned.   Of course one can put various interpretations on this evidence. It would be interesting to know how many of the doctors we are exporting trained in the UK were also born here. Is the UK a medical transit camp  providing highly regarded qualification before moving on ? Perhaps with the added factor that it is easier to move on from the UK than from some places of birth.   I think I was presenting less an argument than an observation : hence my title. Clearly many of the newspapers will look to the rather facile question as to why are not self-sufficient as regards medical question whereas the wider question is : do we need to be? The reason I gave Poland as an example of the other extreme was to emphasise that having a totally endogenous work force might not always be ideal either. I felt that you were a bit on the defensive , I have no doubt that the NHS owes an enormous debt to doctors born (and often initially trained ) abroad and that scarcely needs stating , but misses some of the point. It is also that this group often provides the doctors of excellence. This is great news for UK medicine  high fliers in my era had to fight some awful prejudice if they decided not to emigrate. I do not think either of the consultants whom I went out of my way to choose this year was born in the UK and there is a third in the pipeline. 2 of my dentists whom I regarded very highly have come from Libya and female to boot !   Our high dependence on foreign born nurses at 22% is again I think a separate issue and raises the question of whether recruitment as now promoted is ethical  there are differences from the medical personnel born abroad but receiving higher professional training whom we then filch.   The figure I would like most to see is the % of the coming generation of doctors who do not have parents who were born in the UK. This could well be very high. My impression is that the Anglo-Saxon male is becoming less and less the norm in the profession for a whole variety of reasons and that is potentially a very good thing. It would be interesting to know what is happening in Scotland  except one might have to substitute something for the Anglo-Saxon prototype.-j08eyxg1bia1c7wpf142417g8qa3i85awozqw84flsczv0	sken	30/12/2015 4:51 PM	0	0
598	132	1	There are increasing numbers of foreign trained doctors in many countries. It is a general trend, in some countries more pronounced, in others less. Some of this trend is due to a higher rate of immigration of populations and moving from country to country. Another part is the influx of doctors that can't work at their native countries due to different circumstances, mostly economical( in Hungary a doctor earns a salary that cannot be considered suffucient to lead a normal economically balanced life). So people look for possibilities abroad. In some countries there is a shortage of doctors which is filled by the foreign dctors.   Some countries take in more freign doctors than others. Some are less popular targets for doctors to go there, be it economicl reasons or reasons that make it difficult to obtain a license to work at the specific country.	yoram chaiter	2/1/2016 10:35 AM	0	0

604	134	1	I find treating type 2 diabetes difficult. I really like finding a cure for patients and so much of modern medicine is treating surrogate measurements to reduce risk rather than trying to cure conditions. With more preventative medication elderly people tend to be on multiple medications and so the risk of side effects is higher.   I would probably ask the patient what he wanted. Did he have symptoms that troubled him or did he want to reduce his risks. I would ask him about his attitude to medication and whether he would accept side effects if they produced a significant reduction in risk from disabling illness and if medication was significantly lightly to reduce mortality   I have now retired from full time General Practice and I only do some GP locums in an OOH centre. I still very much enjoy the work, but I do miss some of the continuity of care. When I was a partner, if I had a worry with a diabetic patient had a partner who was very good with dealing with diabetic medications and I would have probably deferred to him. He unlike me was fairly keen on gliptins [DPP4] and would have probably gone for option 2.

The challenges of EU membership are widely enough recognised (without media nonsense about banana geometry) but we can't change it if we don't have a meangingful seat at the table.   However, my deepest concern is that the language and attitudes used by the Brexiters, especially the scapegoating and vilifying of immigrants, are only being normalised by this campaign. We may end up remaining but that won't change the fact that a large amount of people in this country have been whipped into a mess of anti-EU and anti-migrant sentiment -- and will be very, very bitter.-84	jeffnevil	9/6/2016 5:29 PM	0	0
616	135	1	I heard the excellent Nick Robinson (Today, and previously the BBC's chief political reporter) talking about the Referendum Campaign on the Radio4. Sorry, can't recall which programme. He was as concerned as the above on the poor quality of debate and at the wild statistics that were being rattled.  He said that the Media, and especially the BBC, was well-equipped to criticise the inflated and demolish the ridiculous, but could not, for fear of losing their impartiality.   If it was the BBC who threw out the Brexit claim of Biblically enormous sums being paid to Europe every week, or that it was foreign (=European) rapists who were terrorising the womenfolk of England, they would lose they precious neutrality.  Not in those words, of course - he was too diplomatic.   This is a problem, and while I hesitate to invoke previous demagogues (especially those with toothbrush moustaches in the style of Charlie Chaplin) it is the same as the Big Lie, one so enormous that anyone receiving it will think, no one could say that if it wasn't true, and so believe it!   That style of politics was unimpeded by the Media of the time, which did not hold the tenets of impartial reporting that our Media do today.  Would that they had, but look!  Even our best journalists are determined to investigate and expose crooked Panamanian accountants, but allow the most blatently ridiculous statement by partial politicians to go, if not unchecked but uncriticised.  How can we free them to pursue political bias, while still keeping them neutral, and seen as neutral?   John-xe5bob1ib2cxib7vrhofb6l6a9s	John D	10/6/2016 9:40 PM	0	0
617	136	1	What would you do with a 45 YO complicated diabetic patient with diabetes since 1998 and creatinine level of 2.31 with hypertention that is not controlled by enalapril 40 mg per day, aldospiron 25 mg per day, bisoprolol 5 mg per day, he can not tolerate amlodipine because of leg edema. Please share your thoughts.	Yaron	22/5/2011 7:50 PM	0	0
618	136	1	Hello Yaron:      It looks like he has resistant hypertension secondary to diabetic nephropathy already in stage 3 to 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 3 to 4).        Salt is a very important issue in diabetic and CKD hypertension.        This is what I would try with her:        - Severe dietary salt restriction.    - Get rid of any Anti-Inflammatory drugs.    - Keep the Enalapril on top of the 40 mg/day dose.    - Add Furosemide 80 to 160 mg in two divided doses per day in addition to the spironolactone.    - Change the Nevibolol for Carvedilol, just because of my larger personal experience with carvedilol and also for a higher dose range with Carvedilol (I could begin with, for example, 6,25 mg twice a day increasing up to 12,5 or even 25 mg twice a day, in just a few weeks).    - I would definetely give another chance to amlodipine, 10 mg at bedtime. Together with High dose furosemide, things can get better.      And so, He would be on 4 classes of anti-hypertensive drugs, with nice doses:   Enalapril, Amlodipine, Carvedilol, Furosemide, and Spironolactone.      Hope it helps,      All best,      Joey-it3a6czb16cyeua	Joey Rio	23/5/2011 2:06 AM	0	0
619	136	1	Hallo Joy Thank you for your important comments. The patient (he) is not on NSAIDs. He is on low salt diet. I was concerned about the combination of enalapril and aldospiron in CKD because of the possibility of hyperkalemia. Aren't you? What would be your reco for kalium blood level monitoring schedule? He has microalbuminoria of 1.7 gr/l and his microalbumin/creatinine ratii is 3.8 - dose it make a difference in your management ?	Yaron	23/5/2011 4:51 AM	0	0
620	136	1	Well .... its understood that other causes of resistant BP such as renal art. stenosis, are ruled out by detail lab and imaging work up.Presently, whats the status of her diabetes? HbA1C estimates? Is she on any anti-diabetic drugs and or OHA?Whats her current Insulin portocol? I would first stabilize blood glucose ... mainly with insulin ...naturally multiple regime.For BP to be <130/90 ... ACE, ARB, (with close monitoring of electrolytes) CCB, B-blokers, diurteics, with low salt and low protein diet are indicated - as tolerated to maximum doses. Other complicating co-morbidities like anaemia, hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, etc. should be treated with erythropoietin, calcium, vit D. Some advocate advance vascular access - about 3 to 6 months in advance of anticipated dialysis - for replacement therapy.	csm@csm	23/5/2011 5:12 AM	0	0
621	136	1	Hallo csm@csm Thak you so much for your comment.  The patient has PVD and underwent amputations of 1 and 3 fingets of his left leg in the last 3 years. Therefore his family physicians thought about renal artery stenosis and conducted duplex of the renal arteries which was normal. Would you be satisfied by this test or add other tests and which ones? The patient was till lately on gluben+metformine which were stopted and replaced by insulin lantus 28 IU every evening and Apidra 8 iU before lunch. On this mewly started regiment the HBA1C was lowered from 11.3 to 9.2. His glucose level in the morning is 140-180, befor lunch 200-250 and before dinner 230-260. I saw him for the first time yesterday in my volunteer diabetes consulting clinic in a low socioeconomic area. I instructed him to measure blood glucose 5 times daily and to elevate the lantus by 2 units every 3 days till morning blood glucose is lower than 140. I addaed apidra before breakfest and before dinner 8-12 units according to the glucose level and hopefully in 3 months he will be balanced. I decided not to push in the first meeting and although his hemoglobin was 9.8 I did notcstart erythropoetin calcium and vitamin D. I will consider it next session after I will be sure I gained compliance for anti diabetic antihypertensive multidrugs regiment. Concerning vascular access - he is not ready yet... But It will be an issue in the next few months. Thank you again for your comments and developing the case description. Anyone has more thoughts? Suggestions? Disagreements? questions that might help to suggest the best practice for this poor 45 YO patient? Comments are welcome.	Yaron	23/5/2011 6:03 AM	0	0
622	136	1	Hello Yaron . A significant point that I have noted in your comments above is that this middle-aged patient, with chronic disease burden, is from low socio-economic strata. Against such a background, I would work up this case as best suits patients autonomy and beneficence, including financial constraints, and not by the dictates of the EBM or guidelines, which will certainly be a tall order to follow for this poor patient. I strongly believe in the concept of patient-centered approach, and I certainly appreciate your approach  not to push things at first meeting till you are certain of compliance with drug regime. And based on similar logic, I suppose, I will plan investigations, if they add value to his management.  With a history of PVD / amputation, one may like to rule out PAN, or vasculitis, by tests such as ANCA, and a biopsy; but again, as the disease is well advanced, will it be beneficial? If positive, again the role of steroids / immuno modulators has to be assessed, because of the added immunodeficiency risk and upset diabetic control. I would prefer to just manage his lipid profile a bit more aggressively with Atorvastatin only ( for other statins dose adjustment is recommended, depending on creatinine clearance and GFR), add cilostazol, aspirin, PPI, in a step-wise regime, as best tolerated by him; but the cornerstone of his management is  a fairly well glycemic control with insulin. Your plan of Lantus insulin with graded dose of Apidra rapid insulin as per blood glucose values is fine, and FBG values around 100 and PP / random around 150 must be targeted without hypos; however, variable response to insulin as CKD progresses needs careful monitoring. If the total dose of insulin is escalating, then a small dose of glipizide (which dose not need dose adjustment in renal insufficiency), is a good option. Although FDA has permitted gliptins  Onglyza- in moderate to severe renal impairment, including ESRD, its high cost is a deterrent in this particular patient.  As for anti-hypertensives  beta-blockers should be excluded as there is h/o PVD; ace/arb with loop diuretics, and since he can not tolerate CCB due to pedal edema, well titrated alfa-blockers and centrally acting 2-adrenoceptor agonists may play a positive role in controlling resistant hypertension. Just a bit more counselling with respect to their side effects will enhance his cooperation in drug-dosage adherence.  Another point that I must state is that - over here, many patients, poor or rich alike , take varieties of herbal products containing heavy metals for many diseases ( IHD, DM, arthritis, cirrhosis of liver, HIV, CKD, etc) in the hope of a magic cure. And unless you question them directly, this goes unnoticed, and the truth comes out when its too late for some remedy. So, this aspect has to be probed, especially in the early stages of consultation.  With all the tools that we presently have to deal with CKD with DM and hypertension, its possible to delay further renal deterioration, and to achieve goal, whole-hearted physician-patient relationship is extremly important.-q05f8mm5aaa78fzeq3392hu9367aeyapp3ey79cpkb2wqvlh55c5w3c060	csm@csm	23/5/2011 1:18 PM	0	0

Comments are welcome.Posted by YaronDears Yaron and Csm:You are right about the dangers with Hyperkalemia. High dose Furosemide should antagonize that as long as the patient has enough diuresis and serum creatinine keeps below 3.0. Any way K should be closely monitored. But perhaps espirolactone could be left away from his treatment at this point. But I think high dose furosemide is a must for him.As Csm suggested, I also think, Atorvastatin is really a good shot for him.Regarding his Peripheral Vascular Disease, the first generation beta-blockers are clearly contra-indicated, but that is not the case for the newer ones as carvedilol.Now, let-me call you both the attention for this interesting recent article written by a nephrologist from the United States about diabetic patients with Chronic Kidney Disease, using much higher than usual doses of Lisinopril (up to 80mg/day) in single daily administrations. The authors obtained a measurably good effect on blood pressure and albuminuria. But Potassium should be closely monitored.I found it a really interesting and new way of treating those high-risk diabetic patients such as yours. The abstract Follows.Hope it helps. All Best. Joey.Journal of Investigative MedicineISSN:1081-5589(C) 2010 American Federation for Medical ResearchEffective Antihypertensive Strategies for High-Risk Patients WithDiabetic Nephropathypg. 950-956DOI: 10.231/JIM.0b013e3181ff46a5AB Aim: Clinical guidelines recommend blood pressure (BP) lowering and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition to slow kidney disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy. This study's purpose was to determine whether an antihypertensive regimen including a maximally dosed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor could safely achieve target BP in indigent, predominantly minority patients with this disease. Methods: We studied 81 hypertensive adults (52% Hispanic and 31% African American) with nephropathy attributed to type 1 or 2 diabetes during the run-in period of a randomized controlled trial. The subjects received lisinopril titrated to 80 mg daily and additional antihypertensives to target a systolic BP (SBP) lower than 130 mm Hg. Blood pressure and serum potassium level were measured weekly, and a 4-gram sodium diet was prescribed. The primary outcome variable was SBP change from screening to randomization. Success in achieving SBP goal, change in urine albumin-creatinine ratio, hyperkalemia (serum potassium >=5.5 mmol/L) and hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg) were also analyzed. Results: The median SBP decreased from 144 to 133 mm Hg (median change, -9.6%.) Fifty-eight (71%) achieved goal SBP during run-in. The median UACR decreased from 206.8 to 112.7 mg/mmol (median change, -42.7%). The UACR reduction correlated with SBP reduction. Seventeen subjects experienced hyperkalemia responsive to dietary/medical management. Two subjects experienced hypotension responsive to medication adjustments. Conclusion: A regimen using a maximally dosed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is safe and effective for achieving BP goal in high-risk, predominantly minority patients with diabetic nephropathy. Implementing this regimen necessitates close monitoring of serum potassium level. (C) 2010 American Federation for Medical Research-3z6kk7atfl	Joey Rio	24/5/2011 4:51 AM	0	0
624	136	1	Well scholars! I am late enterant. So much discussed so beautifully. Yaron has given the history in installments which is good.I think we must set two goals first in this patient.Desired: HBA1C = < 6.5 % Fasting = < 100 mg/dl Random = < 140 mg/dl B.P = < 110/80 Hb = 9.2 gm; good enough.In assessment of renal function Creatinine clearance should be the guide. One good point about prognosis: This patient still has lot of renal reserve as so much inuslin is being needed.I would have gone with combination of regular and NPH insulin cosidering socioeconomic class.About antihypertensives/Pedal edema is harmless. Secondly while adding frusamide and already being used ACE, it should not be limiting factor, although tachycardia can be a discomfort.I would go with following regime;Frosamide 40 mg 8 hourlyAmlodipine 5 mg 12 hourlyRamipril 10 mg bidCarvidolol (Nebivolol) 12.5 bidIf this does not achieve target BP then I have something else in store.-09yaaaaaqaaaaawaaaaavaaaaaeaaaaaaalaaaaadaaaaaa	ranasaleem	25/5/2011 9:44 AM	0	0
625	137	1	Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 19802013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013   The Lancet, Early Online Publication, 29 May 2014 doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8Cite or Link Using DOI  Summary   Background   In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 34 million deaths, 39% of years of life lost, and 38% of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 19802013.   Methods   We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).   Findings   Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 288% (95% UI 284293) to 369% (363374) in men, and from 298% (293302) to 380% (375385) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 238% (229247) of boys and 226% (217236) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 81% (7786) to 129% (123135) in 2013 for boys and from 84% (8188) to 134% (130139) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50% in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down.   Interpretation   Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.      COMMENT: While we in the West were wringing our hands about the increase in overweight and obesity in our own countries, we or atleast I for one did not appreciate just how widespread and pervasive this epidemic was. Given this worldwide increase and acceleration of obesity, the calculations for future prevalence of obesity must surely be underestimates. As if the data presented were not depressing enough, the statement that no country has yet succeeded in reversing this trend is an indication of the uphill battle we have before us.-086f41cjgkf0241ata5a41inadigdwgdigd0igdrgd9nfcigd4afcigd082106wtwa7tua8au2j3a0pta5b	diabetesMD	9/6/2014 8:36 AM	0	0

627	137	1	Yes, the CDC reported a similar decrease in 2-5-year-olds in the US. And sugary pop consumption is also decreasing in that age group. Let's hold our breath. Here's the abstract:   Prevalence of Childhood and Adult Obesity in the United States, 2011-2012  JAMA. 2014;311(8):806-814. doi:10.1001/jama.2014.732.   ABSTRACT  Importance More than one-third of adults and 17% of youth in the United States are obese, although the prevalence remained stable between 2003-2004 and 2009-2010.  Objective To provide the most recent national estimates of childhood obesity, analyze trends in childhood obesity between 2003 and 2012, and provide detailed obesity trend analyses among adults.  Design, Setting, and Participants Weight and height or recumbent length were measured in 9120 participants in the 2011-2012 nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.  Main Outcomes and Measures In infants and toddlers from birth to 2 years, high weight for recumbent length was defined as weight for length at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. In children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific CDC BMI-for-age growth charts. In adults, obesity was defined as a BMIgreater than or equal to30. Analyses of trends in high weight for recumbent length or obesity prevalence were conducted overall and separately by age across 5 periods (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012).  Results In 2011-2012, 8.1% (95% CI, 5.8%-11.1%) of infants and toddlers had high weight for recumbent length, and 16.9% (95% CI, 14.9%-19.2%) of 2- to 19-year-olds and 34.9% (95% CI, 32.0%-37.9%) of adults (age-adjusted) aged 20 years or older were obese. Overall, there was no significant change from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012 in high weight for recumbent length among infants and toddlers, obesity in 2- to 19-year-olds, or obesity in adults. Tests for an interaction between survey period and age found an interaction in children (P=.03) and women (P=.02). There was a significant decrease in obesity among 2- to 5-year-old children (from 13.9% to 8.4%; P=.03) and a significant increase in obesity among women aged 60 years and older (from 31.5% to 38.1%; P=.006).  Conclusions and Relevance Overall, there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. Obesity prevalence remains high and thus it is important to continue surveillance.-hw1elcxa9ong2imh70awy670436dya75ebrb8hb6h	diabetesMD	9/6/2014 10:22 AM	0	0
628	137	1	As a student back in the 1960s I was taught time and again about the problems of lifestyle and obesity with examples from the UK and elsewhere in the world. The UK now accepts that 10% of our budget will go on obesity - more than the entire budget for General Practice. The epidemic has been arising fairly remorselessly and has been well publicised. We should stop thinking that we will be able to make appreciable inroads now and plan on how much extra tax will be needed for this. We will of course wrap it up by saying it is for extra nurses or whatever.   Society has just acquiesced and adapted even to the point of disadvantaging those who have tried to maintain a BMI under 25. Diabetologists are not blameless - perhaps they should have been flagging up these problems politically rather than just trying to grab resources for care of the end disease? What will they do if everyone becomes thin (as we now refer to those with a normal BMI) overnight.... are there enough with Type 1 to keep them all in employment? As things are they need have no worries.-xj2	sken	9/6/2014 3:18 PM	0	0

630	137	1	Lets carry that cigarette comparison farther. When I was growing up the most popular radio and later TV shows were sponsored by tobacco companies. I especially remember Your Hit Parade sponsored by Lucky Strike cigarettes and the Arthur Godfrey show sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes, but there were many more. Here is what the Wikipedia says about that era:   The decades in the 20th century prior to World War II consisted primarily of full page, color magazine and newspaper advertisements. Many companies created slogans for their specific cigarettes and also gained endorsements from famous men and women. Some advertisements even contained children or doctors in their efforts to sway new customers to their specific brand. Much of these advertisements sought to make smoking appear fashionable and modern to men and women. Also, since the health effects of smoking weren't entirely proven at this time, the only real opposing argument to smoking was made on moral grounds. However, there were still a substantial amount of doctors and scientists who believed there was a health risk associated with smoking cigarettes.[6] During World War II, cigarettes were included in American soldier's C-rations since many tobacco companies sent the soldiers cigarettes for free. Cigarette sales reached an all time high at this point, as cigarette companies were not only able to get soldiers addicted to tobacco, but specific brands also found a new loyal group of customers as soldiers who smoked their cigarettes returned from the war.   So what happened to change that? First, there was the science that culminated in the 1964 Surgeon Generals Report on Smoking and Health. The report although dated 1964 was actually available earlier. Our Chairman of Medicine, Dr. John Hickam, was on the panel. It may be hard to imagine today, but in the 1960s we smoked in our medical school classes and the projector lighted up the blue haze that surrounded us. Following the report virtually the entire class quit smoking as did the majority of physicians in the US.   It was nearly 20 years from that time until smoking became socially unacceptable to everyone except the 20% of hard cases, mostly lower income and education, that still smoke in the US. However, it would be an error to think that the success of smoking cessation programs was a matter of science and public health messages. The estimated $50 billion tobacco advertising budget dwarfed the public health message budget by a 100-fold.   It was only when the Attorneys General of the various states collaborated with the tort bar that the public health messages received adequate funding via billions of dollars in law suit settlements over the individual states medical expenses for caring for people with smoking-related diseases.   So there are two messages here for those of us concerned about the obesity epidemic. The first is that we need convincing science that the increase in obesity has causal entities that bear responsibility for the epidemic. Within the past few years there have been both scientific studies and lay publications that place the responsibility of this epidemic largely at the feet of the manufactured food industry. Among the most powerful is the book Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us by Michael Moss and the documentary film Super Size Me, a 2004 documentary directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock, an American independent filmmaker. Spurlock's film follows a 30-day period from February 1 to March 2, 2003 during which he ate only McDonald's food. The film documents this lifestyle's drastic effect on Spurlock's physical and psychological well-being, and explores the fast food industry's corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit.   The second is that we need to institute measures that make the manufacture and marketing of these manufactured foods increasing unprofitable, while also making their marketing increasingly socially unacceptable. This will take time and it will not be a short or linear process. Perhaps we need to revisit the Attorneys General strategy of taking to court those who make and sell these foods and make them pay for the resultant medical costs.   While I am not sure that we have the answers yet, we certainly are on our way the defining the question. Einstein is quoted as having said that if he had one hour to save the world he would spend fifty-five minutes defining the problem and only five minutes finding the solution.-c01jld1h95c8cxc3c7i4l0e7une2h8ipu9ba5yx93721kbmba6fq7a535ac1c4xd77	diabetesMD	10/6/2014 6:24 AM	0	0
631	137	1	"Many thanks diabetesMD. One of the crucial differences between smoking and obesity is that smokers paid for there health care whereas the obese simply expect others to pick up the bill. I remember the argument that the UK could not afford to ban smoking due to loss of revenue and people surviving longer.   I am surprised that so many were smoking in medical classes in the 1960s - it suggests an analogy with obese folk not facing up to the fact until someone tells them they are obese. I think in the UK smoking was already accepted medically as ""a bad thing"" by then. (One of my teachers was reported to have grabbed a packet of cigarettes from a patient and jumped on them). Officially until relatively late in the day , UK coroners might refuse to accept a death certificate blaming smoking. And we still behave with a 2-faced dishonesty that is mind -boggling , bearing in mind the current policies to oblige some other countries to allow tobacco to be pushed - those seen as non-western do not count when profits are concerned. It is all remarkably reminiscent of the old opium wars and selling weapons etc...   There are a number of reasons why doctors choose not to smoke - one is the simple self-centred approach about their own health. Others I thnk are concerned about setting an example. The latter to some extent extended to having alcohol at day-time meetings - this was first discouraged and then discontinued. We have remained very ambivalent about setting an example in terms of exercise and obesity. There are some very obese , very good doctors out there , but perhaps a simple policy that at some stage -say 20 years hence - morbid obesity would be seen as contrindication to a career in medical care , would not go amiss. And that should apply as of now to those who appear in the media talking about healthy lifestyles etc.. - particularly to those involved in running the health services.-xi4cv"	sken	10/6/2014 9:11 AM	0	0
632	137	1	Diabetes MD   Thanks for the valuable references and links on this and other topics. My memories of smoke-filled student days are similar to yours. Even the teachers smoked in classes. Speaking as someone who has never smoked, the bans on public place smoking here have greatlyenhanced life.   There isa disconnectbetween academic research and Government policies. If administrations are fighting change they demand unreasonable levels of proof but if, often for dubious reasons, certain policies are being pushed, the need for evidence can be waived. In the case of the NHS reforms this has been described as 'policy-based evidence making.'   I would suggest that evidence for the causes and effects of worldwide obesity is easily enough for national and global action. Few countries seem to be able to assess risk very effectively. Callanything a threat to national security and all other rights can be trampled but problems such as obesity that carry the same or higher real risks are treated very differently and we have discussedsome reasons for that.   Cynically, I guess you might say that the obesity epidemic is eventually going to be self-limiting because of its effects on mortality but the costs and misery on the way will be huge. I might have to check the source but I've been told that there are now more overweight than underweight people in the world. We therefore have the strange reality that, in a generation, the overriding problemof feeding the starving could be reversed. Countering myths might be oneplace to start. The problem is no longer one ofproducing enough food to feed the starving, it's oneofredistribution.-066brcvb1golm4c7ltilcf0r8hvesdyb4ap6a6c	Maxim	10/6/2014 10:36 AM	0	0
633	137	1	"Continuing the smoking issue I don't think many people are aware of just how long the link between smoking and ill health has been known and that campaigns to discourage smoking were in place long before the 1950s when the link between cancer and smoking was identified. Hitler hated tobacco smoking (despite once being a heavy smoker) and he banned smoking on trams, inside government buildings and whilst Wehrmacht soldiers were on duty. Whilst not linking smoking to cancer he once lamented that many good men have been lost to tobacco smoking. He also promised to end tobacco smoking in the military after the war.      The term passive smoking (Passivrauchen) was coined in Nazi Germany. Hitler personally gave financial support to the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren (Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research) at the University of Jena, headed by Karl Astel.Established in 1941, it was the most significant anti-tobacco institute in Nazi Germany.      Franz H. Mller in 1939 and E. Schairer in 1943 first used case-control epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers. In 1939, Mller published a study report in a reputed cancer journal in Germany which claimed that prevalence of lung cancer was higher among smokers.      Restrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products,enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression of masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.      Apart from public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology; specifically, the movement was influenced by concepts of racial hygiene and bodily purity. Nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for the master race to smoke and that tobacco consumption was equal to ""racial degeneracy"". The Nazis viewed tobacco as a ""genetic poison"". Racial hygienists opposed tobacco use, fearing that it would ""corrupt"" the ""German germ plasm"". Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a vice of the degenerates.      The Nazis claimed that the Jews were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects. The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews. Johann von Leers, editor of the Nordische Welt (Nordic World), during the opening ceremony of the Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren in 1941, proclaimed that ""Jewish capitalism"" was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across Europe. He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in Amsterdam, the principal European entry point of Nicotiana.      Here we are 70 years later still trying to discourage smoking. Whilst the Nazi regime was evil it is interesting to note their awareness of smoking being unhealthy, perhaps not linking it to cancer but using advertising to discourage smoking. However, after the war rates of smoking rose dramatically.

Cokes financial backing of the group, reported by The New York Times in August, prompted criticism that the company was trying to shape obesity research and stifle criticism of its products..   Public health authorities complained that Coke, the worlds largest producer of sugary beverages, was adopting tactics once used by the tobacco industry, which for decades enlisted experts to raise doubts about the health hazards of smoking. Last month, the University of Colorado School of Medicine said it would return a $1 million grant that Coca-Cola had provided to help start the organization.   .-w0080efc0	diabetesMD	2/12/2015 1:08 PM	0	0

FDA Warns of Heart-Failure Risk With Two Diabetes Drugs     Miriam E Tucker April05,2016           Add Other Topics       THE FDAANNOUNCEDTHAT NEW WARNINGS WILL BE ADDED TO THE LABELS OF THE TWO DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE4 (DPP-4) INHIBITOR DRUGS, CAUTIONING THAT THEY MAY INCREASE THE RISK FOR HEART FAILURE, PARTICULARLY IN PATIENTS WHO ALREADY HAVE CARDIOVASCULAR OR KIDNEY DISEASE.          ""Healthcare professionals should consider discontinuing medications containing saxagliptin and alogliptin in patients who develop heart failure and monitor their diabetes control,"" an FDA statement notes. ""If a patient's blood sugar level is not well-controlled with their current treatment, other diabetes medicines may be required.""      Combination products containing the two agents are also affected, including saxagliptin and metformin extended release (Kombiglyze XR, AstraZeneca ), alogliptin and metformin (Kazano, Takeda), and alogliptin and pioglitazone (Oseni, Takeda).      The move follows an FDA internalsafety reviewof two large cardiovascular-outcomes trials of patients with cardiovascular disease and a recommendation for the label revision by the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee during an April 2015 hearing.      At that meeting, the panel expressed greater concern about heart failure for saxagliptin than for alogliptin, but because the mechanism is not clear and the two belong to the same class, the majority opted to recommend the warning on both labels.      However, in the interim, a third large cardiovascular-outcomes trial with another DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin (Januvia, Merck), theTrial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin(TECOS), showed no signal of heart failure at all in type 2 diabetes patients who received the drug.  SAVOR and EXAMINE, Compared With TECOS      Results of the two studies that prompted the FDA safety review Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes MellitusThrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53(SAVOR-TIMI 53) andExamination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care(EXAMINE)  were first presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) meeting in 2013 and later published in theNew England Journal of Medicine.      In the saxagliptin trial, which included 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease, there was no overall risk for cardiovascular events, but there was a 27% increase (3.5% vs 2.8%) in the rate of the first event of hospitalization for heart failure and a potential increased risk for all-cause mortality. Risk factors included a history of heart failure or kidney impairment.      In EXAMINE, which included a total of 5380 patients, 3.9% of patients receiving drug were hospitalized for heart failure vs 3.3% of patients receiving placebo. Although the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.19), heart failure was not an end point of the study.      TheTECOS resultswith sitagliptin, the DPP-4 inhibitor that has been on the market for longest, were first presented at the ADA meeting last year and simultaneously published in theNew England Journal of Medicine; the absence of any heart-failure signal was confirmed witha deeper dive into the resultspresented at the ESC meeting in September 2015.

But urbanites are not the only ones turning away from the products created by big food companies. Eating habits are changing across the country and food companies are struggling to keep up.   General Mills will drop all artificial colors and flavors from its cereals. Perdue, Tyson and Foster Farm have begun to limit the use of antibiotics in their chicken.

Hersheys will begin to move away from ingredients such as the emulsifier polyglycerol polyricinoleate to simple and easy-to-understand ingredients like fresh milk from local farms, roasted California almonds, cocoa beans and sugar.   Those announcements reflect a new reality: Consumers are walking away from Americas most iconic food brands. Big food manufacturers are reacting by cleaning up their ingredient labels, acquiring healthier brands and coming out with a prodigious array of new products. Last year, General Mills purchased the organic pasta maker Annies Homegrown for $820 million  a price that was over four times the companys revenues, likening it to valuations more often seen in Silicon Valley.

It is now more correctly considered a serious carrier of free sugar, stripped of its natural fibers. Sales of packaged cereals, also heavily sugar-laden, are down over 25 percent since 2000, with yogurt and granola taking their place. Frozen dinner sales are down nearly 12 percent from 2007 to 2013.

646	142	1	A Protein In The Gut May Explain Why Some Can't Stomach Gluten   You are certainly in good company in being skeptical about all of the brouhaha about gluten free diets. But a recently conducted trial of people without Celiac disease who claimed to benefit symptomatically from a gluten free diet suggests that there may be a group of people who respond to gluten with marked increases in zonulin, a recently discovered protein that is markedly increased in persons with Celiac disease. Zonulin concentrations are increased whenever the gut recognizes ingested foodstuffs as toxic. Zonulins increase results in diarrhea and gut discomfort. It the trial reported four groups were studied: Celiac patients, people who self-identified as being gluten sensitive, irritable bowel patients and controls. Those subjects who self-identified as being gluten sensitive had substantial increases in zonulin following gluten ingestion in the range seen in Celiac disease. Those with irritable bowel had modest increases and controls had no increase. Much more needs to be done to substantiate zonulin as a marker of gut disease, but this is at least an interesting example of science offering a pathophysiologic explanation of what appears to be a food fad.  http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/12/09/459061317/a-protein-in-the-gut-may-explain-why-some-cant-stomach-gluten?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20151213&utm_campaign=bestofnpr&utm_term=nprnews-5r2b5niducxjsg4c816717	diabetesMD	13/12/2015 4:01 PM	0	0
647	142	1	"I think quite a few of us have felt for many years that there is an enormous grey area in gluten sensitivity and ""coeliac disease"". Host factors and high intake of gluten are both likely to be relevant , not to mention co-factors such as varying degrees of lactose intolerance. Gut doctors have been to blame for much of the normal/abnormal approach with an obsession with what is seen on biopsy , but better antibody screening - and this work on zonulin - may make some of them change their mind.   My impressionis is that food interests of this type are more likely to involve certain socio-economic groups for a variety of reasons but perhaps the USA is ahead of us in this. I am occasionally a bit shocked to see just how ignorant and unaware are some folk where one might have expected better understanding. In the UK we lag behind both the USA and Europe with few signs of improvement so far although it seems that our politicians may just be beginning to catch up on trans fats and possibly sugar. One would very much like to see some of the so called chefs in the UK giving a bit of information on the nutrition in their recommended meals which sometimes seem much more iniquitous than a MacDonalds , but I think add to UK complacency amongst the chattering classes.

650	143	1	On the 12th of November new guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease were published. [2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines. J Am Coll Cardiol 12 Nov 2013] They were the result of four years of deliberation by a joint panel of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology. The changes have been summarized in the BMJ [BMJ 2013;347:f6858]. Highlights of the guidelines can be summarized as follows:     The new risk assessment guideline uses a formula that is based on information easily collected in a primary care setting, such as age, cholesterol concentrations, blood pressure, smoking history, and diagnosis of diabetes. This information can then be entered into equations given in the guideline to create a risk score to guide patient counseling and, if warranted, treatment.    The risk factors used in the formula were age, smoking, high cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes. Unlike previous guidelines, which were based on data only from non-Hispanic white people, the new guidelines include equations that better represent the effect of risk factors for women and African Americans.    The panel also found that four markers may be helpful for patients in whom the need for treatment remained uncertain after evaluation by the guidelines risk equations: coronary artery calcium scores, C reactive protein concentrations, ankle brachial indices, and family history of premature cardiovascular disease.    The guideline on managing blood cholesterol identifies four major groups of people for whom moderate to high intensity treatment with statins is recommended: people who have known cardiovascular disease; those with a low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher; those aged 40-75 who have type 2 diabetes; and those aged 40-75 whose 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as estimated from the risk formulas provided in the report, is 7.5% or more.    The guideline on managing blood cholesterol identifies four major groups of people for whom moderate to high intensity treatment with statins is recommended: people who have known cardiovascular disease; those with a low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher; those aged 40-75 who have type 2 diabetes; and those aged 40-75 whose 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as estimated from the risk formulas provided in the report, is 7.5% or more. High intensity statin treatment would include regimens that in the clinical trials reviewed by the panel reduced LDL cholesterol concentrations on average by around 50% or more. Atorvastatin 40-80 mg a day would be one example of a high intensity regimen. Moderate intensity statin treatment would be regimens that lowered LDL cholesterol on average by around 30% to less than 50%. An example would be simvastatin 20-40 mg a day. The panel considered other cholesterol lowering drugs but found them to be not as effective as statins, said Neil J Stone, professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and chairman of the expert panel. Statins were chosen because their use has resulted in the greatest benefit and the lowest rates of safety issues, he said in a statement. Other drugs could be considered for patients who were intolerant of statins, he added.    The major and most controversial shift from current practice, the guideline does not recommend using combination therapy to try to reach specific LDL or non-HDL cholesterol concentration targets. Randomized controlled trials reviewed by the panel either compared fixed doses of statins with placebo or with untested controls or compared fixed doses of higher and lower intensity statins and were not designed to evaluate the effect of dose adjusted statin treatment to achieve pre-specified LDL or non-HDL cholesterol concentration targets.    COMMENTS: These new guidelines are already generating a great deal of interest and controversy. They were the subject of two above the fold articles in the New York Times. I am very interested in your comments on them. I would especially be interested in two questions:   For all, what changes in your approach and monitoring of statin treatment will result from these new guidelines?   For those physicians on statins, what changes, if any, will these result in your self-treatment?-l02jgcv7a43clh37bqctd3b156252zjwmabn	diabetesMD	15/11/2013 6:58 PM	1	0

652	143	1	This is getting complicated. According to an article to be published in Lancet and reviewed in the New York times yesterday, the risk estimator is based on old studies and may overestimate risk based on three new studies by as much as 100%. Based on that table virtually all black males over sixty-five should be on statins. The NHBLI, which first generated the guidelines, were told about this when they circulated a draft for comment at least a year ago. Their response was to withdrawal sponsorship by stating that it was not their responsibility to issue guidelines and turned over the responsibility to ACC and AHA, whio then issued the guidelines based on the same caculator. It is not clear at this point what happens next, but this situation certainly undermines the scientic basis for the risk calculator and by implication the decisions based upon it as to whether to treat a given individual.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/health/risk-calculator-for-cholesterol-appears-flawed.html?pagewanted=all-8q0a4oue1	diabetesMD	19/11/2013 5:58 PM	0	0
653	143	1	Hey, be fair... this is a brilliant business model. Think about those poor pharma companies that have to try and prop up profits lost through the move to generics.      Who wrote these guidelines? Who funded them? Answer those two questions and you're someway toward understanding that this has nothing to do with clinical medicine; it has everything to do with commerce.-43	RonL	19/11/2013 7:35 PM	0	0
654	143	1	In all cander that is a pretty cynical view and is not consistent with what is being reported. First, the initiial guideline draft including the risk caculator was developed by the NHLBi, hardly a apologist for industry. Second, the final guidelines were jointly issued by two prestigious professional associations, the American Heart Association and the American college of Cardiology. Third, the controversy is not about the value of the new guidelines. Dr. Paul M. Ridker and Nancy R. Cook, Sc.D., of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womens Hospital in their commentary published online in Lancet yesterday. stated quite clearly that they thought that the guidelines were an improvement. So what is the controversity? The risk calculator is based on studies that began 20 years ago. Three more recent studies, the Womens Health Study, the Physicians Health Study, and the Womens Health Initiative Observational Study, all show lower risks than the older studies. in Drs. Ridker and Cook's view the more recent data should have been used. In the view of the guideline committee they older studies should be used. Time will tell, but in either case the reason why they are called guidelines is because they are designed to guide, not dictate.-tz6avf8b9f1cun4a9dukzcxd581780ddia4a2	diabetesMD	20/11/2013 9:06 PM	0	0
655	143	1	Thanks Charles. These guidelines seem to reflect the evidence better. I am not familiar with the risk score used but that is something that needs to be adapted for each population I would suppose. The guidelines are moving still more towards individualising therapy.   Limiting the use in the older person is to be welcomed as the risk of harm from the medication (especially the common adverse effects of statins) is perhaps greater than the benefits that may come but only after nearly 10 years of use. I suppose immediately post-MI is excluded from this?   In people with diabetes we may still be using combination therapy but there is certainly no evidence for its routing use.

656	143	1	The evidence base is known to be powerful for simvastatin, at reducing vascular events. Some drugs do reduce LDL values but with no evidence of effectiveness on reduced vascular events, and are expensive.This part of the guidance is sensible therefore   The emphasis on familiy history is very important.   What seems odd is the use of 7.5% as a cut point. Is it really worth treating everyone with a risk of 8% with a statin? Walnuts, Olive oil, and gentle walking would be better.-p1	Felix	21/11/2013 4:41 PM	0	0
657	143	1	Nice op-ed article in the New York Times yesterday http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/opinion/statins-by-numbers.html?_r=0 The author states that the use of evidence based guidelines is superior to the former use of numbers that seem reassuring to both doctor and patient, but are not backed up my any evidence. He goes on to states that it should be up to the physicians and their patients to determine which cohort best describes the individual in making the decision as to initial treatment.-sf	diabetesMD	30/11/2013 6:24 PM	0	0
658	143	1	Also an editorila in our own BMJ echoes this opinion. below is the concluding paragraph.  Editorial  Target cardiovascular risk rather than cholesterol concentration  BMJ 2013; 347 doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f7110 (Published 27 November 2013)   Cite this as: BMJ 2013;347:f7110    In the end, the new guidelines are worthy of admiration. It is remarkable that an expert writing group, steeped in the dogma of cholesterol treatment targets, could dispassionately evaluate the evidence and reach a conclusion that was such a brave and wise departure from current practice. We still need to resolve how best to calculate risk and in which populations. We also need to move past the idea that patients and doctors should defer to thresholds for treatment and develop tools that will facilitate shared decisions about prevention strategies. Nevertheless, the advances in this guideline should be acknowledged. It will probably take some time before these new concepts can be fully understood and incorporated into practice. But at least in the United States the approach to preventing atherosclerotic heart disease and stroke is on a more evidence based course. Patients will be the beneficiaries when we translate these concepts into proper new practices.-s76	diabetesMD	30/11/2013 6:36 PM	0	0
659	143	1	In Response to Re: New Cardiovascular guidelines markedly depart from current thinking on LDL-cholesterol outcomes:   Hey, be fair... this is a brilliant business model. Think about those poor pharma companies that have to try and prop up profits lost through the move to generics.      Who wrote these guidelines? Who funded them? Answer those two questions and you're someway toward understanding that this has nothing to do with clinical medicine; it has everything to do with commerce.    Posted by RonL   I would have to agree. The new guidelines extend the number of patients even further to get a larger proportion of the population onto statins.However, this is probably not a case driven by the improved profit to be extracted from off-patent drugs [which menas that as the price is lower more have to be sold to make the same income]. The new guidelines are driven by true believers of the faith of low cholesterol.   There is also a problem because the risk score used has been shown not to be well-calibrated against reality: i.e. it predicts an event rate twice as high as actually occurs in the population.   To be fair there is a lot of evidence that the lower LDL goes the better. From the JUPITER trial we know that if cholesterol is < 1.3 mmol/L (50mg/L), the outcome was better than in teh patients with LDL higher than that cut off. Newer agents are working towards LDL at about 0.5 mmol/L.   The real question is whether this will provide useful benefit. At current cut offs NNT to prevent an event is quite large. To go down to even lower cholesterol will make it ridiculoiusly high.   Personally, I think Risk fatigue sets in: We all have to die of something anf if we remove all other risks, it is likely to be something unpleasant that gets us in the end [famine and over-population].-8r1cz9	TimReynolds	4/12/2013 7:06 AM	0	0

673	145	1	Pinetree   Thedebate on antibiotic use and resistance often ignores the very real difficulties, as you imply,of deciding between bacterial and viral infections in individual patients.   Your first question was whether it was sensible to check the white cell count and/or ESR (CRP is as good and cheaper in these circumstances). It's only worth doing any of these tests if decisions about management depend on the results and I'm not sure they do in this particular example. Certainly the white count and CRP can be elevated in bacterial upper respiratory infections as well as in pneumonia. Even if not raised in viral infections it's so common for bacterial infection to follow in these circumstances that to test oncecould be unhelpful. Perhaps someone could tell us for sure but is green/yellow sputum reallya common feature in pneumonia? Physical signs including localised crepitations or otherfeatures of consolidation can help but radiography isprobably underused. The decision about antibiotic use presumably hinges more on the whole picture than on a blood test alone. I can't see that there could be any real criticism of a doctor whoconsidered prescribing anantibiotic for the example you describe.   You seem to want to avoid culture of the sputum but couldn't that be the most logical test to guide treatment in a patient who has more than a trivial illness, particularly if they are in any of the categories where the organisms might be less usual ones?   'Probably viral' can be used indiscriminately when there's pressure not to use antibiotics; vague terms such as 'viral pleurisy' can be frankly misleading as well as preventing diagnosis of much more likely and important causes.-4m8bxdrdaa8l5fzeyfta7ete8bt0i1cz	Maxim	27/2/2016 2:00 PM	0	0

676	146	1	The article below appeared in the Endgames section of the BMJ a few years ago. I'll post the answer in a few days.   A 14 year old girl presented to her local hospital with a three week history of progressively worsening cough, fever, and poor appetite, which had not responded to a week of oral antibiotics.   On examination she had a temperature of 38C, was pale, not clubbed, and her oxygen saturations were 95% in air. There was a dull note on percussion, with reduced air entry on auscultation in the right upper zone of the chest, and no added sounds. The rest of the systemic examination was normal.   At admission, blood tests showed haemoglobin 109 g/L (reference range 105-135), white blood cell count 12.7106cells/L (6.0-18), neutrophils 7.65106cells/L (2.0-6.0), C reactive protein 33 mg/L (0-5), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 116 mm in the first hour (10).

687	148	1	Are you waiting patiently for the new NICE asthma guideline? You'll be waiting a bit longer, after NICE decided today to delay the release of the guidelinewhile theyassess the impact it will have on routine clinical practice.   The draft guideline from Januarytook the controversial direction of removing the trial of treatment option from previous BTS/SIGN versions of the guidelines, instead encouraging GPs to carry out tests of airway hyper-responsiveness, such as FeNO and Mannitol challenge, in primary care.   GP bodies have responded with their concerns over monetary and time costs, as well as the requirement for re-training in technical and interpretative skills required to carry out these tests in primary care.   We got rid of oral steroid trials many years ago (everyone feels better on 2 weeks of steroids), but the trial of inhaled therapy was often very helpful, I found. Perhaps the reasoning was to minimise the number of patients who get left on ICS long term, without actually having asthma, but adherence rates being as they are, it seems unlikely to be a major issue in the real world.   We continue to wait for the guidelines.  But I'd rather see a new COPD guideline first.-5n5a5dk5d8az9cg	DundeeChest	14/9/2015 4:42 PM	0	0

692	150	1	"This paper is interesting. We've thought for a long time that emphysema on a CT scan is a bad thing - but more recent evidence from meta-analyses suggested that CT emphysema doesn't respond the same way as microscopic emphysema. Perhaps we should have known that - case series have shown that large bullae caused by cannabis smoking can be asymptomatic. This study suggests that the incidental finding of CT emphysema does make a big difference to COPD outcomes in the future.    Airway thickening has a large affect on future outcomes in this study, a hazard ratio of  />5 is impressive. But there's no link with fullly fledged bronchiectasis. This is odd. Bronchiectasis patients do more badly than simple COPD, if they're colonised with bacteria, particularly pseudomonas or staph. But, we know that there's a diffierence betwee the radiological finding of bronchiectasis, and the clinical syndrome of bronchiectasis - patients with traction bronchiectasis, for example, don't behave in teh same manner as patients with chronic bronchial sepsis and bronchiectatic change on a CT. So perhaps here the patients with ""bronchiectasis"" have only the radiological changes, not the clinical syndrome.      We're often criticised, as a speciality, for requesting too many scans. But when we scan patients, we find things, and this study shows that these findings are useful for prognostication.-wl0b0ivepk3bn1k8m6d7"	DundeeChest	27/8/2015 12:40 AM	1	0

701	154	1	"By Amy Orciari Herman  Edited by David G. Fairchild, MD, MPH, and Lorenzo Di Francesco, MD, FACP, FHM  Use of intravenous corticosteroids might lead to better outcomes among patients hospitalized with severe community-acquired pneumonia and high inflammatory responses, a JAMA study suggests.  Some 120 adults with severe pneumonia and C-reactive protein levels above 150 mg/L at admission were randomized to receive IV methylprednisolone (0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours) or placebo for 5 days, beginning within 36 hours of admission. All patients also received antibiotics.  The primary outcome  a composite of treatment failure endpoints  occurred less often with steroids versus placebo (13% vs. 31% of patients). This difference was due to a reduction in radiographic progression at 35 days with methylprednisolone. In-hospital mortality did not differ between the groups.  The authors write, ""If replicated, these findings would support the use of corticosteroids as adjunctive treatment in this clinical population."" An editorialist calls for a ""definitive study ... to confirm that less radiographic progression does in fact lead to lower mortality.""

I remember attending the ATS in 2004, going to a session on high dose and low dose steroids in sepsis - the consensus of the expert panel was that steroids had no place in sepsis, either high or low dose, early or late. Since then, we've seen spot cortisol testing, then short synacthen testing, and now high CRP as a trigger for giving steroids in sepsis, in this case due to pneumonia.

704	154	1	My apologies, Joey, for my very late response!   My excuse is that D2D used to send me an email copy of a personal message, but didn't this time (and may not at others), and I forget to look at my PMs.   I've raised the first with the D2D admin and the second with the 'attention cells' in my thalamus.   New readers, start here: Etomidate is an intravenous anaesthetic agent that is particularly free of haemodynamic side-effects.  It was used in an infusion to provide sedation for ventilated ICU patients, until their relatively poor survival was noticed, and the drug's effect of completely inhibiting the steroid response to stress was discovered.  But this was thought to be a function of the duration of the infuson, and it was still used for induction of anaesthesia, especially in unstable patients.   More recently http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10460557?dopt=Abstract&holding=f1000,f1000m,isrctn it was found that a single dose inhibited the adrenals for up to 24 hours.  As we now have suitable alternatives, such as ketamine and propofol, etomidate has fallen out of use in critical care.  Strangely there are still people using it as if this had never been known before http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22967694   This review article from 2012 http://ccforum.com/content/16/4/227 deals fully with the question as a debate.  It finds that the actual effect on survival or recovery of a single etomidate dose, for induction, has never been trialled, so that the drug may be avoided unfairly. But in the prescence of acceptable alternatives, I think it would be difficult to get such a trial past an ethical committee! Certainl;y I haven't used it for a very long time.

In 1903 at the University of Lyons, Alexis Carrel was ridiculed because he mentioned that a Tuberculosis patient he attended, had been cured by prayer. The response of the Dean of Faculty was so cold that he had no choice except to leave the Faculty. Eventually he joined the Rockefeller Institute. There he received a Nobel Prize in 1912.

It promises to stop cancer growth with a a protein, the epidermal growth factor (EGF), which stimulates the growth of cells, naturally found in the body, but cancerous tumors stimulate the body produce too much of. This causes the tumor to multiply and grow. Once vaccinated, EGF, and other compounds encourages the immune system to produce antibodies against EGF. This prevents tumors from getting bigger, but doesn't directly attack them.   Sounds promising?-04r4	Juan Zambon	12/5/2015 11:14 PM	0	0

Lung ultrasound can detect pneumothorax and pulmonary edema, but limited data exist to quantify its accuracy for diagnosing pneumonia. In a prospective study, investigators compared lung ultrasound to chest computed tomography (CT) and chest x-ray among adult patients presenting with unexplained respiratory symptoms to an academic emergency department in Italy.CT served as the gold standard for diagnosis of an infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Patients were enrolled when a CT scan was planned. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed within 3 hours of the CT scan by either emergency physicians or internists, and chest x-ray was performed at the discretion of the treating physician.During the 8-month study period, 285 patients underwent CT and ultrasound, and, of these, 190 also had a chest x-ray. Chest CT was positive for pneumonia in 87 patients. Sensitivity for diagnosing pneumonia was significantly higher with ultrasound than x-ray (81% vs. 64%), while specificities were statistically similar (94% and 90%)	Mukhtar Ali	15/5/2015 6:47 PM	0	0

It's no surprise that CXR isn't very sensitive for pneumonia, in comparison to CT, though. The CXR is only good for looking at the parts of the lung that the CXR can show - pneumonia often missed behing the heard, beind both diaphragms, and in the apices.

The spray  a combination of the anticholinergic tiotropium bromide and the long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) olodaterol  is indicated for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, but not acute deterioration of COPD or asthma.  Approval was based, in part, on trials of some 5000 patients with COPD. Lung function improved in those treated with the combination drug compared with patients given tiotropium or olodaterol alone.  The spray shouldn't replace treatment with a rescue inhaler. Like other LABAs, it will carry a boxed warning about the increased risk for asthma-related death. Common side effects include back pain, cough, and nasopharyngitis.

746	160	1	The question 'Is fertility a human right?' Is not, in my view capable of being answered. The question most often posed in this field is, 'is there a right to a baby', or to infertility treatment, or to successful infertility treatment? The obvious answer is no, because all rights have a correlative duty, and there is no duty on any person or on the health service or on researchers to ensure that someone else has a baby. Even between married persons, there is no duty to cooperate in fertility. The marital rape exemption has been abolished, and in general the father or husband has no say in whether the mother of his child has an abortion or not. A wife cannot demand fertile intercourse; parenthood is, or should be, a matter of agreement, negotiation or at least tolerance. We know from our study of infertility treatment, there is no assurance that any one of us can ever be guaranteed by medicine a baby of our own. Is there then a right to enable everyone to access all available fertility treatment in any circumstances?      After the introduction of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law by the 1998 Act, everything is different. Broadly speaking, it elevates the rights and aspirations of the individual over legislation that was originally designed to suit largely only the public and the executive good. It permeates our written and unwritten law; it tips the scales of justice even where an older British statute had already attempted, through nuanced drafting, to balance the rights of the individual versus society. And so in the field of infertility, where the interface between individual desires and public health and ethics is particularly intimate, it has a substantial impact on the application of the infertility laws, and one that is not always expected.      Article 8 of the Human Rights convention grants the right to respect for private and family life. Article 12 grants the right to marry and found a family within national law. Article 14 declares that there should be no discrimination on any ground in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention. We should remember the historical background against which these rights were drafted (as John and others note). They were drafted in the aftermath of the Second World War and express, inter alia, the distaste for enforced sterilisation measures and prohibition of marriage between classes of persons that were features of the war and other systems of conflict and dictatorship since then. My view is that Article 12 really means that society as a whole should not prevent individuals from procreating within the legal structure of that country. This does not help us to interpret the complicated issues that can arise in relation to fertility treatment today, most of which would have been beyond the ken of the drafters.      In a civilised society there is no right to procreate at will. A regulatory system like ours maintains the basics of reproductive autonomy, for example, the right to consent and to refuse, the right to avoid reproduction as well as access to the technology as democratically distributed, and abortion. There is no free for all in the societies that we consider advanced. They regulate, for example, the age of marriage and consent to intercourse, abortion and incest.      Logically there can be no right to infertility treatment. It is too artificial a procedure to be in any way counted as a natural right or one essential to life, any more than one can have a right to good health and all possible treatment at any cost within a national health service. No patient can ever be guaranteed successful medical treatment because nature has the last word still: we can only contemplate a promise of access as determined in a democratic society without unlimited medical resources. Where the facilitating of pregnancy has to include third parties beyond the confines of husband and wife (hardly private), then accountability and medical ethics must contribute to the decision, because it has a knock-on effect for all treatments of the infertile and others.      In general, to press for a 'right' must mean that existence without that right is a blighted and uncomfortable existence. In a society where many choose to remain childless and where availability of contraception and abortion was counted in the 1960s as one of women's triumphs and, indeed, human rights, it is impossible to argue that life without a baby is a condition for which there must be a remedy at all costs. One of the difficult aspects of the HFEA was to put across the message and create the policies whereby, at one and the same time, potential patients secured reasonable access to infertility treatment (a battle with the NHS has yet to be seriously fought), while protecting childless women from the image of themselves as defective vessels needing expensive medicine to make them whole.      One particular area that has caused great concern in the UK and around the world is the rights of prisoners to have access to IVF/AI:      The cases on prisoners' rights illustrate the dilemmas posed by human rights to fertility, albeit not decided under the HFE legislation.  In 1995 Dickson was convicted of murder for kicking a drunken man to death, and sentenced to life imprisonment. While serving his sentence, he began a penpal relationship with Lorraine, who was serving time for benefit fraud and already had 3 children. They were married after her release (note that British law does not generally prevent marriage of prisoners - but does block their procreational activities). Dickson was due for release in 2009, by which time Lorraine would be over 50 and unable to conceive naturally (the court was told). The couple's application for AI was rejected; they complained to the High Court and Court of Appeal that their rights to family and private life, to marry and found a family were being denied, but they lost. The ECHR gave judgment in 2004 (Dickson v UK, ECHR 18/4/06 App.44362/04)). The European judges were clear in denying the right of a prisoner and his wife to reproductive technologies for childbearing while he was incarcerated. The argument that society allows children to be born to single parents in poor circumstances was not regarded as sufficient to entitle the prisoner to achieve something similar. This was because the state was being asked to become an active accomplice and participant in the conception. 'I believe a responsible state to be right to require of itself standards higher than those beyond its control in the free procreation market', said Judge Bonello. The court paid attention to the fact that the couple had not yet experienced normal living together and that the circumstances in which the child might be born would not be good.      To general surprise, the Grand Chamber of the European Court, consisting of 17 judges, allowed the appeal by the Dickson (albeit that by 2007 he had been moved to an open prison, was allowed home visits and Lorraine was 49) and awarded them damages for deprivation of their human rights. The Court held that Art. 8, the right to private and family life, was engaged and included respect for the decision to become parents. Prisoners retained their human rights on imprisonment and any restriction of them must be justified in each case, and not dismissed because in general they would offend public opinion. The competing interests of the state and the parties had not been properly weighed by the British authorities, said the Court, nor had the issue of proportionality of interference with the prisoners' rights, so a blanket refusal of AI amounted to a breach of Art. 8. Little attention seemed to be paid to the article of English law that was so important in the court below, and that dominates our family law, namely that the welfare of the child is paramount in decisions. The decision is odd in that it is in an area where the European Court normally respects the diverse practices and discretion of individual nations within Europe. The European Court did not invent a right to procreate; nor did it insist that conjugal visits be granted, or that reproductive facilities be granted to all citizens; it focused instead on the quality of the balancing of considerations within the policy of our government in refusing AI to prisoners. Nevertheless, the decision, inconsistent though it is, and based on a procedural argument, may be interpreted by lawyers in future cases as having originated a right to reproduce within the list of human rights.      Contrast this with the Israeli action in the case of Yigal Amir, the assassin of Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, in 1995, a killing undertaken in order to derail the then peace process. Under Israeli law prisoners are allowed to marry and have children, but in his case, because of the nature of the crime, the right to marry had been refused. Nevertheless he married, by proxy, Larissa Trimbobler, a 42 year old divorced mother of four, who shared his political views. After more than two years of petitioning for the right to consummate their marriage, she was allowed a conjugal visit in late 2006; the courts had held that prisoners have these human rights. She gave birth to a boy in 2007. Israel is a very pro-natalist country, but these actions caused some public dismay, because they amounted to nationalistic defiance as well as human rights for prisoners.      The leading case in the US is Gerber v Hickman (2002), where after some vacillation court by courts, Gerber was finally denied the right to AI for his wife. He was serving a sentence in California of 100 years for murder and his wife was 41. The court held that there was no constitutional right to procreate while in prison. Conjugal visits too were denied to lifers because there was no expectation that they would ever be reunited with their families.      Two Spanish prisoners have reportedly received IVF treatment while in prison. Fernando Garcia Jodra, 40, and his girlfriend Nerea Bengoa Zarisolo, 39, were convicted of terrorist activities associated with the Basque separatist organisation ETA in 2004. They were being held in separate prisons and denied physical contact with each other. The couple applied for fertility treatment under Spanish law, which permits women wide access to reproductive technologies. Mr Jodra, one of the gunmen convicted for the murder of former Spanish government minister Professor Ernest Lluch, was transferred to a different prison to undergo fertility treatment. The couple are reportedly being treated at the Reina Sofia Hospital in Corboda, southern Spain. The president of the Victims of Terrorism Association, Mr Angeles Pedraza, expressed anger at the news saying the treatment was 'a kick in the face for the victims'. The Spanish press report that, if the treatment is successful, the couple's child will remain with Ms Zarisolo in custody until three years old. This is not the first time Spanish prisoners have applied for fertility treatment. In 2008, a Spanish woman, Ms Elena Beloki was reportedly granted permission to access IVF while serving a 13-year prison sentence for her involvement with ETA.      The Australian Supreme Court allowed a woman in prison for fraud to continue with self-funded fertility treatment. Ms Kimberley Castles had begun IVF treatment at a clinic in Melbourne prior to her imprisonment.      In the UK the Justice Secretary launched a campaign in 2013 to stop prisoners being allowed to AI/IVF. Mr Graylings pledge indicates that he is prepared to take on the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which has previously ruled that blocking access to such treatment may breach inmates right to a private and family life. The minister has said in the past that such cases starkly illustrate the need for a change to the human rights framework. Recently he told a newspaper that he has ordered a review into the policy on prisoners having access to artificial insemination with a view to banning it. In December, it emerged that five life prisoners - four murderers and a convicted drug dealer  had asked to be allowed NHS fertility treatment so that they could father a child from behind bars. However it is feared that his proposed ban on inmates receiving fertility treatment will end up back in the courts and could see inmates who are refused treatment winning compensation.      Time will tell.      All the above reflect my own personal understanding and appreciation of relevant law and ethics. I raise these points for the purposes of discussion which (by reading others views and responses) helps me determine my own perspectives.

748	160	1	"I agree. It's rather easy to talk about rights but, given that disputes are often settled in courts it's good for clinicians to appreciate how these things are dissected forensically. Although it's not surprising, it's still unsettling to be reminded that, like clinicians, different courts come to different judgements, some of which can seem perverse.   Dr S mentioned something in an early postthat intrigued me:   ""Sometimes there are medical or even evolutionary reasons behind infertility. Should the courts be granting rights that counter evolution?""   I couldn't immediatelythink of reasons that might 'counter evolution' but I wondered if this meantgenetic disorders that woulddiminish in the population ifnot transmitted and thatthis ran counter to the popular view ofevolution as 'survival of the fittest'. I think a more current concept of genetics might refer more to adaptability in the face of adverse environments but perhaps Dr S could explain. It's interesting that the legal approaches seem to be more pragmatic and not to defer to biological concepts or belief systems.-2q2a9hoiva8n2c2a3ay3b1by"	Maxim	9/8/2014 4:32 PM	0	0
749	160	1	A new concern has arisen in this debate. A Liverpool NHS Hospital has announced that it is opening Infertility treatment centres in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Amnesty International has expressed deep concern about the practical aspects of this service in countries that regard women as second class citizens. Male family members make decisions and want male babies.        Will women essentially have to follow the orders of a man and have no choice in any regard to treatment. Will they be vessels required to carry male children? According to Amnesty International research, women in Saudi Arabia regularly require the permission of a male guardian to seek medical care including fertility treatments. Adam Coogle, a Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: There is a complex web of rules that means women are treated as minors by male guardians for the entire life.        The hospital is opening these centres because the management envisage large profits which they will use within the trust.        Will the NHS be in collusion with discriminatory practices?        kirked                            .-wr3aqzfexcoeeeee213202gzdar9	kirked	8/9/2014 5:33 AM	0	0

First, is there a 'good eugenics'? I thought that despite its proponents from Francis Galton to ""The Bell Curve"" it had been shown to be a false science with severe potential for abuse.     But, what about those who have paid, or have had the NHS pay, for their children to be born by donor insemination?  If you had a child under these circumstances, and they were autistic, wouldn't you ask the Bank who was the donor? And if they were in this group, sue the Bank, for millions, for support if not 'mental anguish'?

752	161	1	Leaving aside other disputes about personal ethics and responsibilities of sperm (or eggdonation), I wonder if such sperm bank exclusions are really that different, in principle,from the choices and exclusions that have been made for centuries by men and women looking for mothers and fathers to their hoped-for children.   Personally I find many eugenics ideas distasteful but there are sections of society (no names no pack drill) here and abroad that routinely do background searches on the pedigree, health and other attributes of prospective partners. Experience shows that such searching, matching and exclusionoften doesn't guarantee 'success'but the right to make such choices doesn't seem to be much questioned even if we find it amusing.   I guess that the vast majority of people rely largely on pot luck for their choices and this might well be the best plan but the criteria for exclusion are obviously on a spectrum. At one end we have the problem of lethal and other desperate diseases whose inheritance and predictability are beyond much doubt.At the other end we have characteristics and behaviours that are much less certain in their inheritance and expression.   I'm prepared to bet that we would never have had many of thepeople who changed the world for the better if their parents had relied on family history before breeding.-5k9aydrt6b7a4zse5ev	Maxim	30/12/2015 3:41 PM	0	0
753	161	1	"Maxim - not sure how you chose your partner (or vice versa) , but it seems to me that some degree of ""eugenics"" , consciously or subconsciously comes into play. The decision to screen for major genetic diseases also seems appropriate in some rare instances for the sake of the offspring. ""Pot luck"" suggests not even considrering a whole range of factors contributing to compatibility. Perhaps one of the reasons for the UK's high divorce rate.   Consumer choice has all sorts of manifestations. Sperm banks need to be open about their selection process for donors - just how selective may vary with demand , supply and competition. What is the obligatin to the donor if the sperm is screened and significant disease potential found ? presumably some screening takes place already. Just how rules are developed in this new world is not always clear in this age of sperm and egg donation. Currently I doubt whether the rules used will make a significant difference to the overall human gene pool and perhaps we should just watch how this market develops?   John D raises the point about responsibility - failure to check could be the Bank's , failure to declare that of the donor .... I suspect there is a lot of counselling involved.-ld7"	sken	30/12/2015 5:17 PM	0	0
754	161	1	Thanks Sken   I hasten to add that, by 'pot luck', I was referring specificallyto the choice of a future co-parent for children. I agree that the way we choose a partner for romantic and other reasons is determined, sometimes quite quickly, by a range of conscious and subconscious influences. Personally, I doubt thatI thought initiallya great deal about the suitability of my wife as a child-bearer. Others wouldundoubtedly differ in their choice.   This seems to be a key difference in having a choice of sperm (or egg) donor where thecomplexities of personal compatibilityare irrelevant but genetic fitnessisthe only consideratioin the contextyou describe.-vlr8b9kzat8dn8jqb8acv	Maxim	31/12/2015 11:10 AM	0	0
755	161	1	"Maxim - yes I think there is a complete range in spouse selection from those who give it little thought to those where it really is a major factor. It could be women are far more selective in this repect eg will spouse be able to provide for children comes into it as well.   Where one stands in this behavioural spectrum also influences one's ethical views and sympathies on subjects such as IVF on the NHS and our attitudes to sperm donation. There is also the problem of whether a spouse is prepared to take second place to offspring - fine if the children are central to the marriage but can be a problem if not?   Personally I have no problem with those who look a little into family educational or sporting background before leaping into matrimony but as with everything else it seems abnormal when it becomes a bit obsessive. At the other end I am quite happy with the idea of marrying for somewhat romantic reasons but raise my eyebrows at the wedding as an additional excuse for a party after a lustful meeting on a beach somewhere...   At the very least perhaps it is a good idea for the couple to have a broad idea about how they see the children issue before settling down together.   My own view is somewhat ""gestalt"" : the spouse is rather more than just a series of parts and it is the whole person that can crucial.   I wonder if we will ever be able to find alternatives to words such as eugenics and euthanasia - the only that comes to mind is ""common sense"" and ""middle road"" .-kv3"	sken	31/12/2015 5:30 PM	0	0

757	163	1	"This morning (2/9/15) a joint statement fromthe Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Association of Medical Research Charities and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council all issued a joint statement, saying that genome editing should be allowed, ""when justified"". http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2015/WTP059712.htm   Their analysis of the success and accuracy of the CRISPR-Cas9 technique is that it offers the potential of curing conditions with a known genetic basis. They say that this technology should be investigated and developed, but that work is inhibited by current law prohibiting embryos that have altered genes form surviving beyond 14 days. They do not at present suggest that such embryos be allowed to survive longer or even to be implanted. Instead, they have issued this statement to stimulate discussion among scientists, politicians and the public about genome editing, so that for once opinion can lead legislation.   The possibilities for genome editing are both clear and exciting. It would be possible to gene-edit cells from a patient without the apparently dangerous use of carrier viruses, and return them to their body to counteract the results of the remaining faulty genes, and even to attack cancer cells.  This could help people with a single genetic fault, such as cystic fibrosis or haemophilia, but of more concern would be using this on embryos.   If that embryo were allowed to be born, then the child would not be 'cured', they would never have the condition that their parents carried, and need have no fear of their children being carriers of the disease.  This altering of the gene line is at the same time of concern to many, if it causes changes that appear later down the generations.   The research bodies think it is time to discuss how, what and when such a technique should be used, so that in the future, the near future, the law may be changed to allow its use in circumstances that are acceptable to the majority.   Do you think that embryo gene editing should be allowed?   John-hs9clljixg2da39bb8lbb6"	John D	2/9/2015 9:47 AM	0	0

There has to be a balance but we have edged towards a viewpoint that ""I will do what I want now - and someone else is responsible for putting things right and paying for them later on if things are not right"".   For the genetic engineering as envisaged here we need a very full analysis about the risks of the gene expressing itself later on and the NNT . We would then need hard data on just what are the implications and whether there are any other implications for manipulating this gene. A cost evaluation is relatively simple but must include potential economic benefits as well as the cost of treatment.   To avoid any slippery slope we also need a carefully crafted change in the law so that any extension requires formal amendment.   We also need to persuade some of the charities for those with disabilities that this approach does not in some way demean those with the relevant disease.

My own answer would be definitelyto keep them and this would apply even if, the person is later found to have done 'bad things'. Reiter is an example where the eponym has recently been expunged from usage. I would argue that we should always try to learn about the names enshrined in these eponyms and to be aware of and learn frombad things that were done. We can't, or shouldn't, trytorewrite history.   Anyone with any sense should realise that diseases, structures and processes first described decades or centuries agomay now have a very different profile which keeps changingand it's incumbent on all clinicians to keep up to date with current knowledge, at least in their own field.  There's a danger that we come to think Medicine is only about now and isjust aproduct of the most recent guideline, dictats or even financial statement. Thisisprobably notaccidental but our current clinical practice arises from an unbroken lineage of people, advances and lessonswith an unbroken line extending back and, we hope, forwards.  Appreciation of how we got here is rapidly being lost in medical education; many students and new doctors look blank when even names such as Osleris mentioned (while talking about 'coeliac's disease as if Dr Coeliac described it!). It's clearly not necessary for a formal history of Medicine to be taught routinely but our mostvalued teachers and mentors extend well beyond those who are still alive. The lessons from even those who are long deceased are often still valuable today.

769	167	1	F. Bruder Stapleton, MDreviewingAdelman J et al.Pediatrics2015 Jul 13.    Using a distinct temporary first name that incorporated the mother's first name reduced wrong-patient electronic orders by 36%.        Newborns must be given an immediate temporary first name, which most often is Babyboy or Babygirl. These nondistinct names can be a source of medical errors and misidentification.             In one center's NICU, interventionists created a distinct first name for newborns that incorporated the mother's first name. For example, in the case of a fictional mother named Wendy Jackson, a daughter would be temporarily named Wendysgirl Jackson rather than Babygirl Jackson. For multiple births, a number was added in front of the distinct name (e.g., 1Wendysgirl, 2Wendysgirl). To assess the effectiveness of this naming convention, researchers evaluated the incidence of wrong-patient errors during the 1-year period before and after the intervention. Errors were captured using an automated tool that probed the medical record for orders that were retracted and reordered (RAR).  RAR events declined by 36% during the first year after implementing the intervention (odds ratio, 0.64). Use of the distinct first name was particularly beneficial in reducing RAR events in orders placed by house staff (OR, 0.48) and in orders concerning male infants (0.39).-xx9ajqk384541ila84a5a9gn70goa85a5a5g	Mukhtar Ali	30/7/2015 9:01 PM	0	0

Of course the law may not always be enforced , but insurance might become invalid if a helmet is not worn.  The Telegraph and the Hilton could be seen to abetting a crime and obviously this is an inappropriate advert. At the very least it is misleading . Personal choice - yes , but in the context of reasonable understanding of what one is choosing and knowledge of whether or not one is breaking the law?

More than likely, some ad agency graphic designer grabbed a stock photo of people on a moped and used it to design a spread. It was probably someone who has never been within 20 feet of a scooter and has no idea what the laws actually are. It was then passed through a team of people who, likewise, had no idea what the image -should- look like, beyond ""compelling to the target consumer.""

779	171	1	I've noticed one colleague who tends to automatically copy the patient's accent in order to facilitate communication. When I had a discussion with the doctor he stated that he names it mirroring. He does it for two reasons. First, he imitates the accent to build rapport with the patient so as to have some familiarity. Second, he uses local terminology to make it easier for the patient to understand him.   I wonder whether you find this a necessary communication skill or a manifestation of pretention that may be perceived by the patient as derogatory sign or an expression of lack of authenticity	Sidhom	23/2/2015 7:31 PM	0	0
780	171	1	I don't think you need to parrot accents to communicate. You could sound silly. Why can't the patient copy your accent? Are we superior?   On the other hand I try to use analogies germane to the patient's background to explain stuff. I also use vocabulary including slang appropriate to that person's in order to convey ideas. However I don't indulge in obscenities or vulgarity.   Your job is to deliver ideas, advise and treat and words are the colours on your pallet. Your brush technique is your call.

787	171	1	I think from a British point of view it is regarded as offensive, however, from a British Indian point of view, imitating accents is key to improving communication.   Don't get me wrong, to observe it's awfully awkward, however what one needs to remember is that individuals who have learnt English in another country, or are visitors or new to the country, have learnt English with their home country's pronounciation.   As a person who lived in a European country for a number of years, it was much easier to communicate in english using that country's pronounciation of the alphabet.   Bringing back to the British Indian element, when communicating with family members coming over to visit, I cannot speak an Indian language, they speak English with a strong Indian accent. I can say a statememt or question 5 times in my standard english accent, with no effect, the second I repeat myself in a mirrored accent (note - not a humrous mocking accent, but simply mirroring their pronounciation), communication flows without problems.   Relating this to patient care, it saves time and allows for effective communication. If the person you're communicating to responds, then it's something that should be considered for normal practice. It is possible to be polite and inoffensive when mirroring accents.-ep8	PRGdoc	28/2/2015 12:28 PM	0	0

789	172	1	Despite the rapid advances in transplant mmedicine and in re-attaching the nerves of severed limbs, and even spinal cord tracts, most people think that to transplant a head is still in Science Fiction. But an Italian surgeon, Sergio Canavero, has proposed a project to achieve this by 2017.  He thinks that procedures to encourage restoration of spinal cord function are sufficient, and that tissue cooling and revival techniques will protect the brain.  He is far from being the leader of a wide group of transplant surgeons, but will be speaking at a major conference in Annapolis in June this year.   But who will be the subject of these operations?  Canvero suggests that brain dead donors should be used first, wholly as expertimental subjects, but who could be to object of a successful technique?  People with extensive metastatic cancer or debilitating neurological disease? People with severe body image problems, like those who want a limb amputated, with multiple traumatic limb loss, people with severe multi-joint arthritis or just old people?

As the latter is always allied with politics, and while we fear neither here, the discussion needs to as civilsed as it almost always is on D2D. Long may it do so!   My own view is that suicide is far most often associated with depression, which is or should be a temporary mental disturbance for which treatment is always availbale and usually successful.   I would not accuse our psychiatric colleagues of treatment failure, any more than a surgeon whose patient dies, but suicid as a symptom of deprssion si esenetially avoidable.   But then there are people so unfortunate as to have good reason for thinking that thier lives are not worth living.  The UK Gov has made it known that any person in this position who goes to Switzerland and Dignitas will not have their family or carers indicted for 'aiding and abetting"", but ciontinues to insist that it will not make any moves towards giving 'assisted suicide' similar status to that in several US States, were its use had increased since first allowed but still helps tiny numbers of people.

793	173	1	"Suicide is too complex to be seen as a single entity. I would not see those killing themselves whilst deeply depressed as actinng ""unethically"", but rational suicide is a more interesting problem - and one in which there is a growing interest. Is the patient who refuses life prolonging treatment in the absence of significant depression acting unethically or simply making a balanced judgement ? There seems to be growing interest in the concept of a ""completed life"" : is there a time when individuals might see their lives as completed and be ready for death - increasingly relevant to some older folk but not limited to them?    Our literature and culture also shows a respect for those who lay down life for the sake of others and one of the great religions has a suicide as a centrral theme.   I see each act of suicde as a separate event. I see somethinng unethical about it if done for frivolous or petulant reasons , tragic if part of a treatable depressive illness or readily correctable social factors , but see certain circumstances where it is an eminently rational decision. Survivors and those left behind need to be taken into account but because these may feel guilty or distressed is not necessarily a reason for the suicide not going ahead. Nor does it ,in itself, make the suicide unethical.   The original question also seems to cofuse legality and ethics : lots of things (abortion , homosexuality etc...) may be illegal at one time or place. That does not make them unethical.   An interesting additional question might be to ask whether doc2doc members would ever consider accompanying or supporting someone in going to Dignitas.....or assisting suicide should the law allow this.

805	175	1	"Totally tangential , but illustrating a Society aspect of the problem , there is comment in the news to-day on a study suggesting that songs such as ""When I am 64"" (Beatles) a negative effect on the self-esteem of older people which could lead to other health problems. The authors of the study are concerned that old age might be associated with physical decline and unattractiveness. This is of course not the case and the glories of old age are frequently expounded by many pressure groups and denial of old age as a period of decline per se also seems to be denied by some academic geriatricians.... Presumably Shkespeare's seven ages of man will be removed from ""As you like it"".    Along with many older folk , I see old age as a time of progressive decline to the point where the alternative seems increasingly attractive. It is part of who we are - at least those who make it to that stage of life.   How does this fit in with BIID and a wish to be ""disabled"" ? I am not sure it does but perhaps those who wish to grow old and sit back in a comfortable retirement , denying increasing frailty , and gently rot , glass in hand and not using what function remains to them , could be seen as one end of the spectrum. Concern with our body image and a lack of realism is an aspect of our Society - and humanity - along with failures to use what we have to the full. There are times when it becomes so extreme it needs to be seen as a disease.   James - an interesting topic , but what one would like to see is a history of how it emerges in the patient eg waking one morning and deciding ""my leg offends me"" or does the feeling come on gradually and does this onset affect outcome? Would earlier intervention help?   It would also be interesting to know if there is any particular religious background cf the New Testament ""Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee ,cut them off and cast them from thee"" . Is there any equivalent in the Koran ? Anyone ever circumcised themselves? Years ago I remember tales of fakirs who lived with one arm held in the air until it withered from disuse ? Are there any schizoid patients who have been told by ""God"" to have a limb removed?   One individual I came across with this disorder had an interesting variant . A heavily built man making slow progress down the sex-change route . Totally frustrated with the slow progress , he went into one of the lavatories next to A&E and castrated himself. Whateve rthe rights and wrongs of treatment , the depth of anguish which some of these folk feel can be very real. Our lack of understanding should not belittle this - perhaps we should not conflate them with those who just want to change their breasts or bottom in line with a social fashion...-ye6ed3td3ymwec33"	sken	8/3/2016 7:53 PM	0	0
806	175	1	The BIID seems to fall into a continuum of disorders that would range from the mild body dysmorphic disorder, which in the phenomenological descriptive psychopathologic jargon would be called an 'over-valued idea' up to a 'delusional belief'. BIID seems to contrast a commonly described phenomenon called 'Phantom Limb' as described in Fish's Psychopathology, and Andrew Sims 'Symptoms in the Mind'. Oliver Sacks in his book 'The man who mistook his wife for a hat' postulated that phantom limb could serve a function when prosthetic limb is attached thus he seems to have questioned the 'pathologization of the symptom'.   The issue with rejecting ones limb seems quite easy to pathologise, however, when it comes to aesthetics as the shape of the nose, lips, breasts or buttocks the borderland between dysmorphobia and cosmetic surgeries.

809	176	1	The BBC Health reported a case of aphantasia; describing a man who cannot visualise or form imagery.The only reference cited is from Cortex journal a letter to the editor named lives without imagery; congenital aphantasia. doi:10.1016/j.cortex.2015.05.019   I wonder how much syndromes can be built on single case reports, and I have my concerns about such labels, and whether these would have any significant clinical implication or not. I am not sure I have encoutnered any case of 'aphantasia' I am a bit curious about your practice whether you met with cases that would qualify to this disorder or not.	Sidhom	27/8/2015 7:16 AM	0	0
810	176	1	I think this is mainly semantics, plus some variability in human abilities, not pathology.   A visual artist must be able to see what they are trying to achieve, in paint, sculpture or film 'in their mind's eye' to a great degree, while the rest of us have that ability to varying levels of complexity.   Most doctors will have some knowledge of anatomy, and can 'see' the heart beating, the blood circulating. the diaphragm moving in respiration.  'Visualising' more complex movements is much more difficult to understand and visualise, for instance joints, all of which use a complicated combination of rotation and sliding, so that the development of replacements has been slow, aprt from the materials question.      Just closing the eyes sees nothing, blackness apart from the 'phosphenes' you see when you rub your eyes, and varying pressure fires rods and cones at random.

811	176	1	I am also a bit sceptical about this. The authors initially reported a patient who had problems with imagery after a coronary angiogram. They were then contacted by 20 individuals (all men for what it's worth) who claimed they'd had a similar problem lifelong. The authors investigated these people by questionnaire and found reduced capacity for imagining. The authorsacknowledge others' scepticism but think that aphantasiamay be as real as synaesthesia and that brain functionalimaging may help to elucidate what's happening. As an aside, it seems ironicto use external imaging to investigate internal imaging!   I have never seen anyone claiming this specific disability but surely ourcapacity to imagine any real or abstract things is on a spectrum and that this can be, at least partly, a learned and learnable skill. Might there be an analogy with those who display reduced or absent emotional intelligence? My understanding is that this is the ability to imagine what effect things we do or say may have on others. Some people with autismpresumably have this problem but my understanding is that emotional intelligence is something that can be modified (up or down) with training.   I'll defer to Sidhom and others if I've got this wrong.-gv6apeyf5dm0d0c6b3a6kyfzd6ey	Maxim	27/8/2015 12:51 PM	0	0
812	176	1	How can a person claim to be unable to form imagery, yet by the assertion that he cannot he has in his mind formed an image of the inability to form an image?? Surely this is as John said Semantics, you cannot be afraid of the lack of fear? Surely this borders on Whiteheads or Spinozas writings, somewhere in Epistemology or basic Philisophy lies the rubicon of logic regarding such a dilemma. Occams razor should cut this one to shreds.

813	176	1	With loss of one of senses it is relatively easy. With anosmia it is easier, one cannot know whether there is a smell or not, with deafness, blindness, loss of touch; it is easy to assess. However, with loss of the unknown to the person, how can this be assessed, does this person draw, how about visuospatial abilities, and navigation skills, how about writing, how did this person learn colours and can he recall them.   I wonder about daydreaming, night dreaming, sexual fantasies, and ability to anticipate based on imagination. Is there a centre for imagination in the brain that can be attributed to this, what else is affected then.   I cannot make sense of it.	Sidhom	27/8/2015 7:09 PM	0	0

816	176	1	"Is the reported inability to form mental images really any big deal? I tried to read a bit about the psychology of thisbut the confusing literature could make you lose the will to live.   Theunsolved argumentseems to be whether the subjective abilityto form images is the mechanism behind performing complex cognitive and motor tasks or whether these skills depend on some other underlying process that's independent of that pictorial imagery.   I find it difficult to believe that we can perform complex tasks (even hammering a nail into wood rather than our thumb) without the ability to imagine the various 'what ifs' even if theseare not pictures. Otherwise we might have to say that people who claim aphantasia should be barred from driving cars and other potentially dangerous activities.   I'm sure that people who can draw and paint have much better visual imagery than I do but that's perhaps because they see and remember more effectively in the first place.

819	177	1	The Greek tragedians explored the consequences of moral imperatives clashing with human inadequacies, and I feel that this is often what happens with shared decision making in medicine. Every day, distressed people come to see us, and within 10 minutes we are supposed to explore their distress and offer the means of relieving it. The easiest route is often to diagnose depression and either pass them over to someone else to deal with it or offer them a drug labelled as an antidepressant. Actually, I dont think this should ever happen: always first offer understanding, assurance that the distress will get better, the promise of support, and another appointment in the very near future. In the meantime, give them Robert Burtons advice fromThe Anatomy of Melancholy: be not solitary, be not idle. (see Chris Dowricks bookBeyond Depression). But at some point thereafter, you may decide to offer an antidepressant drug. The evidence base for theseand especially for comparisons between themis wretchedly inadequate, as you can discover in Peter Gtzsches new bookDeadly Psychiatry and Organised Denial. So how can you actually achieve an informed choice with the patient in front of you? I have to say that I think its impossible, given the inadequacy of the evidence. When I tried to create an Option Grid for this, I gave up after months of effort; and long ago, I tried about six of these drugs before I found one that worked. Its main effect was to make me feel worse when I came off it. However, the choice may have to be made, faut de mieux. Here isa trial of a Depression Medication Choice (DMC) encounter decision aid conducted by my friends and heroes at the Mayo Clinic. The DMC decision aid helped primary care clinicians and patients with moderate to severe depression select antidepressants together, improving the decision making process without extending the visit. On the other hand, DMC had no discernible effect on medication adherence or depression outcomes. By translating comparative effectiveness into patient centered care, use of DMC improved the quality of primary care for patients with depression.-5g0d5cym7rv941dcbt19ciba606fpgld5l4fq5utl5veiq4ainkvz	Richard Lehman	12/10/2015 3:41 PM	2	0

821	177	1	"In Pakistan and other East Asian countries, patients--and their relatives--attribute their symptoms to a physical cause. Patients remain unconvinced that their symptom such as giddiness or headache has no physical cause. CT scan or MRI is ordered without givingany help in making a diagnosis. When the physician fails to find a physical reason, patient either consults some other physician or approaches faith healers without getting any relief. If the patient is referred to a psychiatrist or the physician prescribes antidepresst or tranquilizer, patient feels offended and blames the physician for failing to find ""actual disease"".Such patients suffer for long time. Even relatives and attendents refuse to believe that the patient is suffering from a psychiatric disease. In such situation it is very difficult to achieve an informed choice.

822	177	1	"What is ""an informed choice"" ? Sometimes we assume this to refer to the patient's choice at other times it seems to be the doctor who has the dilemma in interpreting information and being ""informed"". Sometimes too the doctor feels if the patient chooses something other than the medical recommendation then the choice must be being made in an absence of being ""informed"".   There will always be patients who view these choices in different ways. If the patient sees the social stigma of depress as something which outweighs potential benefit , that does not mean the choice is less than informed. If the doctor uses a subterfuge and says that the antidepressant drug is to help pain (when this does not really apply) so the patient takes it then the patient is deprived of the opportunity of making a properly informed choice. The same applies in pain relief. Can one make an informed choice about refusal of therapy , if the effects of that therapy (for better or worse ) have not been tried ? Usually one has to do just that.   Of course the options change as one moves into more severe depression - should patients who is so depressed as to feel themselves unworthy of treatment be allowe to refuse - I have faced this dilemma when using ECT. With depression the nature of the beast can impair judgement - but not usually to a significant extent in minor variations and many patients seem able to make an informed choice based on likely benefit and probable side-effects.   Just what is informed choice is a highly complex subject and - as with going to war in Iraq - many folk change their mind retrospectively and opinion changes on whether they had been adequately ""informed"" beforehand. In how we present information to patient we influence how the patient sees this. The hardest bit to assess is often what the treatment or tests will mean to the individual patient - some patients will gain enormous reassurance , way beyond the value of the test , from ""negative"" test for cancer. Others do not need this. Informed choice involves looking at emotional factors as well as ""hard"" evidence. We can but but recognise factors outside our control.

823	177	1	I am a GP in Dublin and for the past 10 years I have a special interest in biochemical psychiatry. I went to Sydney in 2006 and it has really changed my practice. In most cases of anxiety/depression typically I prescribe citalopram 10 mg to be doubled in a week. I also do the following tests: plasma zinc, serum copper, caeruloplasmin, histamine, pyrrole and coeliac ab. Routine tests are done too. I find that I can replace more than half of patients on meds with nutrient therapy in a few months- zinc , B6, nicotinamide, magnesium,samE etc in individualised doses.   The word has spread and I see a few hundred cases per year, including a number of doctors.It is very satisfying to see so many recover but I cannot treat everybody.   Recently I got a phone call from a consultant psychiatrist in UK who is starting to learn about this work and who asked me questions for half an hour.   If anybody is interested I would advise startingby reading Nutrient Power by DrWilliam Walsh PhD. There is a website at www.walshinstitute,org and another at www.biobalance.org.au-they organise a course for doctors every year near Syndey.

825	178	1	Of course not all suicidal acts (successful or otherwise) are indicative of underlying mental illness anymore than every acute abdomen is surgical BUT , just as with the acute abdomen and surgery , one has to use the possibility of an underlying mental illness as a starting point. The matter is further complicated as there is some pressure and obligation to try to prevent the suicide whether or not there is mental illness present. And as with the acute abdomen the different underlying strands in diagnosis can take a fair amount of unravelling and even where there is no clear underlying mental illness there may be other factors (eg social) which might be changeable and alter the decision on self-harm.	sken	26/4/2016 11:05 PM	0	0

829	181	1	In his personal view forThe BMJ,Jim van Os writesthat the language used in current disease classifications implies schizophrenia is a distinct, genetic brain disease.   He says, Strangely, no such language is used for other categories of psychotic illness (schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, and so on). In fact, even though they constitute 70% of psychotic illness morbidity (only 30% of people with psychotic illness have symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia),these other categories tend be ignored in the academic literature (see box) and on websites of professional bodies. They are certainly not referred to as brain disorders or similar. Its as if they dont exist.   The best way to inform the public and provide patients with diagnoses, therefore, is to forget about devastating schizophrenia as the only category that matters and start doing justice to the broad and heterogeneous psychosis spectrum syndrome that really exists.   ICD-11 should remove the term schizophrenia.-x01air43a0f912396aqa11xjb56bidzh4a9p31aig	Sabreena	22/2/2016 2:03 PM	0	0

I watched with awful fascination as this sledge hammer convulsion, so powerful that anaesthesia was necessary to protect from fractures, was blithely applied. It seemed to be as scientific as proving that frogs hear with their legs (cut them off and when you make a noise - they don't jump!) If these modern therapies include inflicting convulsions, they are as unscientific and as revealing of our lack of understanding of the brain as ever.   John-g0nb3nn	John D	21/12/2015 10:05 AM	0	0
845	184	1	Contemporary ECT resembles old ECT probably in the name only. Its story resembles use of citrus for scurvy. Now, ECT has been heavily studied with RCTs, brain imaging and its mechanism of action, NNT, are more clear.   Other treatments do not generally involve convulsions except for magnetic seizure therapy. However, ECT remains the most effective of them all.	Sidhom	21/12/2015 5:52 PM	0	0

847	186	1	In contrast to the common folk wisdom that associates happiness with long life, reduced stress etc; a recent Lancet study, unhappiness does not increase mortality.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01087-9 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2901087-9/fulltext The study adjusted so many factors to reach this conclusion, which impresses me as, I never thought critically of this common wisdom, I wonder what are your opinions about this study.	Sidhom	11/12/2015 9:39 PM	0	0
848	186	1	At first glance I would suggest this study is pure Rubbish! Based largely on the fact it would appear to have been written by a pessimist! How can someone who is unhappy take pride or happiness in the fact people live longer when they are happy. There are many studies saying happiness does improve life span and quality...  https://news.illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/205399      I therefore conclude this study is written by a Happiness hater! It is no wonder that people who Hate women write articles denouncing womens rights, same applies to Race, color, creed, religion, etc. Unhappiness leads to depression, blood pressure and sugar problems, and a host of other illnesses. I can offer my own medical model, As a seasoned veteran Law Enforcement officer I was unhealthy the last few years of work. High blood pressure, gaining weight, high cholersterol, etc,. Now Retired from Police work I have perfect Cholesterol, perfect blood pressure, and weight is dropping faster than anything. I now feel healthy, and can pursue consultingfull time, with no pressures.   DuaneF-zc2aa3fa1ia4ke7da8f7b3fa8a9fsbza0ky	DuaneF	12/12/2015 2:42 PM	0	0
849	186	1	For me, the question is not whether the conclusion is right or wrong but why so much time, money and other resource was wasted on what seemssuch a pointless study.   I'd not actuallybeen aware that happy people were thoughtlikely to have a longer life expectancy than miserable people but, like all aphoristic wisdom, these ideas are only ever usefulif taken in contextrather than being applied in ageneralised way. Just looking back anecdotally, I'm aware that most of my friends and acquaintances who died young seemed quite happy people. Maybe another bit of folk wisdom 'the good die young' (cue a Marvin Gaye song) applied in their cases but I've also known despicable people who were insufferably happy.   It seems at best naive to think that self reporting of such a complex emotion as happiness could have any valid link to life expectancy. The authors acknowledge that we don't really know how to measure happiness and that seems to be the point: we shouldn't expect to take emotions and try to measure them like physical quantities such a blood pressure or serum cholesterol. Although we might be able to manipulate certain feelings chemically, eg by altering dopamine, we can't understand and describe emotionsadequately by scientific methods. Isn'tthis whyliterature and art are so vitally important.   We might improve the chances of a long life by having the right genetics and by avoiding harmful habits buttrying to achieve happiness is often self-defeating. If we'relucky enough to have it, a slightlyshorter,happy life might anyway be preferable to a longer miserable one.-wx5btb3b5ita4aq9jwnni2eqbi8m2bj9a	Maxim	13/12/2015 5:13 PM	0	0
850	187	1	John Nash winner of Noble prize in economics, died trageically in a car crash. The film made about his life, is generally considered one of the films that depicted mental illness in a general positive light, casting hope on good prognosis despite severeity of illness.   The scene that I find a bit casting a negative image is the Insulin Coma Therapy session. The pen ceremony is probably non-existent in the real world though quite touching to me. Raj Persaud in his blog on doctors.org.uk discussed the difference in psychiatric presentation between the real Nash and the film Nash.

852	188	1	"Do others feel ambivalences about these events? I am a very strong supporter of developing sporting options for those with a disability - perhaps particularly relevant for some of those injured in military service and one always hopes some of the technical advances will have a knock on effect for some of those less in the public eye.   My queries are in part about the complexity of the classifications and how these are implemented. I also feel that for some contests the more affluent countries have an unfair advantage where equipment is concerned.   In recent months there have been a couple of interesting developments. The first was the disqualification of a woman from the an canoeing on the grounds that her paralysis was fuctional rather than physical. the second was the decision that blind riders should wear a blindfold - some riders will be blind but have say 10% residal vision.Perhaps that should be enough , but who checks ? And just which disabilities should have their events - it will be interesting when a decision is finally made on whether gross obesity is accepted as a clear disability.   There are also a few sports where the disability concerned really seems very little impediment.   I am all in favour of somewhat specialist Games - for doctors , transplant patients and any other groups including those with degrees of disability or old age, but sometimes wonder whether we are losing a sense of perspective in our attempts to do the ""right thing""."	sken	4/12/2015 1:56 PM	0	0
853	188	1	"Sken,   Having served at the London Paralympics, I think I can tell you that despite the ""No Triumph - No Tragedy"" (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lypw4) attitude of the athletes, their achievements are inspiring, and if I may say so, that is what matters.  They have achieved much, and want more - why not?   Yes, there has been cheating in the Paralympics, notably the Spanish basketball team at the Sydney Games in 2000, who turned out not to have any mental handicap at all.  But all the forms of cheating that ablebodied sport is heir to have apperaed in Paralympic sport too,   I fear we should not be surprised - there are scoundrels and angels in the handicapped world too!   I was at the paralympic tennis, won (again) by the Dutch team, led by the extraordinary (and extraordinarily nice) Esther Vergeer, who has been world women's wheelchair champion for 13 years and won three gold Olympic medals.  Her wheelchair looked clunky and massive, an impossible ride for the twists and turns of wheelchair tennis - except it was made of TITANIUM, the lightest, strongest of metals. Yes, it must have given her an advantage, but hasn't she earned it?   The system intended to match athletes with similar disabilities is inevitably flawed, given the many ways taht the human body can fail.   Like the athletes, this is not a reason to give up on disabled sport.   John-sf0byjb6hb14ab0p5h"	John D	4/12/2015 3:36 PM	0	0
854	188	1	"John - don't misread me. I would never want to give up on sport for those with disabilities , but wonder whether we are doing enough at grass routes level by concentrating on making it an event for spectators seeing it as entertainment (+/- a betting opportunity these days). As is happening in sport elsewhere. It is not the level to which we are inspired but what the Games do for the rank and file for disability that counts.   Personally I do not like the idea of ""buying"" victory in part whether pharmaceutically or in equipment (some compromise is inevitable). One of the reasons why I like running and Laser (a one design class) sailing competitions. If these events are to be used for equipment development then that needs open recognition , but perhaps we should have events for those that have lost limbs through land mines to remind ourselves of the realities of existence for those with a disabilty in many parts of the world?"	sken	4/12/2015 7:18 PM	0	0

857	189	1	The correct answer is:H1 receptor blocking  Explanation:  Blocking of histamine 1 receptors by mirtazapine causes reduction in night time insomnia and may also lead to daytime drowsiness.   Mirtazapine blocks 5HT2C, 5HT2A, and 5HT3 receptors leading to increase in serotonin levels. This increase in serotonin acts on the 5HT1A receptors leading to improved cognition and antianxiety and antidepressant activity.

858	190	1	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)has come a long way and is still moving forward with new developments being announced almost every day. Before, there was a clear line betweenCTand MRI, but that black and white concept is fading away. With the introduction of powerful modules and software, there might come a time in the future where it wont matter which diagnostic method is performed, granted of course if there are specific indications or contraindications. With newer generationCT scannersto lower dosage while increasing quality, but MRI has no serious side effects related to increase in field strength. This is why researchers and clinicians are waiting with open arms for7T MRIand beyond.  MRItakes advantage of the fact that water is located in all tissues and organs, creating a signal which is then formed into an image. However, many people are unaware that MRI can be used to study other elements, like sodium, phosphorus and others. Sodium is a very important element in the human body. The only isotope that is stable is 23Na, which is the most abundant form. In the human body it regulates blood flow, blood pressure, osmotic pressure and pH. Sodium chloride, more commonly known as table salt, is our main source of sodium. You may have heard or read that salt is bad for your health, but abnormally low levels of sodium can also adversely affect health. The American Heart Association recommends ingesting less than 1,500 mg per day, which is considerably less than their previous number 2,300 mg per day. They explain that because hypertension risk is so high among Americans, 1,500 is the number that exemplifies perfect cardiovascular health. Obviously this number is not for everybody, because competitive athletes, people who work in conditions with elevated temperatures, i.e. those who sweat a lot, will require more sodium intake.

There is sodium everywhere in the body as there is water with its hydrogen?   Ah! Answered my own question!  23(usually written as a superscript)Na is the only stable isotope and is the one that alnost all sodium exists as!  24Na and 22Na have half lives measured in hours and years and exist as traces in nature and our bodies, the rest have half lives in seconds to milliseconds.  23Na is an isotope, but the one we would consider as 'normal' sodium.

860	190	1	"Again , many thanks but the thoughts of usefulness are optimistic. There seems little possibility that populations are prepared to modify their intake of excess food or sodium although individuals may do so.   Interesting experience on the train yesterday : 2 seats on either side of the of the carriage as ""priority seats"" for the frail etc... Each pair of seats was taken by a truly enormously obese woman. One of them tried to take as little room as possible but still left nothing except for a cachexic person. The other truly flowed into the entire double space. This is where we are heading in the UK at least and as with so much else these are the folk who will dictate design of transport etc... in the future. So just be sure your new generation of scanners are big enough. The Caribbean island I visited recently had just bought a scanner for its population of 35,000 - but residents are often so overweight that they have to be exported to another island for an MRI.-dzzd2"	sken	27/5/2016 9:10 AM	0	0
861	191	1	"For the past 40 years we have had escalating concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and increasingly we are now heading towards over restriction on prescribing. We will never get it completely right and clearly doctors need some official backing for their trying to refuse (and often upset ) many patients who demand them for the wrong reasons. The recent emphasis on patient responsibility is belated but very welcome.   But there will be a knock on effect. There will be those - including children - where antibiotics will not be given when that should have done. We may have to live with that but the judiciary is unlikely to see it hat way if a case comes to court. The suggestion of an instant test to detect whether there is a bacterial infection is unlikely to have universal application and has yet to be developed.. There are also some messy areas - is a higher dose more likely to breed resistant bugs ? Is the use of a combination better or worse? Should we really be waging war on common relatively commensal bugs such as Helicobacter pylori , whenever it is found , with a wide range of potent antibiotics - or other common problems such as Campylobacter jejuni and Clostridium when not causing significant disease? There are many borderline conditions where individual patients may feel a beneficial response but one might ""get by"" without prescribing (think UTI in women). And just what are we meant to do about gonorrhoea with its the rising incidence and drug resistance ?   Interestingly I gather the veterinary and farming use is far more relevant in the development of resistance to our more specialised antibiotics. But can one envisage vets refusing to treat someone's dog - a child perhaps - but certainly not a pet dog.....   The first step needs to be education of the public - as much as doctors - after all they are the folk with the biggest personal stake in good care. At last there really does seem to be a campaign for this. The second step is to ensure the pharmaceutical industry receives adequate support to seek out new antibiotics rather than just going for more profitable compounds for shareholder profits. And of course a few additional vaccines against some common infections would not go amiss.-i32dnp8"	sken	19/5/2016 8:27 PM	0	0

I have learn most material, I can not find exactly what the C14 biological half life is. Some material said is 12 days, but some say 40 days, according to the following links:     http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=13148b04-9295-41bb-bd8b-76dbd4ce7c00      here say: ""Following ingestion of the capsule by a patient with H. pylori, 14CO2 excretion in the breath peaks between 10 and 15 minutes and declines thereafter with a biological half-life of about 15 minutes. 14C-urea that is not hydrolyzed by H. pylori is excreted in the urine with a half-life of approximately 12 hours. About 10% of the 14C remains in the body at 72 hours and is gradually excreted with a biological half-life of 40 days.""      I know the amount of C14 I take is nothing at all, but I wonder, if I want to keep it safe to be pregnant, how long should I wait to be pregnant? will it hurt my ovum?

It is notoriously difficult to reproduce an X-ray on the printed page, and when Endgames has used several in the las tfew weeks, I can say that the problem has not been overcome. That of the 5th April includes arrows pointing at an area of blackness in an area of blackness and labels it ""properitoneal fat"". Yeah, fascinating.   The other labels are also unimpressive. The joy of Endgames is that of a diagnostic quiz, noteducation in recognition on a normal X-ray. If the reader cannot ID a vertebral pedical or the sacroiliac joint, then they needto revise basic radiology. To recognise the psoas muscle ona plain abdo X-ray may be a triumph, but it would be more useful if it was asscoiated with, say a psoas abcess.   In contrast, the same Endgame also showed a chest X-ray with obvious pathology, with a fascinating history and a valuable explanation of what should be done to elucidate the diagnosis anddetermine treatment.

911	201	1	Sidhom - it is unclear from your post whether it is addressing your worries or those of your patients. I think it is helpful to think along the lines of the answer from Odysseus. CXR equivalents can be very useful - it can sometimes be helpful in discussion with very aggressive parents pushing for inappropriate CT scans on a child. In general I have the impression that it is the doctor who is a bit casual about irradiation - but that is in the reassessment of patients not in the A&E setting . Most x-rays requests there are usually very low dose but that does not mean one should not have good indications for the request .-huqy	sken	1/4/2014 12:58 PM	0	0

Why is everyone so worried about Xrays when there are gamma rays everywhere, even coming out of the bricks on the wall as well as radon daughters in the air (radon has no sons as its XY's die in infancy).   No one mentions alpha particles as they are under the radar screen and the press hasn't heard of them and probably thinks they are the dominant dust mites in your vacuum cleaner.   And how about those lowly beta particles or the odd neutron with ADHD going too fast or the black hole sucking the juice out of some galactic grub a few parsecs down the road.

If there is a very thick inflammatory pleura, this change could be less marked as the wall is stiff.   In reality, we just use CT now and even FDG-CTPET which will show a ""hot"" pleura and surrounding structures and probable reactive mediastinal adenopathy.   The last such case was a man with a nocardia empyema. He also has asbestos pleural thickening and plaques. PET can be very useful in these complex cases.

931	203	1	Hi Sken,   I was waiting for that particular bone to be picked, so thank you! The article itself does not give any measurements of dose, and so 'low-dose' CT is presumed to be a recognised entity as separate to 'normal dose' clinical CT.    But the first reference from the paper (avaiable from the NEJMhere) does mention that the imaging parameters for 'low-dose' CT were set to give an effective dose of 1.5 mSv per scan, down from the 'normal dose' estimated at 8 mSV. The big question is whether the cancer induction risks are also reduced by 1/5, which is not really possible to determine if they are considered to be stochastic...   Weighing in at 0.015 mSv, a PA chest radiograph still packs x100 less of a dose punch than 'low-dose' CT.   What would you rather have?-2kuyircz	hip radiologist	5/9/2013 3:33 PM	0	0
932	203	1	Many thanks - I had been surprised that it had not been mentioned in the article.

936	203	1	When I see a nodule now eg 7mm I do a FDG-PET and I also use CT-PET a lot particularly in sarcoidosis and lung cancer.   If a nodule is FDG negative the probability of it being malignant is low.   The trouble is with the paper you cited is that at least where I work, there is now another advance eg FDG-PET which changes the whole ball game.   A hot lesion of course could be lots of things eg TB, infection, sarcoidosis, and even some carcinoids. However a cold lesion makes me breathe a little easier.   We have picked up FDG hot nodules only a few mm in diameter and which have been due to lung cancer.   Sorry to go a bit off topic but this is where the real word is now, at least where I work.

939	204	1	A research team from Johns Hopkins University has discovered evidence that abnormal function of the left atrium may lead to an increase in stroke risk. As the study showed, the risk for stroke was not dependent on the presence of atrial fibrillation. The findings go against the universally accepted notion that irregular rhythm in the upper chambers of the heart during atrial fibrillation (AF) causes blood clots to form, eventually finding their way to the brain.  The study was motivated by the knowledge that the current reasoning for stroke doesnt fit in with what clinicians see on a daily basis  not all individuals with atrial fibrillation have strokes and not all stroke victims have atrial fibrillation. So this means that people with abnormal function of the left atrium are at risk for stroke, not only those with AF.   Lead author and cardiologist Dr. Hiroshi Ashikaga, PhD, and his team f used a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom Avanta, Siemens Healthcare) with motiontracking software called multimodality tissuetracking (MTT) made by Toshiba to study the movement of the myocardium (cardiac muscle).

I fear that thisisa personal opinion of the Prof's, as the abstract contains no evidence to that effect.   The study involved 41 patients referred to the hospital over five years. The investigators used clinical tests as the 'gold standard' and compared those with Positron Emission Tomography (PET)using a glucose analogue to highlight metabolic activity, and Functional Magnetic Resonace Imaging (fMRI).They also assessed outcome after a year.    They found that, ""PET had high sensitivity for identification of patients in a minimally conscious stateand high congruence with behavioural CRSR scores."" fMRI was less sensitive. They also found that, ""13 of 42 (32%) of the behaviourally unresponsive patients (ie, diagnosed as unresponsive with CRSR) showed brain activity compatible with (minimal) consciousness (ie, activity associated with consciousness, but diminished compared with fully conscious individuals) on at least one neuroimaging test; 69% of these (9 of 13) patients subsequently recovered consciousness"" but offered no comparision with clinical testing.Moreover, the conclusionfound that, ""Cerebral 18F-FDG PET could be used to complement bedside examinations and predict long-term recovery of patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome.""

This is similar to the work from Cambridge and must be pretty horrific for many of the public . It raises many ethical issues about pain (or potential pain management) , feeding etc... For many people this is close to the ultimate awfulness of modern medicine - I remember a meeting a few years ago when only a handful of people in a large audience would have wanted to continue in this twilight state , but it will be difficult for doctors not to continue ""care"".

I also don't think higher doses have proven more beneficial in stroke prevention, while the side effects of cerebrel haemorrhage and GI haemorrrhage are real risks.	yoram chaiter	27/9/2011 6:31 PM	0	0

966	210	1	I was doing my ward round in our acute stroke ward few days ago, when I noticed that on this week we had two patients with significant postural drop in their blood pressure without being on antihypertensive. The sensory autonomic dysfunction is partly contributing but what is about the management. The physiotherapist rightly very concerned as the patients were limited in what they can do in this case.Starting the patient with postural hypotension on fludrocortisone is an important issue in view of the nature of the original cerebral ischaemic event.

975	211	1	Aspirin resistance  denotes those situations when it is unable to protect individuals from  thrombotic complications, or when it fails to produce an anticipated  effect in laboratory tests of platelet function. There are various  laboratory techniques with which to evaluate the effectiveness of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs. It has been estimated that in 5-60% of patients, aspirin  does not achieve adequate efficacy in various measures of platelet  activity. Some studies have revealed that vascular patients shown by  laboratory tests to be aspirin-resistant are at an increased risk of major vascular events. The suggested mechanisms of aspirin resistance, among others, include genetic polymorphisms, alternate pathways of platelet activation, aspirin-insensitive thromboxane biosynthesis, drug interactions, or low aspirin dose. An increase in the dosage of aspirin or conversion to clopidogrel or clopidogrel plus aspirin might be beneficial in the management of those patients who are aspirin resistant	haider77	13/7/2013 7:48 PM	0	0

991	216	1	I had a very successful TPA patient a few months ago.   She presented to the local ER within 15 minutes of a severe stroke, 24 NIHSS. Perfect TPA candidate.   So, this led to that; she was treated there and sent to me.   On arrival, she was closing the door on 3 hours. She had an NIHSS of 1. (Family said 0, she always talked that way.)   Her TPA? Saline flushes.   If she had gotten TPA, we would have praised the TPA.   Clearly an availablility bias.   On the other hand, I've seen innumerable patients bleed from TPA; I have yet to see one bleed from saline flushes.

He walks with the help of a Walker. He reports suffering from a Pain in the Hamstring and in the lumbar region of the back. The pain had it's onset 5 months ago. He doesn't have fever or had before the begin of the disease. No dermatologic findings or history.      Pain:   reports pain when sitting down but less when laying down. It is symmetrical and bilateral. When pressing the Hamstrings he reports ""very strong pain"" (on a scale of 0 to 20 it's a 15) and when moving the distal part of the leg it's a 10 (strong pain). There is a wakness throughout the leg. NO pain above the lumbar region.   Pain seems to be muscular.   Tests:   - on a previous hospital he had a back MRI. Results: Light protrusion in L4-L5 and L5-S1.   -Ordered: CPK, CBC and EMG      Overall: On my assesment I find that the pain in the back is due to the protrusions but is not significant when determining the source of the Myalgia.   DDX: - Attending proposed Juvenile Dermatomyositis but I disagree due to the lack of dermatologic findings   - Myositis   - Becker's muscle dystrophy: The time of onset (14 years) and the pain in the proximal lower limbs. There is history missing to confirm it. Against: No pain in the Proximal Upper Limbs.   -Muscle dystrophys.        Well, as you might have noticed I am a first year medical Student so I know I don't present the case with the adequate words. The history missing to further think about Beckers is due to the fact that I came with the idea after rearech after the consult.

1019	225	1	Awoke this morning to hear that GPs are going to have a six month trial of being paid 55 pound for every new case of dementia that they diagnose. This seems to me to be wrong on many levels. If dementia were a disease that could be cured then I would have no problem in making more diagnoses of dementia and 'curing' them. There is now medication for dementia. One of the problems is that to me the medication usually does not often work and never cures.   There are many down sides to the patient and not many up sides to a person diagnosed with dementia.   Imagine you are old, living reasonably in a nursing home and your GP diagnoses you with dementia. You will probably have to move to a dementia home , where all the patients have dementia.   Fuming into my coffee prior to this morning's Surgery.   I assume that it is just another Government silly idea. I doubt that the Civil Servant or Political Aidewho thought up the idea will be sacked, but in my opinion he or she should be.I hope it is not a politically motivated idea to discredit GPs and thus the NHS and make all who can afford to go private, go private and watch the NHS crumble.

1029	226	1	Actually stress causes lots of serious problem.

Michael Berry	15/9/2014 1:21 PM	0	0
1030	226	1	I think it is important for neurologists to help the MS patient identify the cause of the stress. This could be stress caused by the patients work, relationships and home life or life events.   The neurologist needs to put on their detective hat and ask a few questions if the MS patient mentions stress. The patient may not even be diagnosed with MS (it may only be suspected) at this stage so I think it is vital neurologists are prepared for this. Also to find out how long the patient has been stressed for and to find out the severity of the stress level, such as out of 1-10. Just by asking the patient out of 1-10 how stressed are you? 10 being the most stressed.   Then to warn the patient they need to get out of that stressful situation/ environment. A bit more difficult to do if it is life events but stress management can help.   Not all MS patients and CIS patients may be aware of the link of MS and stress and that stress may trigger a relapse.-ogzse5ma42	Loess	15/9/2014 1:30 PM	0	0
1031	226	1	"If stress is a trigger for MS, then tecniques that are directed are reducing stress should show a benefit. This recent meta-analysis found only a ""possible benefit to the use of meditation"" , which is the same as saying there is no evidence that it does. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105026   Even the Alternative Medicine school is as negative, as shown by this paperabout the effect of massage therapy on MS: ""The results displayed no significant changes in 6MWT distances or HAQUAMS scores. However, the participants perceived improvement in overall health as expressed in written comments."" In other words there was a placebo, but no real improvement. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24949078   Which should be no surprise in a disease that is subject to remission and relapse as much as MS.

1032	226	1	There are many cases of stress triggering MS relapses. It would not be a case of neurologists giving up science. There is the paper  Epub: Mohr et al. A randomized trial of stress management for the prevention of new brain lesions in MS. Neurology. 2012 Jul.  RESULTS: SMT-MS resulted in a reduction in cumulative Gd+ lesions (p = 0.04) and greater numbers of participants remained free of Gd+ lesions during the treatment (76.8% vs 54.7%, p = 0.02), compared to participants receiving the control treatment. SMT-MS also resulted in significantly reduced numbers of cumulative new T2 lesions (p = 0.005) and a greater number of participants remaining free of new T2 lesions (69.5% vs 42.7%, p = 0.006). These effects were no longer detectable during the 24-week post-treatment follow-up period.

1033	226	1	"Loess,   That report has two comments attached to it. One is an interpetation for lay readers of the article. The other is a review, whose full text I cannot access, but which is abstracted as,  ""Psychological stress has been suspected to play a role in multiple sclerosis (MS) since Jean-Martin Charcot first described the disease. Moreover, patients with MS intuitively make a connection between times of high psychological stress and exacerbations of their illness. In contrast to this anecdotal evidence, a systematic review by a task force assembled by the American Academy of Neurology in 1999 concluded that ""at present, the prospective data are insufficient to establish any such relationship [between psychological stress and MS] with reasonable medical certainty.""   Which truncation makes me wonder if the authors were setting out to either back up, or put down the previous review. Any have access to Neurology?   Does that journal regularly include such lay reviews of the papers it publishes?MS is such an awful, disabling disease that there are many anxious patients out there , straining for hope.

It was their first exacerbation and had left eye VI nerve palsy diplopia and was also suffering from what they describe 'raw extreme servere anxiety'. Patient did have loss of conciousness but this may have been due to lack of sleep and anxiety. Unfortunately the anxiety got out of control for various reasons including many disturbed nights sleep and hyperacusis causing night time anxiety attacks.   Treatment - possibly IV steroids and something to reduce the servere anxiety. Any suggestions as this would have involved mixing medications. thanks.-7vq5i5n9	Loess	9/6/2014 12:36 PM	0	0
1043	228	1	"Hi Loess.   It is difficult to comment on the case specifically, as there is little detail about the actual symptoms the patient had, detailed investigations and CNS imaging findings,their psychiatric history, pre-morbid functioning,and cognitive function, but I'd like to make somegeneralcomments which I hope will be of use.   Firstly, loss of consciousness is never a feature of anxiety or lack of sleep. I would be looking for an alternative organic explanation as you would with any other patient, including CNS reasons and the usual cardiovascular and respiratory pathologies.   Psychiatric symptoms are common with MS, both during exacerbations and in between episodes. While euphoria and an incongruentsense of well-being are the classical features, depression, sometimeswith anxiety, is at least as common. Of course, steroids are also beset with psychiatric side-effects and, whileessential medications, may also be exacerbating the patients anxiety. Cognitive impairment is also a common feature of an exacerbation of MS. These features may be due to the CNS inflammatory processes themselves, psychological factors around adjusting to illness, and/or side effects of treatments.   I'm not sure what you mean by ""the anxiety got out of control"", butit would beprudent to exclude other psychiatric symptoms, such as psychosis, which is rare but possible with MS, and mania, given the difficulties with sleep. Of course,the treatment of such a constellation of symptoms would be different than what you would offerforanxiety alone.   I also don't really want tocomment on specific medications for your patient, as all cases are different, but if the psychiatric picture consists of anxiety symptoms alone, non-pharmacological treatments should always be attempted first. Simple behavioural measures such as attempting to compensate for cognitive deficits, a detailed behavioural journal and some simple strategies (depending on what comes out of the journal) would all be helpful. I would evengo as far as to suggesta more formalcognitive behavioural therapy if the patient is willing and able to participate in this. As for medications, I would probably offer some lowdose atypical antipsychotic (ensuring a normal ECG, BP, and no potential contraindications or medicationinteractions), or low dose benzodiazepineonly if absolutelyrequired.The side effects of psychotropics can often muddy the waters with CNS diseases, and I would be cautious in using them. Of course, one would expect the symptoms to improve as the MS improves, so the patient woud needfrequent review and the treatment modified accordingly.   Finally, one should always take into account risk of self-harm, so this should always be asked about and managed appropriately.   Managing patients such as this certainly makes thecasefor the involvement of a liaison psychiatrist in your clinic, or at least access to one inyour hospital!-wh0fwb9bh4b73ajc1fyj8c6cl2nwddo4a64bxan4l9dvbsj9s4ie4"	ljc123	10/6/2014 1:18 AM	0	0

1045	228	1	Patient was suffering from stress already and had severe complications with the VI nerve palsy.  The VIth and VIIth (facial nerve) have their nuclei (nerve cell bodies) close together in the brain stem; hence a large MS lesion in the brain stem can cause both a 6th and 7th nerve palsy amongst other things and hence can be associated with hyperacusis.    Due to the brain stem lesion causing the VI nerve palsy patient was suffering from hyperacusis at night. They were also was suffering at night from severe phonophobia (anxiety of anticipating a sound or fear of a sound), this is often associated with hyperacusis. Phonophobia is an anxiety disorder. They were also suffering from severe hypervigilence and were an insomniac at night waiting in anticipation.

1056	230	1	I am interested in finding out the procedure at different hospitals for a VI nerve palsy caused by MS.   Patient in this case was initally examined by neurology, then an urgent (within two weeks) MRI scan was offered, and was advised possible swelling on the brain. MRI was done four days after this. Patient was then telephoned by neurology registrar with MRI results two days after this (due to weekend) then instructed to get oral steroid prescription from GP surgery. During this phone call they were informed 'swelling on the brain as suspected' by neurology registrar.   Patient had UTI dipstick check at GP surgery and was given diagnosis of 'inflammatory looking lesions which may or may not be MS' by GP on same day.   Do other hospitals follow same/similar procedure for an MS VI nerve palsy? I understand some neurologists are keen to make sure UTI check is thorough and at the hospital rather than GP surgery (Due to potential complications with oral steroids).-82z1	Loess	22/8/2014 7:43 PM	0	0

1059	232	1	I am an old age psychiatrist. I am surprised to hear that that there is loss of interest in dementia. There are emerging new medications in dementia (etanrecept, dimebon) and new doses of established ones as well (Donepzil 23.5 mg). The DSM 5 used the term neurocognitive disorder instead of dementia and demential with lewy bodies became an official diagnosis.   What I think may pose some difficulty is that dementia and a few other disorders, do not belong strictly to neurology or psychiatry. They form their own domain that can be called neuropsychiatry, behavioural neurology or organic psychiatry. If compared to psychiatric disorders, most if not all dementia have clear underlying neuropathology, that can be verified by imaging, MRI, DaTScan etc. As compared to neurology, most of the presentation is primarily behavioural.-1j	Sidhom	7/11/2013 11:46 AM	0	0

1062	232	1	Probably the last thing that an old age psychiatrist would want to prescribe is an antipsychotic. If you mean behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), then, they are best dealt with non-pharmacological interventions, the doctor may want to also to allow time for Choline Esterase Inhibitors (ChE-I) to help with this. Antipsychotics are quite awkward to handle with dementia. Some antipsychotics (AP) esp. SGAs raise the risk of stroke, some are known for metabolic syndrome and QTc interval prolongation. Some APs have an anticholinergic effect and may worsen cognitive functions, some do not have marked anticholinergic effect, but have extra-pyramidal side effects (EPSE), which may require the use of an antimuscarinic which may worsen cognitive functions. Patients with Parkinson's dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies are particularly sensitive to high potency antipsychotics.	Sidhom	12/12/2013 7:11 PM	0	0

1065	233	1	Hi all, I badly need some help.   I'm a GP myself, and am unsure where to go from here. I've had pain in the metatarsal heads region bilaterally for about 7 months now. It started off in my left foot when I was running a lot, gradually progressed to the point where I could hardly walk. The pain was sharp, in the ball of my foot and occured on lifting off the ground. I was tender over the distal metatarsal shafts. I saw an orthopaedic surgeon and a physio at the time, the consensus was I either had a metatarsal stress fracture or was about to have one, and we elected not to get any imaging as the treatment was the same regardless - just rest it. I wore a cam boot for a month, during which time I started to get the exact same symptoms in the right foot - just from walking around at work.   The physio made me orthotics with metatarsal domes which worked up to a point - they relieved the pain initially, but when I started trying to walk a bit more (and I don't mean much - like parking at the far end of the car park rather than at the front door of the supermarket) it all flared up again.   So I saw another physio, on the recommendation of a friend. His assessment was that my plantar fascia was extremely tight, and set about releasing it. I ditched the metatarsal domes at this stage. I rolled my foot on a golf ball every night with great relief. Over about 2 months things greatly improved to the point where I could walk around normally.   Things went pear-shaped when I tried running again - gentle runs, on flat grass, no more than two or three laps of a football field. Each time I've tried it's caused a flare and I've had to cease all activity.   My last attempt at running was 2 weeks ago, and since then the soft tissues over the plantar fascia have been really swollen and tender, which has never happend before in all of this. The golf ball, which before had nightly relieved my pain, now made things worse. I went back to the physio who did his usual manual stretching and massage, and instead of improving things it's made the inflammation worse. I have a dull burning sensation in my plantar fascia at night, and pain and a crackling sensation in the ball of my foot whenever I lift off the ground.   I'm at the end of my tether. I'm in my 30s and can barely walk. To me the whole thing seems like a mechanical problem, but I'm uncertain as to the exact diagnosis - everything I've read suggests plantar fasciitis causes heel, not metatarsal head, pain; and reliable information on metatarsalgia is hard to find.   I haven't gotten expert help sooner as I know I don't need an operation, and am reluctant to have a steroid injection, so what's an orthopod going to do for me? But I've realised I'm my own worst enemy and have booked an appointment. But any advice as to what might be going on or what I can do in the next month while I'm waiting to see them would be greatly appreciated.-w40f9	Gracie1986	21/5/2016 1:28 AM	0	0
1066	233	1	Gracie,   I'm an anaesthetist - what do I know about sports injuries?   Nothing, except that from my contact with sports doctors as an Olympic volunteer, I know that athletes don't get expert care from 'ordinary' clinicians and paramedical specialists.  Try to get referred to a sport specialist - your physio is more liklely to know one than most orthopaedic surgeons (Who, and whose specialty I respect).  Do you have a professional football/rugby team locally?  If you run, do you belong to a club? They may help to find you one.

1067	233	1	"Golly - you really have tried. I can only re-inforce the comment by John D. In the old days one would have recommended an old style rheumatologist but these seem a different breed these days and I think see things savouring of old-style physical medicine as beneath their more esoteric skills. You clearly have an ongoing problem but in the short term you need to find some other sporting activity which you can do. Running may be a bad activity for you - when I had to stop eventually I turned to cycling . That may just be feasible - with cleated pedals and good cycling shoes it is possible to keep the foot fairly rigid and not put too much pressure on the sole (using the upstroke more - great for the abdominals...) . The cleats can be moved to try to find a ""sweet spot"". There are other sports as well - I even resorted to swimming for a short period of recovery at one time , but not something I would do from choice.   I suspect that thee must be a number of physios around who have a particular interest in running injuries and problems from ""overuse"" but my impression is that some of what is practised and argued is a trifle fanciful. The other problem is time scale - orthopaedic folk often think in terms of months or years whilst the sportsperson thinks in days or just possibly weeks. Perhaps when one gives an active person advice to rest it should be accompanied by CBT for depression ?-7q1"	sken	21/5/2016 11:47 AM	0	0

1069	234	1	News of the sudden death of 30 year old Claire Squires at the end of the London Marathon on Sunday has led to widespread shock,sympthay and donations to the Samaritans for whom she was running. Cause of death of this fit, slim 30 year old hairdresser who had already run a marathon before, is still unknown.So should we be advising patients to avoid extreme sports and marathon runnning? There have been 10 deaths during the Londonmarathon since its inception in 1981(no data on the week or so after). The last death was in 2007when a 22-year-old fitness instructor died of hyponatraemia,presumably due to overdrinking. Most fatalities are due to undiagnosed underlying heart problems (would that be conduction problems in the young?)Given the numbers running, the fatality rate is reassuringly low. I suppose the question is whether an ecg to check for conduction defect and/ or echo to look for cardiomyopathy are worthwhile before embarking on training for a marathon. The pick up rate's going to be very low but is there any down side (apart from time,money and false reassurance)? Certainly, if there's a family history of sudden death, should we suggest investigations?I've just run my first and last marathon at the age of 52. My dad dropped dead of a heart attack at 48 but I figured that if I didnt get any chest pain while training, I'd probably be ok. And I was. I didn't really consider having any checkups before.

The resources required to detect the first would also be excessive, while the care and observation to prevnt the second might be, and I am sure have been, instituted in marathons.John-gwsjjjjjjjjj25a	John D	25/4/2012 2:56 PM	0	0
1071	234	1	Hi Ann,Firstly, congratulations on your first marathon. It is a gargantuan effort and I'm sure positions you well to understand the duress the body is placed under before, during and after such trials.There are a few intersting points here. Of course, the marvellous case of Fabrice Muamba highlights the stark contrast in possible outcomes. Tragic or miraculous, these are sensational stories for the media that distort the reality of the risks involved - expert, politically unmotivated and media-free opinion can be the only guide here...But does knowing actually help? Are we able to predict those at risk accurately enough to avoid the psychologically and physically detrimental effects of knowing that if you push it too hard, you could die?When I was at school, there was a boy in my house called Richard van Rossum who knew he had a deadly cardiac arrhythmia. He had an internal defibrillator/pacing device. He was a marvellous guy, full of spirit, and very active. He played many sports and did so well. And with all that, he collapsed and died running to a History lesson. It was a huge shock, especially considering the circumstances, but something he and his family understood could happen. His father, an Olympic hurdler, continued to coach at the school for a few years after his death, which was such a typically selfless gesture of the family and was hugely appreciated.What can you do?-my0bu0bqb6cyb8d9f3	hip radiologist	25/4/2012 2:56 PM	0	0

Clearly the benefits of physical activity greatly outweigh the slightly increased risk ofsudden death while exercising. In older people the most common causes of sudden death are ischaemic heart disease in contrast to those in younger people. In Italy, sports club members need to be screened. In France, you need to provide a note/certificate to say you are fit to exercise (How a doctordecidesis another issue!). In the UK, you just turn up. Should people be screened?

1077	234	1	I do have problems with the concept of road running per se (as opposed to running on fields, beaches or forestry tracks) bcause I think, even with the best training shoes, you are doing repeated damage to you ankles, knees, hips and lumbar spine which will come back to haunt you. I know it from first hand experience. I spent my youth playing football, tennis, squash, volleyball, basket ball, etc. on an almost daily basis but almost always on hard surface such as clay. Now in my late 40s my knees and hips hurt :-(I don't run myself (my sore knees and hips now prefer yoga and non-weighbearing activities like swimming) but I am led to believe by friends who do run seriously that you should change your running shoes every 8 weeks if you are a serious runner otherwise all their support has gone.

1078	234	1	Here is an answer to the question about what the causes are of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young (it's from BJSM (Br J Sports Med) http://tiny.cc/e97bdwA broad spectrum of cardiac and non-cardiac causes, both congenital and  acquired, have been implicated in causing SCA in athletes.Datafrom  the USA and Italy indicate that structural cardiac disease accounts  for 6095% of the causes of SCA,21,,23  and mainly includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrythmogenic right  ventricular dysplasia and congenital coronary artery                                  anomalies in the under-35-year-old  group.Coronary artery disease predominatesin the over-35-year-old group. Common pathway in all these conditions isventricular                                  fibrillation (VF) as the main  presenting rhythm in SCA.24 In the under-16-year-old age group, commotio cordis (cardiac contusion) is thought to be responsible for up to 20% of SCAs.                                  It is very uncommon after 21 years of age.25 26. Other cardiac causes of SCA  include myocarditis, ruptured aortic aneurysm, aortic valve                                  stenosis, mitral valve prolapse,  dilated cardiomyopathy, drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias and the  ion-channelopathies29  which include the long and short QT syndrome (caused by sodium or  potassium ion channel genetic mutations), Brugada syndrome                                  (defective sodium channel gene) and  familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia30 (abnormal ryanodine receptor regulating calcium release). Non-cardiac causes of SCA include asthma, heat stroke, cerebral                                  artery rupture and exertional rhabdomyolysis secondary to sickle cell trait. via Karim Khan,MBBS,PhD - editor, BJSM-ld1ce62aib2e24daaaaaaaaaaaaapf352227l2	KKhan	25/4/2012 9:26 PM	0	0

1082	237	1	In general , I think those identifying problems should offer at least one potential solution , but on this issue I fail. I cannot believe that the media suggestion that we just provide transport to Europe is sensible. By providing transport , I mean that European ships just hover around and as soon as the overloaded ships founder we pick folk out of the sea and bring them to Europe. If that why not just arrange to collect them (and perhaps their fees ) in the first place?   Nor do I see that the UN can simply wash its hands and regard this as a local problem.   The population explosion due to hit Africa means that some solution needs to be found. At what level does it provide a real threat to the stability of receiving countries - a half million ? 1 million? 2-3 million?   I am left with the feeling that it is the apparently preventable nature of these deaths and their portrayal in the media which is being used t produce a particular public reaction - the numbers of preventable malaria deaths is far greater but more out of sight.   A subsidiary question is that many of these migrants seem to be highly motivated individuals with skills. Perhaps the very folk that Africa needs most at the moment?   Any suggestions about how to provide a solution?-gp7	sken	3/5/2015 7:00 PM	0	0
1083	238	1	Following on from the boxing debate, this editorial fromThe BMJ brings up the equally controversial topic of American football and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).   The authors posing this questiona director of sports medicine and a professor of family medicine from the USmention that the NFL recently paid $870m (578m,822m) to former players who claimed their neurological deficits were from playing the sport.   They say that over the past 60 years there have only been 63 autopsy confirmed cases of CTE in American football players, and there is currently no diagnostic test that can confirm it in living people. However, they conclude that, despite such uncertainties, we urgently need strategies to reduce concussive head impacts in American football.-7bu2kkcma7vn0fq3369ihcax066	Sabreena	31/3/2015 7:02 PM	2	0
1084	238	1	I know you're talking American football here butI read somewhere that some rugby tackles can have the same impact as being involved in a 30mph crash.   This all stems from the evolution of the game 20-25 years ago whenit was on the cusp of going professional. The big players on the pitch used to be the 2nd rows at 6ft 5, 6ft 6. Some positions (scrum half for example) were as small as 5ft 6, wingers were around 5ft 10. This all changed when Jonah Lomu came on the scene in the mid 90s. He was a 6ft 5, 19 stone winger who could run 100m in 11s. The smallest player on a rugby pitch is now around 6ft. Props are now 6ft 5. The 2nd rows have beefed up too. Richie Gray is 6ft 10, Devin Toner is 6ft 11, Luke Charteris is 6ft 11 and 20 stone.   Everyone is bigger and tackles harder making the head injuries more severe.   Seriously though, how can you realistically reduce concussive head impacts in this or other contact sports without fundamentally changing the game?-fozy2	Mikey W	31/3/2015 9:57 PM	2	0

The helmet, and other gear will reduce contact injuries, but spinal twisting and torsioning will occur due to the most basic principals of physics, and Math.

1088	238	1	Of course you do, Duane, you're a sportsman, but the Olympics,an amateur sport?  Pull the other one!   In all countries, I think, that can afford it, Olympic class sportspeople are paid to pursue their sport, in the National Interest.  For instance, the British Olympic Association set up UK Sport specifically to raise funds and support 'elite' athletes in the years up to 2012, with salaries and facilities and the objective of winning more Olympic medals.  And it worked. Team GB won SEVENTY TWO per cent more medals than it did in Beijing, at a cost of 4.5 MILLION per medal, over 264 million overall.   I don't know how much America spent, but niether country treated its elite athletes as amateurs.  The justification for this ENORMOUS cost is in the enthusiasm for sport that it raises in sports people, like you and me, and in people who didn't do sport, except watch. I have to say it's been patchy: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/10200815/What-has-been-London-2012s-legacy-for-the-Olympic-sports-a-year-after-the-Games.html but it's there.   In most sports then, I think that there is an argument for professionalism at the elite level, for National Pride and to encourage participation lower down the sport.  Some sports seem to suffer from it, though.  Soccer has been professional since Adam kicked a bladder, and look at it!  In the UK at least, narcissistic and wildly over paid, from vast ticket prices charged (non-playing) fans and sponsorship deals larger than small countries' GDP.  Rugby may not be there yet, but the question has been asked, is it makking elite rugby players too strong for their own good, by causing each other long term injury?

1089	239	1	"We have heard of thre distressingly high incidence of brain injury that accumulates in those who play American Football, but maybe reassure ourselves that rugby, that game for hooligans ghat is played with such sporting courtesy and comradeship, unlike the round ball game, is free of such risk.  That is despite such heroes of rugby as Bill Beaumont being told by his doctors that he should stop playing, after a history of recurrent concussion incidents.  Beaumont did retire and has continued a successful media and business career, thank goodness, but such injuries as wel las spjnal injuries do continue, in the lower levels of rugby as well as at Internationals.   But we know almost nothing about what is happening to rugby players, routinely in every game, that sometimes can cause such destating injury.  But the door is opening. A recent paper in the Am.J.Sportsd Med. recorded ther use of ""instrumented mouth guards"" (gum shields) over a whole season of club rugby in New Zealand. And its horrifying! http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535096   Only 38 senior club players wore the guards, and suffered over 20,000 impacts that inflicted more than 10g. The paper compared this with work done on male American Football players at all levels and on female soccer players, and found that the rugby players' impacts were similar, but less than the women footballers!   And ther worl ciontinues. Saracens RFC are coopertaing with an American company by having all its players in what is no longer a gentlemanly amateur sport but fully professional, by wearing stick-on accelerometers, just under the ear.

1091	239	1	I think, Pat, that investigations are at such an early stage, that it's too soon to even think about how the Game might be changed. we have to know where and when these impacts occur, before that can happen.  It has changed, a lot since we played, principally by going professional and the players , even Internationals, are much fitter, heavier and stronger, if not one wit tougher than we were!  The potential for injury is greater, as the need for the changes in scrum rules has sought to alleviate.   I'd like to see the same investigations in League Rugby, with its rare formal scrums and minimal scrummages, but where astounding tackles are seen that would, in the phrase, fell a bull, but from which the players get up and play on.

In Graeco-Roman & Freestyle Wrestling there is win by injury. Apart from Olympic sports, in Sumo certain dietary regimens are imposed to result in what could be medically called 'obesity'. WWE, and mixed martial arts (MMA) can result in significant injuries.   I understand that virtually any sport can result in injury but there are huge differences between the extents of injury even in combative sports and martial arts. eg   Compare motocross to cycling, the injuries of motocross and other motorcycle races can be fatal, cycling can result in injuries but the frequency is less, the impact is less and certainly not as life threatening as motorcycling. Even in combative sports Boxing injuries can result un much more frequency and intensity of damage (esp. irreversible ones) than Judo.

1096	241	1	Magnet therapy, magnetic therapy, or magnotherapy is an alternative medicine practice involving the use of magnetic fields. Practitioners claim that subjecting certain parts of the body to magnetostatic fields produced by permanent magnets has beneficial health effects.These pseudoscientific physical and biological claims are unproven and no effects on health or healing have been established.Although haemoglobin is weakly diamagnetic when oxygenated and paramagnetic when deoxygenated, the magnets used in magnetic therapy are too weak to have any measurable effect on blood flowClaimed benefit :-Greater resistance to infectionIt helps to remove waste products from the blood ie lactic acid calcium and cholesterolIt increases energy and strengthIt helps recovery or can prevent onset of R.S.I.

1097	241	1	"I am always at doubt when a certain method offers cure for many different disorders.However, some of the alternative therapies have certain effects, be it because of placebo effect and the urge to believe it does work, or for other obscure reasons.Little serous research was done on those methods.We know for instance that acupuncture can help reduce pain and there are also other alternative modalities.In past, there were healers who were collecting certain leaves, mixing them and applying them to wounds or making from them a potion for the sick. Science helped us to realise later that those herbs contain various active chemical substances and we learned how to manufacture those in labs and medications appeared with dosages, etc.If we think along similar lines, let us suppose that the healer using a certain magnet is actuallly like the healer who prepared potions from leaves. The healer has no idea what exactly works, but for some reason it helps certain patients. Now let us take a little dive into the subatomic world of modern quantum physics with the theories of certain energy fields at work, of matter being actually also waves, string theory and membrane theory etc, about the true nature of our reality , and let us suppose that some action actually does something on that level, altering the matter-wave in a certain way as to ""tune"" it differently, and perhaps there is your effect on subatomic level, creating a change on atomic- molecular level.But we simply don't know yet how to manage it, how to achieve the desired effect..Perhaps in the future we will learn how to elicit certain effects that will lead to improvement or cure on those complicated levels.Just as we learned to make the chemical substance from the leaves. Only now we are on the ""leaves"" level with magnetotherapy and other alternative therapies.And perhaps all these really don't work and what we witness is placebo effect. But then how far can we actually boost up a placebo effect?"	yoram chaiter	28/8/2012 10:53 PM	0	0
1098	241	1	"Magnetic treatment is of two kinds, local and general, depending on whether          the disease is localized or all-inclusive. The palms or the soles of the          feet are placed on two magnets with different poles and the patient is          exposed to them for 10 minutes a day, preferably in the morning before          breakfast. Chronic cases take half-an-hour a day. The precautions are          cursory: no ingestion of anything cold an hour after treatment, no bathing          for two hours after. Strong magnets should not be applied to pregnant          women and to the heart and the brain.One of the reasons for magnet therapy's growing popularity is that there is          no paucity of therapists and teachers.A magnet can also be used without looking like an awkward prosthesisa          hearing aid, or worse still, a crutch. You can go jogging wearing a magnetic          headband (""improve your memory on the run""); you can grace parties wearing          magnetic necklaces made of silver and gunmetal in India, and gold in Australiathese          chokers treat bronchitis and protect against an asthmatic attack. Magnetic          earrings and pendants guard against an under-active thyroid. Magnetic          goggles are handsome add-ons that double as cures for conjunctivitis and          glaucoma, and help reduce visual defects. If you are a pretty spinster          and insistent suitors are raising your BP, a magnetic ring will work like          magic-ridding you of both. And magnets as gifts allow you to be idiosyncratic          without being over-the-top. There is, of course, a catch to magnet therapy: outside of orthopedics,          it is an unpredictable, sporadic success. It is still a system of the          last resort: its patients are most often refugees from other therapies. Often chronic cases come to us after having          tried all other systems and expect quick relief. What is also missing is rigor and research. Practitioners lack a scientific system of analysis. We don't document          our cases, which is absolutely necessary for research. So what is missing from this therapy is not magnetic appeal but the kind          of scientific zealotry that attracts both funding and practitioners.

1105	241	1	I am abeliever! Back in 2004 I got very sick, had two bleeding ulcers and mybody stopped processing stress. I was on 5 medications,proton pump inhibitors, xanax, valium, etc. I was amess. I went on vacation to Yellowstone and there was a magnetic jeweler there. I bought a couple of bracelets because I liked the looks and design and figured it couldnt hurt.Shortly after, I began feeling better. Istopped the meds that they were giving me and didn't have problems with stress or anxiety like I was having. I am not saying that it stopped instantaniously. I still had problems, but they were greatly reduced. I started purchasing other magnetic products, such as a magnetic knee brace. It was a total life saver. I have degenerative arthritis in my knees and when they flaired up, I could barely walk, even with normal braces on. The magnetic brace helped to relieve the pain within 20 minutes, and greatly reduced the length between flair ups. I now swear by them!

Do these sporting events inspire you to be more healthy and take more exercise? Or are the elite athletes so beyond your reach that you feel there's no point trying?   There has been a definite increase in the number of cyclists out on the roadts here in the UK, presumably inspired by the success of Bradley Wiggins and other British cyclists but whether there is a direct correlation is probably hard to prove. It's probably a combination of sporting success and clever marketing.   A study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine looking at whether the 2000 Sydney Olympics increased levels of physical activity among adults concluded that evidence to support this remained ""elusive."" One-off sporting events are not the answer. ""Without multiyear integrated and well-funded programmes to promote physical activity, the Olympic legacy of a more active community may remain more rhetoric than reality,"" the authors concluded.

1113	243	1	yas,   I think you need to reassess your priorities. You have just started a course of study that will lead to medical qualification, and is one of the longest and most onerous of any profession. If you are studying in the UK, you will be acculmulating debt or paying more than 9000 a year for that priviledge. I would suggest that you will be able to afford additional course and have a little (a little!) more time to indulge other interests after you qualify.   I have no idea of where being a Personal Trainer would fit into the job of Sports Doctor. I have the impression from talking to SM specialist at sports eventsthat the Trainer defers to the doctor, especially one trained in sports medicine.

1118	246	1	"Matthew Billington recently started a thread on doping in football, where I suggested that Sport was nowadays business, and a business as cut-throat as any Mafia turf war.http://doc2doc.bmj.com/forums/open-clinical_sport-exercise-medicine_footballers-injections-pills-play-through-pain-barrierWehave the Armstrong affair, the Australian Crime Commission's report on organised crime in sport medicine, the Dr. Eufemiano Fuentes affair (cycling again) and now an admission from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) that they are losing the battle. Not a section of the newspaper I normally read, as it is 95% football, but today's Guardian (16/2/12) devotes a third of its sports section to this problem.Read the leadeditorial here, with lots of links to the other articles:http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/feb/15/drugs-wada-organised-crime?INTCMP=SRCHI met many sports medicine specialists at the Olympics who had similar concerns that they were willing to speakabouttothis outsider, so doping is a wide-open secret in the specialty. And we had a thread here about acceding to patient demands for treatment, which are easier to resist when the patient is not the doctor's employer. But a team doctor's job depends on their doing what the team demands, and in a small specialty it may be hard to find another post if the team sacks adoctor who will not act illegally or unethically.The doctor is the single common pathway insport doping, so WADA should concentrate on them, and doctors not in the specialty should support our colleagues who are, for the goodname of medicine. It would be futile to suggest an ""NHS"" in world sport, when so many countries have no state health mechanism. But the money is there to employ sports specialists and WADA should take hold of that.Any team that wishes to employ a sports doctor should be obliged to pay their salary and employment costs into a WADA held Trust. At the same time, WADA should set up an independentcertification Board to oversee the qualification and conduct of sports specialists, in international sport. The Trust would employ the doctor, andthe Board certifytheir conduct.Clearly there are plenty of international funding bodies in sport whose morals and standards leave much to be desired. FIFA (football), the IOC in the past, the many boxing bodiesand of course the ICU (cycling) have been as blind as Nelson to blatant misdeeds, but WADA is an organisation set up specifically to prevent crime, and I hope that it would be able to resist internal corruption.John-6h0e7iaa4o8jfc8da2ma5mwdugrfsj0bxgtbr7"	John D	16/2/2013 9:57 AM	0	0
1119	247	1	This is about living in extreme environments, but not strictly about medicine, although good nutritious food is necessary for health.   I was working the garage today, idling listening to the radio.  The Food Programme is usually a rather smug event, about 'good food', hand reared meat and vegetables, artisanal bread and the like.  This one was completely different, presented by Gerald Baker, a chef who volunteered to serve on the British Anatarctic Survey's Halley VI Base in 2014.  He was there in the middle of the Antarctic winter when a main heating pipe burst, disabling the heating to most of the Base while the outside temperature was -35C.   Halley VI is unique.  The station on the Brunt Ice Shelf was first occupied in 1956.  The wooden huts were considered disposable, because the ice shelf moves away from the shore and eventually breaks off as icebergs that float away into he Southern Ocean and melt.  Meanwhile snow accumulates on the shelf, burying the huts.  At some points in its history, 'huts' 40 feet below the surface have been still in use, but eventually the weight of the ice crushes them.  Halley IV was designed to step aside from the cycle of rebuilding new accomodation on the surface further away from the edge of the ice, by being mounted on giant skis, themselves on hydraulic legs.   When needs must, and they do, right now, as Halley is presently being movedhttps://www.bas.ac.uk/project/moving-halley/, it is towed by tractors to the new site.   But in 2014, the loss of heating to the Base was potentially catastrophic.   Heat is the first essential in that awful place. Worse, access to the burst was only possible from outside, in darkness and temperatures that meant the engineers could not work for more than a short time.  This event was like only to Apollo 13 - rescue was impossible, no ship or aircraft could get there - and there were nearly five times as many crew at risk.  Their existence and the future of Halley Base, the most advanced extreme-environment dwelling in the world was at risk. Only they could save themselves.  Surely they will make a film of this?   After nearly 24 hours, the Base engineers eventually were able to rig a jury repair, without which all scientific work at the Base would have stopped and the crew reduced to living in the garage, where a small independent heater kept the vehicles from freezing.   Our gallant cook devised ways of making meals on expedition camp stoves as after warmth, hot food was the next requirement. His understated account is in the finest British tradition of chin up and make do!   I had never heard of this dramatic story! It did appear in the news at the time, and escaped me, but it cannot have received the attention it deserved, perhaps because of that finest British tradition, that minimises the best and worst that life can throw.    I think anyone could enjoy this edition of the Food Programme, without any interest in food, Antarctica or science!

1120	248	1	Nepalese Diploma in Mountain Medicine is a post graduate course proposed to be run by the Mountain Medicine Society of Nepal (MMSN). This course is approved by the Union Internationale des Associations dAlpinisime(UIAA) , International Society of Mountain Medicine (ISMM) and International Commission for Alpine Rescue(IKAR).In Oct-Nov 2010, afeasibility studyfor the Diploma was done in Kathmandu and the Khumbu region of Nepal with support from theMedex. Potential sites were visited in person and areportwas presented to the local and international stakeholders. Following this, a straight 4 weeks curriculum was developed.The course will start on November 9th, 2011 and last until December 8th, 2011.The first week of the course will be organized in Kathmandu and the rest three weeks in Thame valley of the Everest region. We are now acceptingapplicationfor the course.Besides the theoretical part, the diploma encompasses practical hands on skills on rope techniques, surviving skills, rescue techniques, practical traumatology and practical advice from the international instructors. Qualified instructors and mountain guides deliver the course in English.The main aim of this course is to train Nepalese doctors in the home country with syllabus tailored to suit the local needs without compromising international standards.The Nepalese Diploma is supported by the Medical Expeditions, Swiss Mountain Society, Alpine Club-UK, Porters Progress UK and many other individuals and organizations.Linkhttp://mmsn.org.np/dimm/Disclaimer: I'm associated with Mountain Medicine Society of Nepal and the content was taken from the society's website.

And B/ for my own concern that at 0330, when I've been awake for nineteen hours, that I can really be a reliable leader of a critical care team. Both of those would let me down one day as I got older- I was determined that I should stop doing it before anyone else told me I was not up to it.As for going onworking, in daylight hours and at times of my own choice, or at least at times that I have agreed to work, I hope to continue, part time. But I will monitor my own performance critically. If I ever, EVER, think that I have not done well, that's it, I'm off, to tend my garden or whatever. There is no place in medicine for out-of-date, over-the-hill doctors, who either are not up to date with modern techniques or who cannot make decisions under pressure.

1136	251	1	Dear all   we have a baby who contracted severe pneumococcal meningitis in dec 2013 and suffered an extensive vasculitic infarct. Amongst other problems , he struggles to maintain his temperature despite the environmental temperature. Hence we are very restricted with regards where we can go etc      we have a Bair huger and wheattie bags but of course these need an electrical supply. Other than hot water bottles and layers of clothing, does anyone have any ideas about how to increase his temperature if it drops and we don't have a power supply? Are there any battery operated devices anyone knows of?   many thanks-ir	Messenger	10/9/2014 12:12 PM	0	0

1141	252	1	23 yo young lady with known hypermobolity syndrome, who has booked a trip to kilimanjaro and was told that diamox may be useful for her trek. As a GP would you prescribe it, evenly privately ?	NinjaSan	25/7/2011 7:04 AM	0	0
1142	252	1	Hi NinjaSan,Thanks for the query here. I would like to apologize that this query seemed unnoticed - longer than we usually respond here.Yes you can suggest Acetazolamide to her for Kilimanjaro. Kilimanjoro hike is really rapid and too high as per the schedules/stations I was given by one of the visiters a couple of years ago.However, please, make sure she is not allergic to Sulfonamide moiety containing drugs (sulfa drugs) and her kidney is fine. She should not be diabetic to go altitude and take diamox.I have not read any adverse or aggravating condition with hypermobility and diamox...worth exploring.Increasing urinary out, tingling, numbness, flat taste esp cola drinks should be mentioned. Almost all get this.You could advise either 500mg two divided doses daily starting one day prior ascent (night before) or 250mg two divided doses as earlier can help. --- or there might other regimen which you can look into.http://accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aid=9151473I hope this helps.matiPS: I'm not GP but worked as clinician at altitude.-2r1a24	Matiram Pun	17/8/2011 8:15 AM	0	0

Also three others were reported died the same day!Everest was first summitted 59 years ago by Edmund Hillary and  Tenzing Norgay, who reached the top on the morning of May 29, 1953. The  pair are believed to have been the first people to do so. Since then, approximately 3,000 people have attempted the feat and  more than 200 have died trying. However, due to the difficulties posed  by recovery, a dangerous and expensive endeavour, the bodies of many remain on the mountainside.	Dr. K. Ashutosh	9/6/2012 10:37 PM	0	0

1155	253	1	Everest deaths - body recovery a difficult and dangerous endeavour!! Of course - BUT - where hascompassion gone from these people? There should be some way of providing teams to recover bodies funded by a levy on the climbers themselves - if one has paid 25000 as recently reported to join a large group, then perhaps a levy of 5000 each paid to the authiorites, not the tour operators, could be appropriate.-y0kz8jd	jdbaines	23/5/2013 3:52 PM	0	0

1157	254	1	The prevention and treatment of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)is waranted when one has to ascend quickly or somebody who is at the risk of it while enjoying mountains (hiking/trekking/climbing/pilgrimmage etc.). The well tested and tried drug for it is: Diamox (Acetazolamide)!!! There have been numerous studies (RCTs) and the drug is in use for multiple other conditions (e.g. glaucoma oras a diuretic).The meta-analysis in 2000 by Dumont et al published in BMJ caused much of controversy than giving a solution. Many field researchers, clinicians and reputed high altitude medicine experts expressed their views in it. Dumont et al, BMJ, 2000: [http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7256/267]Responses: http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7256/267?tab=responsesThe analysis rather came into a controversial conclusion with larger dose of Acetazolamide and even doubting the effecacy of it in prevention AMS. The analysis could have been skewed with the study selection (inclusion/exclusion) criteria!This year: 2012; we by now see four big meta-analyses on this topic (which is great):1. Seaupaul et al, AEM, 2012: http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(11)01700-8/abstract 2. Kayser et al, HAMB, 2012: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ham.2011.10843. Ritchie et al, JTM, 2012: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1708-8305.2012.00629.x/abstractand finally in BMJ4. Low et al, BMJ, 2012: http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6779xxxThe second review this year in a high altitude specific journal is by the assciated group who reviewed in 2000 in BMJ (Dumont et al) and they come with similar conclusion. This is strange that the journal that has been dedicated to altiude biology and medicine could not get better, rigorous and updated reviews. First (Seaupaul et al, AEM, 2012) and third (Ritchie et al, JTM, 2012) one have been published in general clinical journals and fairly well covered. I would say, the authors have done great job. It is good that they have been in the journals that clinicians will read and practice. Ithink we are pretty much done with these kind of meta-analyses for few years to come unless we see flurry of new trials coming up in next couple of years. The message is out there: loud and clear!The final and recent one in BMJ (Low et al, BMJ, 2012) is taking the topic a bit further ahead. I think they have simply ignored to the controversies (especially if it is effective?) and gone to look into Acetazolamide dosages (and by looking into it, they would also answer about that unprecedented large dose recommendation). This will put a final nail in the coffin of debatewhether Acetazolamideiseffictive to prevent AMSand if we need that high dosage. It is good that it has been in a pretty reputed journal like BMJ and we will take it. I think BMJ had to do this especially when they had published the first controversial one and the debate was ongoing. The conclusive step ....we will see ! The strength of review is further consolidated with the association some of the authors who are actually renowned altitude experts. Future work or questions will be about uses of this lowest dosage in rapid ascents as concluded here by Low et al. Rapid ascent is the condition where we need it more. I would be happier if future works are directed in investigating new preventive and therapeutic drugs in altitude illness along with Diamox. Due to its (Diamox's) Sulfa moeity (can't be used by those who have sulfa allergy) and other side effects, we will need to explore options/alternatives to it.Abstract of BMJ meta-analysis:======================AbstractObjectives To assess the efficacy of three different daily doses of acetazolamide in the prevention of acute mountain sickness and to determine the lowest effective dose.Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.Data sources Medline and Embase along with a hand search of selected bibliographies. No language restrictions were applied.Study selection Randomised controlled trials assessing the use of acetazolamide at 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg daily versus placebo in adults as a drug intervention for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness. Included studies were required to state the administered dose of acetazolamide and to randomise participants before ascent to either acetazolamide or placebo. Two reviewers independently carried out the selection process.Data extraction Two reviewers extracted data concerning study methods, pharmacological intervention with acetazolamide, method of assessment of acute mountain sickness, and event rates in both control and intervention groups, which were verified and analysed by the review team collaboratively.Data synthesis 11 studies (with 12 interventions arms) were included in the review. Acetazolamide at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg were all effective in preventing acute mountain sickness above 3000 m, with a combined odds ratio of 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.46). At a dose of 250 mg daily the number needed to treat for acetazolamide to prevent acute mountain sickness was 6 (95% confidence interval 5 to 11). Heterogeneity ranged from I2=0% (500 mg subgroup) to I2=44% (750 mg subgroup).Conclusions Acetazolamide in doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily are all more effective than placebo for preventing acute mountain sickness. Acetazolamide 250 mg daily is the lowest effective dose to prevent acute mountain sickness for which evidence is available. ======================-o16lsk60doqvacy2	Matiram Pun	19/10/2012 1:36 AM	0	0

1164	254	1	Hi Carolin,We were focussed about Prevention/Prophylaxis here. But confusion arises because Acetazolamide is effective in both treatment and prevention.Hence, it is trekker/climber's or his/her physician's call to wait for the symptoms and go for the treatment OR use prophylactically! Usally, a day before (night before) you start ascending would be better time to start for prophylaxis.Yes, cases are plenty when you are up and above of 3500m altitude.

1167	256	1	Hello all,First a caveat - I'm not a clinician - I work for BMJ in a technical capacity and have just returned from Nepal where I was doing some walking and climbing. Below is an account of an incident I was involved in. I'd appreciate opinions on what we might do differently in future, and any lessons it might have for others.We were walking the Annapurna circuit, and my group of four friends had fallen in with a few other groups of trekkers, so that there were nine in the group. One of these had hired a guide. Otherwise, we were all trekking without guides or porters. On 5th January we were walking from Yak Kharka to Thorung Phedi, at roughly 4800m. A young man (28 years old??) who was part of the group stumbled on an eroded section of path at 3pm, and fell approx 30m down a steep (60 degree?) section of gravel/scree slope. He came to rest in sight, and appeared unconscious. One person remaining on the path, reported some movement after about 5 minutes.I climbed down to him, which took me around 20 minutes. He was lying head downward on his right side. He had one open skull fracture of about 3 inches on the top right of his head, which I covered with a glove and applied pressure. I put my down jacket on him, and asked him to blink if he could hear me. This he did, but I could not get a verbal response or any movement from him. I continued to talk to him, cut his rucksack off, and tried to move him gently to a head up position, but couldn't - he was too heavy, and I didn't want to let go of his head. I carefully inspected his head, and found further large skull fractures on the top and back of his head. I tried to cover these and applied pressure. Unable to do much else, I waited for about 15 minutes, at which point four Nepalis from Thorung Phedi arrived.They immediately lifted him and carried him rapidly down the last part of the slope to the flat river bed and set him down. I then asked them to retrieve his rucksack, remove as much clothing/sleeping bag etc as possible and put it on and under him. I again inspected his head more carefully, and found further injuries, maybe 4 large open fractures in total, one separate, the others joining to the pressumed impact point at the back/top of his head. I removed my hat and tried to cover all of them with my hand. Bleeding was continuing, but not massively - I was more worried about hypothermia than blood loss at this point. (Later, in hospital they gave him 2 units of blood)After an hour, he started to move his left leg in sporadic bicycle kick movements, and make groaning noises. He never moved his right side at all, and I assumed it was paralysed. Breathing seemed fine, and he started to move his head occasionally. At 4pm the valley came into shadow, and the temperature dropped rapidly. I noticed that his skull was easily depressed, and when he moved the bleeding tended to restart. I was concerned about not pressing his skull into his brain, but also wanted to stop the bleeding. He vomitted once at about 4.00pm, and I didn't see any signs of blood. I cleared his airway. During this time I tried to keep talking to him, and reassuring him. Two members of our group arrived with more down clothing at 4.30pm. At 5.15pm, more Nepalis arrived from High Camp (above Thorung Phedi) with material for a stretcher. It was essentially dark by the time we got him on to it. I attempted to fix my hat and gloves over his head wounds with duct tape and some bandages for the stretcher journey.Carrying him up to Thorung Phedi was very hard, and would have been almost impossible without the assistance of the locals who were many times stronger than any of us. Even so, they had to rest 2-3 times on the way. He vomitted again while we were carrying him.There was no power at Thorung Phedi, and the temperature dropped to -15c that night. We put him in a room and all 9 of us say with him through the night. Our body heat was a very effective heater, and the room remained (slightly) above 0c all night. By now, he could answer yes/no questions, but continued kicking movements with his left leg, and some uncontrolled left arm movements. We checked pulse and temperature hourly. Pulse constant at 122 per minute, and temperature roughly constant around 36.0c.We got him to swallow, and gave him water via a sponge into his mouth. At first he swallowed about 300ml in 2-3 hours but vomitted it up again. We reduced the rate, and got him to retain about 250ml over the course of the night. I removed the hat/glove bandage and applied iodine soaked gauze, which we took turns holding in place by hand - he found pressure painful, and bleeding had pretty much stopped by now. And it helped keep us awake! We changed bandages maybe once or twice more over the night.We had some oral painkiller - possibly tramadol, but it was a German brand name if so (lent by another trekker). We applied the maximum dose (30 drops every 6 hours, something like that), which appeared to have only slight effect, but the patient asked for more, so it must have done something!We kept him away and answering questions all night. As his alertness slowly improved, so did his apparent discomfort. He often contradicted himself with the yes/no answers, so it was hard to find out the areas of pain/discomfort. We had reached a telephon in Ledar (below us) at around 4.00pm, and were promised a helicopter at 6.30 am the next day - first light. In the end, the chopper arrived at 9.45am - a very frustrating wait, with a fear it might not come at all for some reason!We again stretchered him to to landing zone and loaded him on. This time I found a triangular banadage and did a slightly better job of fixing his dressings to his head! Two young American women he had been travelling in also went into the chopper to help with arrangements at the other end.Result---------He reached Kathmandu on the 6th, and his mother in Canada was contacted 2hrs later. She agreed to immediate surgery. Fragments of bone had entered his brain. These were removed, and his skull stapled (48 staples, I think he told me!). Amazingly, no other injuries beyong a large bruise over his eye, and small cuts.I saw the patient on 14th Jan. He was still paralysed on the right hand side, and seemed to have quite bad pain for an unknown reason in his left shoulder. He could form short sentences, but still had speech problems. He was cheerful, laughed at our cruel jokes, and seemed to be doing pretty well, considering. Apparently CAT scans showed some dead brain tissue, but that's 3rd hand information, so should be taken with caution.My thoughts:a) I probably should have paid more attention to cleaning the wound. I don't know why I didn't think to make an iodine solution and wash it.b) At 3pm it was warm and sunny. I wasn't expecting to be there holding his head for 2.5hrs. I should have taken my own sleeping bag, and a head torch. (We ended up stretchering him in the dark, with only one or two torches between all of us available)c) Put more proper wound dressings in my first aid kit (I only had one). The gauze bandages stick to the wound, and the material caught caught up in bone framents. Messy.Any thoughts or questions very welcome. The doctors in Kathmandu were somewhat surprised he survived the night!P.S. His medical insurance was excellent, they never queried any cost, and have also paid out for much greater nursing care than is standard in the hospital.	Jon Peterson	16/1/2013 1:59 PM	0	0

1169	256	1	"I completely agree with Carolin!That he is alive and has at least one side of his body working is a tribute to your care! It is very easy to criticise, so please take my comments in the spirit of admiring attempts to fine tune your performance.A is for Airway. In someone with severly impaired conciousness after a fall, the first care should be to ensure that their breathing is unobstructed. You may have been able to see this and pass it by. The next in the aidememoire is B for Breathing - are they, by themselves? - and C for Circulation. You can add D for Disability, which you immediately noted and E for Exposure, to ensure that all injuries are known, a step too far in the situation you found him in, but appropriate later.In such a fall, we must expect neck and spinal cord injury.You did the right thing by supporting and holding his head still, but I would have left him in the prone position, airway allowing, until help arrived. Only then and perhaps beforemoving him off the ledge would it be possible to place a neck immobilising collar on him.Injury further down the spine is equally possible in such a fall. ""Log turning"" - turning the patient in such a way that the spine is not twisted - needs at least six people, maybe impossible on the ledge, but will safeguard the spinal cord from further injury. And immobilisation of the spine, during transport. Gosh, I don't know how you could have improvised a spinal stretcher. I know that Nepal has little in the way of trees, so lashing him to a stretcher of branches probably wasn't an option.I'm beginning to feel awful now! Here I am advocating ideal, western world management when you were half way up a Himalaya! You did fine!You will almost certainly never be called upon to repeat your feat! But to deal with the injuries that are more likely to come your way, you may want to equip yourself with a few items of equipment, that should be light and small, for inclusion in your pack. I would suggest:Melolin dressings - they don't stick to the wound.A SAM splint - a roll of foam covered aluminium sheet, that when unrolled, formed around a broken limb and bandaged on, makes an excellent splint. Can also be used as a neck collar, or cut with scissors to make smaller, say finger, splints.Chitosan dressings or powder. The standard treatment for severe bleeding is, as you did, pressure, but this can be used with pressure to promote the formation of asealing blood clot that makes transport easier. I think, but am not sure, that it is safe to use on an open head injury. I'd couple that with a CAT (Combat Application Tourniquet), that can be applied with one hand (it might be you!) to allow temporary control of severe bleeding while other treatments are started.Further, I suggest that your exploit deserves publication in the BMJ, where it might be accompanied by a discussion of the problem of head and spinal injury at altitude from a more qualified pre-hospital care practitioner than I, or a medical mountaineer.Altogether, well done!John-mc3fa3lsf3ba3h3laaa5ma3a8maa0ra5c1d6ha5ga5f0va7ja8kzbaa7e"	John D	16/1/2013 7:04 PM	0	0

1171	256	1	Hi Jon Peterson,First of all, thank you for visiting Nepal and hiking in Nepal Himalayas. I hope you had wonderful time (except this event). Secondly, you have done great job and excellent impromptu skills to save life a fellow trekker. This is unfortunate accident to have at that altitude. Great inputs from Carolin, John and Kirked... I agree.At 3 PM, the trekking in Nepal Himalayas to that altitude; I would imagine you had already trekked/walked 2/3rd of your time/distance and still have rest to complete i.e. last one third of the day is always challenging to higher altitudes. At the very same time, you have chosen to go to Thorang Phedi instead of moving down (i.e. you were in upper setment). Hence, you all must have been tired and gaining more altitudes over the days.Then about 'what you should have done' in your last segment is always there. On top of that, you are not a practicing physician (Emergency). Even if we are, there will be always room for the 'best decision at the moment with available resources'. Hence, you have done great with such an effort. Thank you for the detailed account here and it is classic traumatic brain injury - all history you have given. I am very happy that the person survived.I assume you had crossed the river and were walking along the side of right while going up. There are all loose rocks and soil ....which seem constantly moving. It makes even worse as Yaks do graze higher up, mountain goats roam around and sometimes snow leopards hunt those mountain goats high up making them to run and rush....they all aggravate movement of rocks and soil in that long steep side. It is dangerous area to pass through.In 2008, I was in Thorang Phedi (making it a satellite clinic) for about three weeks while I was working at HRA Manang Aid Post. I can understand the difficulty, the challenge and frustration you got during all these rescue operations. It is really difficult due to altitude, terrain, temperature and lacking communication means! Yes, I do aggree with you about removing obvious foreign bodies (which are on the surface) from the wound. Yes, you are right about cleaning with betadine (diluting with boiled water when you reached Phedi). While at the very time, you might have been fine because not doing so, you mobilized wound less especially when there was depressed skull fractures (large and open!). What could have been better if it was cleaned, you could apply clean and betadine gauge to stop bleeding and not to change that ofen (unless it bleeds more and soaks gauge completely). Great job Jon...massive humanitarian work! I can understand the frantic search for medication and burrowing medication (with German script). Glad that you found some. Yes, that's important to alleviate pain and at the very same time if there were some NSAIDS - cyclooxygenase inhibitors (which are available even over the counter e.g. Ibuprofen) and used in high altitude headaches; that might be helpful as well. Indomethacin (another NSAIDs) of this group reduces cerebral blood flow .... acute brain swelling with altitude hypoxia (AMS pathology) is thought to happen and Indomethacin is also used to in raised intracranial pressures....the drug easily available and used quite extensively ...likely to be found around as well. I am putting here as a discussion if available ...Vomiting episodes that we would not have wished for...luckily it did not get worse. I am thinking it did happen because of physical reasons (i.e. steep terrain, loose rocks and soil, narrow trail, fatigue...) rather than any altitude illness. Trekkers who go Annupurna circuit slowly gain altitude by its nature of terrain although that starts rise quickly from Yak Kharka...last a couple of days! The treks from Yak Kharka-Thorang Phedi and Phedi-onwards....I think trekkeers should start early (around 8-9 AM) in the morning. The late it gets, difficult it becomes...wind, cold and then there is altitude gain. Hence, one gets pressed which is not get...as you can't take enough breaks! The segment on the right side up after crossing river to Thorang Phedi is difficult due to all those topography. One should really carefully pass through.I hope the person is doing better....Once again, great work and thank you for sharing.....Wishes,mati	Matiram Pun	19/1/2013 1:27 AM	0	0

You deserve a pat on your back.  Just one clarification: do helmets are an essential part of the montenering kit? And can one have it worn during high altitude climbing where hypoxic conditions exist. Do they come in the delivery of oxygen supply circuits that are connected to the individuals while climbing high altitudes? Or, any modifications in helmets can be devised to minimize accidental head trauma as happened in this case?-z7q6tr3791	csm@csm	10/3/2013 5:50 PM	0	0

Have you tried zooming into that original? It's likedivingdown on Google Earth, but in more detail. JohnPosted by John DAgreed respected John! But here is an important tip from the basic physics- How to look at the photographs' Every photograph is, however black and white it may be, is 3-D in nature. But our human eyes being stereoscopic, are not able to see the inbuilt depth, the third dimension in it. The reason why the birds can fly with ease is that they lack the stereoscopic vision and have 'monoscopic' vision. If the birds would have a stereoscopic vision, they might not be able to fly, due to perception of the depth. To unmask the hidden depth or the third dimension in the photographs (actually 3D images), simply close one eye, so that the apparent two dimensional image would then appear a 3-D image! Look at the upscaled image by me with one eye closed and you will be aware of the depth, the third dimension and the beauty.-pz2axbaak	Dr. K. Ashutosh	23/12/2012 2:38 PM	0	0

1184	258	1	"The bar-headed geese have been enigmatic for the physiologists and biologists as they fly over Himalayas where there is barely minimal oxygen to sustain life for the human beings. Sometime ago, The Jouranal of Applied Physiology had this topic in the debate called 'Point-Counterpoint""Poing: http://jap.physiology.org/content/111/5/1514Counterpoint: http://jap.physiology.org/content/111/5/1515.fullDebate Comments: http://jap.physiology.org/content/111/5/1520.full?sid=b5652b82-76c6-4d73-9598-5d1b52f7f322Last word in the Debate: http://jap.physiology.org/content/111/5/1525.full?sid=b5652b82-76c6-4d73-9598-5d1b52f7f322The recent findings have come out the birds' efficiency and breaks they take despite previous notions that they fly high and continuous!http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/10/25/rspb.2012.2114.longThe abstract:============================Abstract Bar-headed geese are renowned for  migratory flights at extremely high altitudes over the world's tallest  mountains, the Himalayas,                      where partial pressure of oxygen is dramatically  reduced while flight costs, in terms of rate of oxygen consumption, are  greatly                      increased. Such a mismatch is paradoxical, and it  is not clear why geese might fly higher than is absolutely necessary. In                      addition, direct empirical measurements of  high-altitude flight are lacking. We test whether migrating bar-headed  geese actually                      minimize flight altitude and make use of favourable  winds to reduce flight costs. By tracking 91 geese, we show that these                      birds typically travel through the valleys of the  Himalayas and not over the summits. We report maximum flight altitudes  of                      7290 m and 6540 m for southbound and northbound  geese, respectively, but with 95 per cent of locations received from  less                      than 5489 m. Geese travelled along a route that was  112 km longer than the great circle (shortest distance) route, with  transit                      ground speeds suggesting that they rarely profited  from tailwinds. Bar-headed geese from these eastern populations  generally                      travel only as high as the terrain beneath them  dictates and rarely in profitable winds. Nevertheless, their migration  represents                      an enormous challenge in conditions where humans  and other mammals are only able to operate at levels well below their  sea-level                      maxima.                   ============================I believe this as I have seen these geese taking breaks in inner valleys of Nepal!"

1197	262	1	"You canwatch this debate again here(go to F1: The big debate)   Here is a summary of the arguments:  For     A patient quote: ""I am the only one is consistently there. I am the only one who knows the whole story.""    JS Mill quote: ""Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.""    The responsibility of making all the decisions and the liability for the outcomes of those decisions is worrying for doctors.    This is about competent patients.    If you agree with your rights as an individual you will agree with this motion.    Through initiatives like open access and Patients Included patients can now work with a lot of the same information/data that researchers and specialists do.    The patient as a network of care givers and other advocates in the community is in a better position than one doctor ever could be.    To keep on top of all the primary care literature a GP would have to spend 18 hours a day reading.    A doctor sees a patient for 1-2 hours a year. The patients and care givers self care for the other 8764 hours.    Patients are the ones who know how to live well with their diseases; they are able to prioritise the outcomes that matter to them; they are the ones who know how to make decisions in time frames appropriate to them.    The imbalance between doctor and patient is changing.    Co-production is an opportunity to work with patients in order to develop things in a new way.    From patients we can learn about things that clinicians never reailsed were important.    Biomed central has just produced the first journal based entirely around co-production with professional and patient coordinators.    Don't think of patients as a burden, think of them as a resource we need to harness.    It is the ageing population and people with diabetes, cancer, mental health that come to mind when thinking about this motion.    Doctors do not just provide healthcare, they manage healthcare which is a long term process where the patient can be brought in to know best.    Well informed patients with capacity who are stakeholders of their own health would not make decisions that would impact negatively.    Richard smith, ex-editor ofThe BMJ,is chairman of Patients Know Best.    Why not recruit patients onto your team? By empowering them you can work together for better results that cannot be achieved alone.    Self care is already part of many plans - eg diabetes. Why not increase this?   Against     No one person knows best, it is about balance.    Patients know ""different"" but not ""best"".    The current power and knowledge imbalance prevents patients from knowing best.    Patients seek listening, understanding, and caring, not a win-lose ""I know best.""    There is no published literature saying the patient view is the singular correct one.    Being informed is not the same as being responsible; patients and families should not be in the position of being entirely responsible for their care. Shared decision making is the better way.    Don Berwick's ""My right knee"" speech is about the impact of recurrent patellar dislocation, multiple cartilage tears/repairs, and subsequent osteoarthritis on his trekking, his playing with his children, and his keeping fit.    Patients know what is important to them but may not know everything.    Science in medicine is complex. Think Dr House - the wonderful brain that instantly recognises the 24 causes of erythema nodosum, or the rare complication of the over the counter cold remedy that leads to brain inflammation and death. We can't expect every patient to have this level or range of knowledge. If we did. we wouldn't be necessary.    This is not limited to medicine. Do you really understand the heating engineer when he tells you that you need a new boiler?    When patients are ill they want relationships with their doctors.    Doctors know more about the side effects of drugs than patients; patients know more about which side effects they don't want. Eg a swimmer doesn't want weight gain    If rushed to hospital in an ambulance, ""Don't ask me what's best, just save my bloody life.""    In general, patients are excluded from knowing everything.    Patients don't want to know what is best, they want to work with doctors for what is best.    Identifying anyone as knowing best is counterproductive to working as a team.    Giving too much power to one person sets up rivalry.    Look at the example of Ashya King. Irrespective of which side you think is right, there should have been a push to harmonising the views between healthcare professionals and the patient/parents to look at all perspectives/scenarios and calculate what was best for the patient.    Don't vilify one side for not knowing best.    The external social factors that patients bring are important but they are not the only matter of importance.    Currently there is miscommunication and patients have a lack of working knowledge of systems so healthcare opinion is necessary.-gf4k2a27sia65bk4biz"	Sabreena	29/4/2015 3:19 PM	1	0

1199	262	1	Sabreena   I have to admit Im another one who thinks there are a few curious aspects to this question and indeed the international forum that debated it.   In the way its asked the question is surely unanswerable. The words angels, dancing and heads of pins come to mind. I can see that the question might be one for a student debate but does it really justify the time and expense of an international event which doesnt seem likely to lead to anything tangible.   I cant help wondering if theres a hidden hand behind all this. These conferences cost a great deal of money and I just wonder where it comes from. The Institute for Healthcare Improvements website is a little vague on its sources of funding. Could all that money not be betterspent onother things? If the answer to the ill-defined question was yes I suppose, however,it could have dramatic implications (in either direction) for funding the Health Service!

1200	262	1	Sorry to appear cynical but this debate by the International Forum seems a bit pointless to me and probably a waste of money.Does the patient know best? Almost certainly not, hence they consult a Doctor. Would it not be essentially obvious that the Doctor and patient cooperate together to try and do what is best for the patient. A patient might be thoroughly unrealistic about treatment, its chances of success or what they believe treatment should be. The Doctor is the expert in medicine and the patient the expert about themself - together they have the best chance of overcoming whatever health problem they face.   kirked-9qq2c7dt	kirked	1/5/2015 6:58 PM	0	0
1201	262	1	Sabreena   This might just reflect my lack of skill, but I couldn't access thisdebate without having to commit a worrying amount of time watching the forum in general.Could you please tell usthe result of the debate? You've seen the results of the poll, albeit with a fairly small sample, and I wonder how this compared with the debate itself. I wonder also about your own thoughts on the question itself and what it actually means.   I suppose it's no accident that the wording is aligned with the name ofparticular organisation linked to a previous BMJ editor. Whilst there's no inherent problem with this, the forumwas a vast event with the backing of some very large corporations and there must surely be a larger agenda than simplyto debate such a gnomic question.   Given the scale of the event and its potential ramifications, are we going to see it fully reported by the BMJ (its co-sponsor) or does it remain restricted to the blogosphere?-63y5dayz1k5g6b0c2	Maxim	2/5/2015 7:10 PM	0	0
1202	262	1	"Hello all  Pre-debate audience vote: ""For"" won with ~60% of votes.  Post-debate audience vote: ""Against"" won. They didn't mention the ratio but from the screenshot of the audience I would say it was 70-80%.  Obviously the word ""best"" was contentious and was the core of many of the against speakers' opinions but would a less provocative motion have stimulated as much discussion at the Forum and away from it? For anyone who was there/watched the video it seems clear that the outcome of the debate was less about which side won and more about both sides insistence that better collaborative doctor-patient relationships are required.-i7qx67235"	Sabreena	6/5/2015 10:43 AM	0	0
1203	262	1	Sabreena   Many thanks for that information. It wasn't the word 'best' that I found odd, more the completely undefinednature of the question. The swing from 60% for the motion pre-debateto, possibly, 70-80% against post debate mightbe something of a debatingrecord.Shame that so many people had to travel expensivelyacross the world to find they agreed with each other about the need forbettercollaboration butperhaps 60%hadn'trealised that before.-10l0exa9b7b0aha5c3dgrl	Maxim	6/5/2015 8:07 PM	0	0
1204	262	1	I chaired this very well-attended session at the Forum. It is in the nature of a formal debate that the terms of the argument are put starkly. This facilitates rapid exploration of the issues, in order to help the listeners reflect on their own attitudes/prejudices. In fact the feedback from the audience was very positive, and the swing was genuinely marked. For the first time this year, the Forum had recruited a patient panel to help us frame the agenda and ensure proper patient representation. Again this was well-received, and patient inclusion will only deepen in future.  As for IHI: it is a not-for-profit that does superlative work, improving healthcare in many different countries. It reaches millions of professionals, and its model is that the fees it receives from health systems in the developed world, pay for the work it does in low-income countries. Many of its resources, such as its Open School, are completely free. The Forum, now in its 20th year, does not cost IHI anything. There is no 'hidden hand', whatever that is supposed to mean; most of the delegates pay to attend, and the costs are also met by the sponsors, all of whom are publicly acknowledged, and the most generous of which is the Health Foundation.

1211	267	1	"Whenever I looked into medicines, I used to read the name of pharmaceutical, the manufactured date and expiry date printed on the Drug foil just to make sure I buy the safest and genuine Medicine. I always thought the drug becomes poisonous the very next month after its expiry date(month to be precise, as is mentioned) so, I was utmost careful before buying one.   Im into Final year of Medical School but I still havent figured out why that people and even I are so is worried when it comes to Date-expired drugs. Sounds a bit weird but you need logic to support or refute any claim. So I thought of doing some research into it.      So is it a Marketing strategy or a genuine health-related call, do the Pharmaceuticals want round-the-clock and round-the-year money or do they really care about Health of Patients?      The Expiry date mentioned on a drug means the Pharmaceutical Company gives a guarantee of the full potency and safety of the drug, it does not mean how long the drug is actually ""good"" or safe to use. This is based on a law that began in 1979 in United States.   Theoretically what I Know is Drugs like Tetracycline when used after expired date cause Renal Tubular Damage because of degraded products (Epitetracycline etc.) and liquid preparations are usually unstable if kept for long. Other drugs like Nitroglycerin and Insulin are also found to be unsafe but not the case with majority of other drugs.     Even though not much of data are available in this, one is:  A study conducted by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requested by the military occurred due to the fact that the military faces tossing out and replacing a large expensive pile of drugs every few years(approximating $1 Billion). The study found that 90% of more than 100 different prescription and non-prescription drugs were still safe and effective to use even 15 years after the date of expiration.   That however doesnt mean drugs are safe even after expiry date. There is a lack of evidence/study/trials regarding efficacy of expired-drugs..   Always store drug in a cool, dark and dry place and lets wait for a unbiased study results to this issue.   Expecting some inputs...-9s1d5g8xr47416csba99hh"	Samirjha	3/4/2015 7:00 AM	2	0
1212	267	1	Every anaesthetist 'knows' that suxamethonium, the short acting muscle relaxant for rapid intubation, must be kept in the fridge.   If an ampoule was left out on the bench for as much as a list, I would say - throw it away!  Then, at the Olympics, we were given a drug pack, just a plastic box, that included sux, together with documentation to reassure us that sux at room temperature was good for three months!   I think you may have a good case, Samirjha, for a reassessment of drug expiry times.   John-jmnb7	John D	3/4/2015 9:35 AM	2	0
1213	267	1	A very relevant problem , but so much depends on which drug. There is some ongoing reassessment of lifespan of (I think ) ciprofloxacin. So far seems OK even some years after expiry date. The problem with antibiotics is that in many respects it is the drug activity not clinical effect that is being marketed , so a decay of 10% may not be clinicaly relevant but could be in terms of license agreement etc... Put another way , I have been quite happy to swallow some quite outdated tablets but would be hesitant about giving them to patients. The cynic might say , most of them will either not be taken or not needed but that is a separate issue. I have also worked on the basis that many of the tablets I am likely to swallow are for effect (eg analgaesia) and have not noticed any loss of efficacy. Ppi have a problem with storage , but are now sold mostly in blister packs. I am a bit wary with time expired drugs if they disintegrate when exposed to the light of day....   The big worry is always about storage - antibiotics used for travel may be faced with shortish periods of very cold conditions (plane flight) followed by a few weeks in a hot environment - but common sense over storage in the UK should not be a problem. Perhaps not dissimilar to wine - just recently we opened a bottle of very good white from our cellar and it had clearly gone off .t. Yet last year I had given a bottle to someone who is very fussy about wine and he thought it brilliant. When drugs /wine go off they can go off quite quickly? And of course the rules for one wine may not apply to others.   I think the tetracycline problem wa largely related to the very old capsule formulation not the tetracyline itself - is there any evidence that it still applies ?   Practically , as with tinned and packaged foods , there will always be commercial pressures to have an expiry date , both in terms of testing efficacy (just how much would it cost to explore decay over a period of , say, 15 years ) and in sales. Medically , we really need to know about adequate storage but also discourage old drugs lyin around. As a child (pre-NHS) I remember the GP giving the OK for my father who was sick with a chest infection to take the sulphonamides we had kept in the cupboard for our dog.   The real tragedy is that some of those in the third world feel there is disrespect in being given tablets just passed their official shelf life - better to go without than be dissed...	sken	3/4/2015 12:25 PM	2	0

1218	268	1	Many of you would be aware of the   Plan   Do   Study   Act   method which is used in healthcare improvement. Some or many of you would have even used the method yourself.   I find that in UK healthcare that there are many problems in the way we use the PDSA. Many who use the PDSA seem not to know what comes before and what comes after their PDSA efforts. I also suspect that many senior persons also do not either know or care about this issue.   That is the issue I discuss in my latest blog  http://successinhealthcare.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/the-problem-with-pdsa-in-healthcare.html   What is your experience of PDSA? Could you share it here?

In healthcare, I'd never heard of this, and after recovering from my confusion with the Vetinarary and on reading your post, Hemadri, I then assumed that this was a new model for history, examination, differential diagnosis, investigation and treatment. But NO!  It's for introducing new procedures and processes in the delivery of healthcare.

1224	269	1	Very interesting . I wonder how many doctors implement the suggestions already - I think it has been around for some time? Some of the relatively relaxed atmosphere may stem subconsciously from the doctor anyway once the caecum has been reached. Colonoscopy certainly could be a pretty brutish procedure , but hopefully now that doctors are trained and instruments so much improved this applies much less. ( I remember comment about 1 doctor - you could tell when he had a list as the screams could be heard outside the hospital.... ). . Personally I felt one of he low points of medical care was when we were encouraged to use midazolam freely - and then to reverse it - on the grounds that the patient would have poor recall for distress. Good advice for some torturers perhaps but less than ideal for health care professionals. It is a pity that carefully titrated analgaesia is now frowned upon.-i4	sken	21/2/2014 2:04 PM	0	0

1228	271	1	Of course, the doctor should respect the wishes of the patient. Make a record of this in her/his notes.

It seems very good that the patient has trust in the doctor as usual and the patient will accept the treatment offered.-lq	Basha63002	24/5/2014 9:54 PM	0	0
1229	271	1	To a greater or lesser extent this is a common occurrence but it's a mistake tothink that there's alwaysa one-off answer that will serve the whole duration of the doctor patient relationship.   Of, course, the 'right' answer is always to respect the patient's wishes but we might need to understand the patient's wishes more fully to be able to give the sort of respect that helps the patient withwhat they want and need.   In the course of making it clear that we intend, as far as possible, to comply with the patient's wishes it's perfectly reasonable to ask diplomaticallyabout possible reasons forthese wishes and, in particular, whether the patient has any strong suspicions of the diagnosis and what might happen. Fear about serious disease might underlie the wish not to have information but if serious disease is then found it will presumably become clear in due course. Sometimes the wish not to know can be because the knowing can have certain time-limited consequences such as insurance or travel plans.   Given that this sort of discussion arises where there are likely to be several meetings it's also OK to revisit those wishes carefullyat subsequent meetings and not to assume that the wishes will never change.Even where the patient's initial views seem firm they might still appreciate adiscussion of the ways in which their preferred care is likely to be better if there can be sharing of information andoptions.   Perhaps the one absolute is not to be persuaded, without the patient's permission, togive assertive relativesthe information that the patient has not received.-wy5bza70alg0a2j7g7ktca2f2fi2gy	Maxim	25/5/2014 10:32 AM	0	0

1232	271	1	Thank you for the comments. My only concern was that if patients don't actually have all the information can they then make the decision to allow the doctor to make all decisions? But as you mentioned Maxim, it would probably be good to revisit the patient's wishes and emphasise that discussing options and sharing information may help them make a more informed decision about their care.	Arousa	25/5/2014 1:12 PM	0	0
1233	271	1	Arousa   You makethe very good point that the criteria for capacityinclude the abilies to understand, remember andappreciate the implications of decisions andof information. Here there might seem to be a dilemma in that the patientis deciding not to be told some ofthe information to be understood, remembered and used.   Myresponse would be thatthe patient wouldneed toappreciate thatthose criteria alsoapply to the potential consequencesof not having information. Ironically,the patient might wellknowsome of those consequences better than does the doctor. For both parties, however, there will be many unknowns anduncertainties and that alsoneeds to beaccepted and appreciatedby the patient.   As Basha has pointed out, it is so important to document these discussions and decisions, not just as legal precaution, but as a basis for revisiting the discussion at each visit.-l6w6b7b5bp2d8a6cdcwrhpt9a0amwe9c5c1aly	Maxim	25/5/2014 3:04 PM	0	0
1234	271	1	Well I too believe that we need to respect every patient's sentiments, it is the prime most duty of the Doctor to keep a note in writing, at the same time acknowledging the actual condition of the patient to his near & dear ones.	CAUrgentCare	26/5/2014 6:07 AM	0	0
1235	271	1	"Unfortunately this is a question where there is no satisfactory answer. We assume that one of our duties is to impart information - perhaps something to do with a pretence of being in control. The problem becomes very relevant when trying to obtain informed consent but even more so when the prognosis is very poor. Looking after someone who does not want to know that life is likely to be very limited can be challenging - not least because initial unwillingness to hear may not be their real feeling.. For some it may be a coping mechanism but for others it seems that an understanding of probabilities is beyond their grasp. So how does one explain stopping pointless therapies etc ... ? For some too it seems their knowledge of a very limited lifespan simply puts an impossible burden on the remaining weeks or months. It is a bit late when the patient says ""I wish you had not told me that"" .   The answer by urgentcare is all well and good - except that sometimes patients specifically state that they do not wish their nearest and dearest to know if the news is bad - now that really must be entered in the notes."	sken	27/5/2014 9:14 PM	0	0

1238	274	1	If you look at all the media headlines and numbers being thrown around you would be justfied in thiniking that there was so many needless or avoidable deaths that if all of them were prevented UK could become immortal.   So I quickly added up the media numbers and found 254k lives could be saved that means if we got it right we will be 60% on our way to immortality. Any takers?   This of course is different from another measure called 'mortality amenable to healthcare' which gives us a more realistic or plausible idea,   A few more words on my blog http://successinhealthcare.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/in-search-of-immortality.html	Hemadri	26/9/2013 11:57 AM	0	0

1240	274	1	We need to know that we are not mistake proof. And mistakes can lead to fatal outcomes.   Therefore we need to do everything possible to minimise the chances for such mistakes by various means.   And there are cases when imminent death is unavoidable. There we have a communication problem. We need not be afraid to talk to families and need not to appear as if we hold some kind of secret/s. So, being open and at the same time sympathetic will not hurt our ego, but will bring us more points for the hard work we do to save patients every day.-4r	yoram chaiter	26/9/2013 7:36 PM	0	0

1243	276	1	I would like to ask you for your opinion:   I had a patient with colon tumor (carcinoma) invading into urinary bladder (54years, PMH: B lymphoma with chemotherapy - compete remission, ASA 2, NYHA II, no severe sepsis). Patient was admitted into hospital day before surgery. Canulation of jugular vein was done (as part of preparation before surgery) resulted in large pneumothorax, which was drained by chest drain followed by reexpansion of the lung.   I would like to know your opinion:   1) in case of pneumothorax - do you postpone general anaesthesia/surgery for elective surgery and for how long?   2) in case of pneumothorax - do you postopone general anaesthesia/surgery forcarcinoma and for how long?

1245	276	1	"A) There are many unknowns in medicine / anaesthesia. I am persuated that this is example when the ""evidence"" in the literature can be based on expert opinion and not on proper evidence based medicine. I was very interested in expert opinion. I expected more answers but thank you a lot for this one.    B)Another expert opinion: I communicated by email with "" a prominent anaesthetist"" from Stanford University, US, his answer was:   1) in case of pneumothorax - do you postpone general anaesthesia/surgery for carcinoma and for how long? Answer: Ifthere is a chest tubein place, there is no risk for general anesthesia on a patient with a chest tube. We do it frequently in take back cases following open heart or open chest surgery. If the surgeon was willing, you could do the surgery the same day, providing there was no bleeding and no vital sign instability.   2) in case of pneumothorax - do you postopone general anaesthesia/surgery if tumor is benign and for how long? Answer: Same as for 1), except that for a benign tumor there is no urgency, and the surgical team may well delay until the patient has no chest tube and is again in excellent condition.   C) OK, but it resulted in my other two questions:   3) in case that pneumothorax is small and not drained: do you postpone general anaesthesia/surgeryfor elective surgeryand for how long? If you decide to do surgery - do you insert chest drain before surgery?   4) in case that pneumothorax is small and not drained: do you postopone general anaesthesia/surgeryfor carcinomaand for how long?

1246	276	1	Jeremy,   Thank you for your patience!   I'm a (retired) anaesthetist. I agree partly with the above, and probably wholly if we were able to talk abouit it around the coffee cups.   In the scenario you give, I would as Silverfox says be concnered that the conditions of anaesthesia would make a pneumothorax worse, even tension if the drain was inadeqaute in the face of nitrous oxide if you must use that outdated agent and the positive pressure ventilation that major abdominal surgery will require.  After all, my misplaced CVP needle has probably damaged lung tissue, so that gas and blood will continue to escape   I would discuss the relative risk with the surgeon.  Would one or two days delay impose no significant risk to curing the patient?  Could the surgeon reschedule the case in a reasonable time?  If the answer was yes to both then postpone the operation, and of course take time to explain to the patient as soon as possible. For how long?  That is more difficult to say.   At least until a day after the drain has been removed, and a check CXR has confirmed no residual air.   If not, then position a formal chest drain (not just an apical stab), ensure that the drainage can be observed continuously, and monitor chest sounds.  I think I might recruit a colleague (who is an expert)to advise on the use of ultrasound to monitor frequently the state of the pneumothorax.   I would use a technique that excludes nitrous oxide, and use the same technique and monitoring when a postponed patient came to theatre.

1247	276	1	"Jeremy - Many thanks for this thread. I fequently looked to see opinions , knowing we have at least one anaesthetist among our doc2doc regulars. The eventual answers were as expected. I recall the way pneumonectomy was carried out years ago and the most junior doctor just re-adjusted pressures as necessary on the wards. A very simple procedure ... Well , there was the occasion when a colleague re-adjusted them on the wrong side(ie gave the patient a pneumothorax on the good side as well) . The nurse recognised what had happened very quickly and I happened to be around . Speedy action and no real harm done , no complaint , no ""clinical incident"" , no repercussions etc... How times have changed ? My message from this anecdote is that the patient might need to be monitored on a ward with at least a nodding acquaintance with chest drains, Has anyone done an audit of chest drains in a DGH to see how many are still working?   I have a very distinct impression that a number of surgeons , particularly older ones, at times wish to find an excuse for not operating.   There are too many imponderables - relative need for surgery , etc... as John D has pointed out. Overall lung function is perhaps just as important- there are folk where the pneumothorax is chronic.   And of course , as an oldie I wondered just why he was having jugular vein cannulation as a routine I remember one unit where this was done routinely on all those queried a sG-I bleeds - primarily for training purposes - as opposed to those where the bleed was thought significant. The widespread use of Swan-Ganz catheters perhaps had a similar basis. As an outside assessor of a life threatening complication of rigid sigmoidoscopy by a junior doctor I commented that , for the patient in question , I could not see a need for the procedure in the first place.. The rejoinder was that all patients needed it to confirm whether or not constipation was present. ...-9h5c62"	sken	7/1/2016 10:28 AM	0	0

Some examples from my own experience or those I know about - effect of drop in blood pressure (not necessarily an absolute drop but one related to individual) , post operative renal problems , possible exacerbation of poor cerebral functioning in the elderly , symptoms associated with spinal cord damage after spinal etc.... None of these would necessarily be relayed back to the anaesthetists concerned who may blithely conclude all is well.   Years ago as an acute physician we ised to admit a number of post -operative surgical problems but the surgeon running the surgical audit did not want to know with a singularly unhelpful response along the lines of what about the problems caused by the physicians.-fn"	sken	16/10/2015 1:51 PM	0	0

My earlier comment was that because we now assume the anaesthetic risks and complications are minimal (""patients are at their safest when anaesthetised"") and we really need better data about what are the longer term effects - it should be quite possible to do a large scale audit of the CEPOD type but geared towards the anaesthetic.

John       Posted by John D   John,   As a bit of information Here is an Abstract:      Abstract   Safe and effective anesthesia of dogs and cats relies on preanesthetic patient assessment and preparation. Patients should be premedicated with drugs that provide sedation and analgesia prior to anesthetic induction with drugs that allow endotracheal intubation. Maintenance is typically with a volatile anesthetic such as isoflurane or sevoflurane delivered via an endotracheal tube. In addition, local anesthetic nerve blocks; epidural administration of opioids; and constant-rate infusions of lidocaine, ketamine, and opioids are useful to enhance analgesia. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous system functions are continuously monitored so that anesthetic depth can be modified as needed. Emergency drugs and equipment, as well as an action plan for their use, should be available throughout the perianesthetic period. Additionally, intravenous access and crystalloid or colloids are administered to maintain circulating blood volume. Someone trained in the detection of recovery abnormalities should monitor patients throughout recovery. Postoperatively, attention is given to body temperature, level of sedation, and appropriate analgesia. (J Am Anim Hosp Assoc 2011; 47:377385. DOI 10.5326/JAAHA-MS-5846)   Ketamine, Isoflourane, and sevoflourane are used a good amount in veterinary practice in the USA.

1263	281	1	The correct answer isHypercapnia     Explanation:  One of the most important factors that regulate cerebral vascular tone is PaCO2. Carbon dioxide induces cerebral vasodilatation and therefore increases CBF. There is a linear increase between a PaCO2between 20 mmHg (2.7 kPa) and 80 mmHg (8.6 kPa).  There are likely to be areas where autoregulation may have failed locally but not globally. Similarly local versus systemic acidosis will have similar effects. The CBF does not significantly change until the PaO2falls below 50 mmHg (6.5 kPa) below which the CBF progressively increases.  Hyperthermia causes an increase in the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) and therefore CBF. (CMRO2and CBF are linked). Hyperthermia secondary to hypothalamic injury can be a late feature of cerebral injury and is therefore not the most likely cause of an increased CBF in this scenario.

1264	282	1	Anaesthesia is all about anticipating problems and overcoming them.  One that is at the front of every anaesthetist's mind is the airway, and today that task has been made much easier by the several Supra-Glottic Airway (SGA) devices that are available.   To anticipate any problems, there are clinical scoring systems, that can indicate potentially difficult airways and intubations, but this case totally slipped by them.   The patient was to have procedure for which an SGA was appropriate, and scored normally on all indicators of airway difficulty.   But an i-gel SGA could not be positioned, nor could a Laryngeal Mask Airway (for non-anaesthetists, SGAs are normally passed blind).  So we had a look into the patient's pharynx, and this is what we saw.        Lower picture shows the laryngosope being used a tongue depressor; the upper was the ebst view that could be obtained of the larynx.   What would you do next?

1271	282	1	"You woudn't have been insulting this discipline!   But back to the problem, which was that the anatomy of this patient's pharynx would not allow a supraglottic airway to be positioned, and obscured the larynx on direct larygoscopy, so that intubation was difficult/impossible.  Solutions would include:   Abandon the procedure.  Maintain the airway by hand, and allow the patient to awake.  This is the safest by far and should be considered before any other.   Proceed using oral (Guedel) or nasal airways.  Possible, even with a full stomach, if cricoid pressure can be maintained and the urgency justifies.   Use a modified laryngoscope blade that allows you to 'see around the corner'. EG the ""Airtraq"" disposable with a system of mirrors or the re-usable McCoy blade with a liftable tip.   Use videolaryngoscopy.  Technology has now advanced tio the point where a laryngoscope blade can have high resolution camera built into the tip.  The image may be shown on a screen attached to the 'scope (EG McGrath), or be separately mounted (Glidescope).   My department had elected to buy a Glidescope, and with its aid I had a clear viw of the vocal cords and was able to pass an endotracheal tube, shaped by a wire bougie, quickly and with ease.

That is heavily contaminated with by-products due to the crude means of production and the result of poor care of the merchandise leading to degradation.   In the UK, street heroin contains only about 50% of the pure substance, with much of the rest paracetamol!  Another white powder, you see.

Ready? ""Levator palpebrae superioris alaeque nasi""  The lifter of the upper lip and 'wing of the nose', the nostril.    He gave me an injection of local anaesthetic (thank goodness) which was entirely painless (I wish I could give LAs as painlessly!) for work on an upper bicuspid tooth.   Afterwards, when I had thanked him and left, I realised - I can't sniff down that nostril!  When I do so (and I'm suffering with my Hay Fever) instead of the muscle tensing and keeping it open, the nostril collapses and closes the orifice!  The importance of such tiny muscles is rarely seen.   And it reminds me of long ago, when I was one of a group of medical students who drove a van to Greece for a summer holiday. No, not that 'Summer Holiday'. We visited the Theatre of Epidaurus, and wishing to test the famous acoustics, I went down to the centre of the stage while my friends stayed on the upper tier.

1286	287	1	Emergency and difficult tracheal intubations are hazardous undertakings where successive laryngoscopyhypoxaemiare-oxygenation cycles can escalate to airway loss and the can't intubate, can't ventilate scenario.   New research, published in Anaesthesia shows that 'pre-post-oxygenation', achieved using the Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) technique, can increase the safe apnoeic window for 25 patients with difficult/impossible airways to a median of 14 minutes (range 5 - 65 minutes).    These findings, if replicated in larger studies, have the potential to transform the nature of difficult intubations from a hurried and stressful 'stop-start' process, limited by rapid desaturations and re-oxygenations, to a smooth and unhurried undertaking.

1287	287	1	"rezanouraei,   Welcome to Doc2DOc! And thank you for linking to such an interesting article! To anaesthetists, anyway.   I have to say that even with careful pre-op assessment and the use of the several scoring systems for difficult intubation, anesthetists may still be caught out by an unexpectedly difficult intubation.  This should always be managed by strict application of a Failed Intubation Drill, whose principles are:   1/ Realisation and acceptance that this patient cannot be intubated by the method initially chosen, usually direct laryngoscopy under IV anaesthesia and paralysis. This is not so easy, especially to the relatively inexperienced, which does not include the authors of this paper.   A rule that I teach trainees, and was taught me by the Ambulance service, was to take a deep breath when I stopped ventilating the patient to attempt intubation. When I want to breath, so does the patient!   2/ At this point, all attempts at intubation should cease, and the manual bag and mask ventilation recommenced. If necessary, full stomach, pregnancy, the patient should be turned to the lateral position, to ease airway maintenance and the draining of secretions or aspirate.   3/ While manual ventilation continues, further management may safely be considered, the recruitment of assitance and if appropriate senior help, the use of other aids to intubation, and the absolute need for intubation or indeed for general anaesthesia for this case.   But that is a protocol for dealing with the unexpected.  All of the 25 patients in this study were expected, or known to have ""difficult airways"", but none were ""can't intubate, can't ventilate"" (CICV) .  Apnoeic Oxygenation, keeping the oxygen tension in the airway high after preoxygenation so that diffusion alone, without ventilation, forces oxygen down the airway, into the alveolae and into the blood and tissues has been well-known since the days of rigid bronchoscopy.  It is therefore a trivial observation that an open, albeit with difficulty, airway keeps the blood oxygen tension high if the pharynx is filled with pure oxygen, even if the patient is apnoeic. But it only works if the airway is open, so that it would be useless in a CICV case.   Far, far more important is to anticipate the difficult intubation, and to avoid general anaesthesia or intubation if possible. If that is not possible, then to have to hand one of the many modern aids to intubation, from a miniature TV camera-equipped laryngoscope blade to a fibre-optic laryngoscope to be used with topical anaesthesia by awake intubation.   I sincerely hope that this paper will not cause the inexperienced or foolhardy to mess about with nasal cannulae, but to do what every aanesthetist should do, to keep their patient as far as possible from unnecessary risk.

1295	288	1	All the anaesthetic vapours have a distinct odour, and while nitrous oxide is odourless, it's MAC - Minimum Anaesthetic (or Alveolar)Concentration - is over 100%! Which means that it is hard to incapacitate someone with N2O alone. Used to done, but by partioaly asphyxiating the poor patient. Tere have been stories since the 19th Century of burglars and others subding people with chloroform, but that would need a soaked pad held to the face, and while Chloroform is quite potent, they victim would need to be bound and gagged, or kept under with the chloroform.   An anaesthetic that could subdue someone who neither cooperates nor knows that they are being subdued is a long sought target by security services. Whena Chechen seperatistsheld hostagea Moscow theatre full of people in 2002, the Russians pumped a nebulised form of fentanyl into the air conditioning system. It was unsuccesful in subduing the terrorists, but zapped many the hostages. In the ensuing gun battle most of the terrorist were killed. Of the 850 hostages, 130 died, only one from gunshot wounds, the rest narcotised to death, largely because the Russian authorities did not tell the many doctors and paramedcs standing by that they had used a narcotic. Simple antagonists like naloxone could have saved many, who were thought to have had infarcts or other problems. Many probably asphysiated from loss of airway becoming unconcious sitting in a theatre seat.   No, I don't think that there is any 'gas', available to a lorry robber, that could temporarily incapacitate the driver without high risk of permanent injury.

1301	290	1	This opinion was emailed to me by Dr Innes from Australia         Mr Darryl Elliot was convicted for the murder of Amelia Bowmar on the evidence of doctors who alleged Amelia was Shaken to death. The basis of this allegation was the presence of a subdural haematoma, swelling of the brain with ischaemic changes and haemorrhagic contusions in the cortex of the right and left superior frontal gyri of the brain. The brain and spinal cord showed evidence of old and recent injury which the doctors attributed to Non-accidental Injury. The condition was given the name Shaken Baby Syndrome in 1971 by a neurosurgeon Dr Guthkelch, who unsurprisingly, could offer no other explanation for the bleeding, bruises and fractures seen in these children and incredible as it may seem, neither could the doctors in the UK who reported on Amelia a year ago. I should add there are some doctors in Australia, Canada and the USA who also have the same problem causing hundreds of innocent carers to be imprisoned. Sally Clark, Angela Canning and Trupti Patel were not the last victims of medical ignorance. Amelia had a disorder of the coagulation system as shown by a raised INR of 1.3, an APTT of 39.6. which would explain the brain and other haemorrhages but the evidence was ignored by the doctors alleging murder. Their preoccupation with the Shaken Baby Syndrome hypothesis also ignored the elevation of the level of Glucose in the blood and the presence of Glucose in the Urine of Amelia. Both these features are manifestations of an Autoimmune response to antigenic stimulation as explained in the attached document [1]. In this case it was the vaccines given to Amelia a few days prior to her falling ill which initiated the process. Vaccines caused the problem and Darryl Elliot was blamed. I reported the matter to the General Medical Council and got the reply It would be inappropriate for the GMC to become involved in academic debate between groups of experts who hold differing opinions.            So it is up to the Presidents of Royal Colleges of Medicine to show some leadership and instruct their members to abandon the flat earth mainstream fabrication and adopt a rational approach. Until the Medical Profession realizes that the Shaken Baby Syndrome is a fabricated diagnosis without a shred of scientific evidence they are going to continue falsely accuse innocent people and deceiving the Judiciary. How much longer can this shameful situation continue? Parliament has an excellent example of a false conviction in the case of Darryl Elliot and should take the opportunity to rectify the situation and restore Justice to people of the land and release all falsely convicted prisoners.

1302	290	1	Thanks Ed for posting my letter.   The doctors who have accussed Darryl Eliot of murder should be made to explain how Shaking a baby causes a rise in the infant's Blood Glucose and how it causes a change in the coagulation system of the child. If they cannot give a scientific explanation then they are obviously making a false accusation of murder and the General Medical Council and the Law should take action.

1303	290	1	Tissue Scurvy  Not Shaken Baby  Abstract   Parents and Carers are often falsely accused of injuring a child asserting that unexplained bruises, fractures, retinal and subdural haemorrhages with ischaemic encephalopathy, the so called Triad are signs of physical abuse. However these features can be the result of Tissue Scurvy, a disorder of Vitamin C metabolism in which Vitamin C, although abundant in the plasma, is unable to enter the cell because of a lack of Insulin which is necessary to conduct the transfer of the Vitamin C into the cell. The cause is an autoimmune reaction which destroys the Insulin-producing Beta cells of the Pancreas in some genetically susceptible children. Here it is shown that the evidence of the Prosecution Experts alleging death from the Shaken Baby Syndrome was demonstrably flawed. The diagnosis Shaken Baby Syndrome is false and an innocent man was incarcerated. This irrational diagnosis should be abandoned.    Introduction   Mr Darryl Elliot was convicted for the murder of Amelia Bowmar on the evidence of doctors who alleged Amelia was Shaken to death. The basis of this allegation was the presence of a subdural haematoma, swelling of the brain with ischaemic changes and haemorrhagic contusions in the cortex of the right and left superior frontal gyri of the brain. The brain and spinal cord showed evidence of old and recent injury which was attributed to Non-accidental Injury.      The situation in which the carers of the child could offer no explanation for fractures, bruises, retinal and cerebral haemorrhages with ischaemic encephalopathy was given the name Shaken Baby Syndrome in 1971 by a neurosurgeon Dr Guthkelch, who unsurprisingly, could offer no other explanation for the lesions in these children and incredible as it may seem nor could the doctors in the UK who reported on Amelia Bowmar a year ago.      Amelia had a disorder of the coagulation system as shown by a raised INR of 1.3,(NR 0.89 - 1.2) an APTT of 39.6.(NR 25-35 sec) which would explain the brain and other haemorrhages but the evidence was ignored by the doctors alleging murder, who were obviously uninformed in relation to the interpretation of these and other Laboratory results. (The NR was not provided in the original report and has been added by me from my personal knowledge as a Haematologist.)      Their preoccupation with the Shaken Baby Syndrome hypothesis also ignored the elevation of the level of Glucose in the blood and the presence of Glucose in the urine of Amelia. Both these features are manifestations of an Autoimmune response to antigenic stimulation as I have explained [1]. In this case it was the vaccines given to Amelia a few days prior to her falling ill which initiated the process.      Vaccines caused the problem and Darryl Elliot was blamed. There is a simple solution to this problem- a skin prick test before administering the vaccine to determine vaccine sensitivity in the child. The test should be mandatory. .      Until the Medical Profession realizes that the Shaken Baby Syndrome is a fabricated diagnosis without a shred of scientific evidence, they are going to continue to falsely accuse innocent people and deceive the Judiciary.   Mr Justice MacDuff sentencing Darryl Elliott for the murder of his partners baby Amelia Bowmar said, You have been convicted, on overwhelming evidence, of the murder of Amelia Bowmar, a little girl of 14 months whose care had been entrusted to you by your partner; her mother. Your job was to look after and protect her but, instead, she died at your hands.   It is clear to me that because you perceived her to be misbehaving, or perhaps because you had to deal with her when she was sick, or just because you lost your temper at something wholly unconnected with her behaviour, you so violently and deliberately shook her as to the catastrophic injuries from which she died. Only you know exactly what went on inside that house on July 28 last year.   I accept that this was a spur of the moment loss of temper and also that you did not intend to kill. I also accept that you were immediately full of remorse  although that remorse has to be seen alongside an attempt to distance yourself from what you did, and a failure to acknowledge your responsibility. Your failure to tell the truth in those early hours meant that the medical teams spent time investigating other possible causes. I am satisfied that Amelia was so seriously compromised that she would have died anyway. But you were not to know that.   The Judge was obviously completely deceived by the evidence of the doctors and the overwhelming evidence he refers to when analysed is demonstrably overwhelming incorrect as demonstrated here.       --------------------------------------------------------------------------     Dr P H T Cartlidge    Specialist Field Paediatrics      Dr P H T Cartlidge in his evidence said, in my opinion the head injury was not caused by a fall from the seat of the settee and I struggle to conceive how Amelia could have climbed higher. He goes on to say the mechanism of non-accidental head injury causing an acute encephalopathic illness, acute subdural bleeding and retinal haemorrhages is thought to be shaking, an impact or a combination of both. In shaking a child is often grasped around the chest and shaken.       Squeezing the chest impairs the return of blood to the heart and thereby causes an increase in venous blood pressure. This in turn causes engorgement of the veins that traverse the subdural space on the surface of the brain. Shaking the child and/or hitting the childs head on a firm object leads to marked accellaration-decellaration forces that rupture these engorged veins, resulting in subdural haemorrhage The same shearing forces generated by shaking-impact can damage the parenchyma of the brain and also the spinal cord and cord roots.     Comment   Dr Cartlidge gives an accurate account of the mainstream opinion of the Shaken Baby Syndrome which ignores crucial biochemical evidence such as Increased Glucose in the Blood (Hyperglycaemia), Abnormal Liver Function Test, Abnormal Coagulation Tests and Glycosuria (sugar in the urine) proving an Autoimmune Disease  TISSUE SCURVY. The Shaken Baby Syndrome is unscientific speculation.  Read this article. Autoimmunity and Non-Accidental Injury in Children, Clinical Medicine Research. Vol. 2, No. 3, 2013, pp. 40-44. doi: 10.11648/j.cmr.20130203.15   Abstract  Background: The Shaken Baby Syndrome conceived by Guthkeltch to explain bruises, fractures, retinal and cerebral haemorrhage and encephalopathy in children, called the triad, can be explained by an autoimmune reaction to antigens in a genetically susceptible child. Method: Children diagnosed as suffering from Non-accidental injuries were investigated for evidence of immune response reactions following mandated vaccination and childhood illnesses. Results: It was found in all the cases reported here the response to antigenic stimulation damaged the Beta cells in the Pancreas causing Hypoinsulinaemia which inhibited the cellular uptake of Vitamin C resulting in liver dysfunction, failure of carboxylation of the Vitamin K dependent proteins resulting in haemorrhages and fractures associated with the triad. Conclusion: Fractures, retinal and subdural haemorrhages and encephalopathy in children  is an autoimmune response to antigenic stimulation in a genetically susceptible individual. Common antigens are the mandated vaccines, viral bacterial and parasitic infections. Keywords Shaken, Baby, Non-accidental, Injury, Triad \    ------------------------------------------------------------     Dr S J Hamilton, Forensic Pahology Unit Leeds       Dr S J Hamilton, Forensic Pahology Unit Leeds who, with his colleague Dr Malcomson, performed the Postmotem examination on Amelia also gave evidence for the prosecution in which he stated having considered all the findings with respect to the death of Amelia, it is my opinion that she as(sic) died of a head and spinal injuries. Neuropathology has revealed recent injuries including subdural bleeding, axonal injury in the medulla and spinal nerve roots, and fresh bleeding within older contusions within the brain itself. There is also evidence of older injury including older subdural bleeding and cerebral contusions. These are indicative of at least one, but possibly more than one, episode of significant head trauma. These neuropathological appearances are entirely consistent with non-accidental injury also referred to as paediatric head injury or sometimes Adult Induced Injury. Although some authors have proposed theoretical models that would indicate a natural single underlying cause leading to the finding of subdural haematoma brain swelling and retinal haemorrhage to my knowledge these theoretical models have not been accepted by the Courts. The presence of this combination of findings is entirely consistent with a traumatic etiology. The lack of external injury means that it is not possible to state that there has been an impact to the head, although the possibility of an impact that has not left an external injury must exist.     Comment  I am one of the authors that have proposed theoretical models that would indicate a natural single underlying cause leading to the finding of subdural haematoma brain swelling and retinal haemorrhage. Amelia had an elevated Blood Glucose and Glucose in her Urine, features which confirm a diagnosis of Tissue Scurvy as reported in the manuscript below.        Title  Tissue Scurvy and the Triad   Abstract.   The Triad, characterized by bilateral retinal haemorrhages, diffuse cerebral haemorrhage and hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy is conventionally thought to result from trauma caused by violently shaking a child by a parent or carer. The shaking is said to cause a to and fro movement of the brain in the skull leading to injury to the neurons, disruption of the cerebral veins and trauma to the retinal vessels. Vigorous shaking of a child has never been observed and an alternative explanation for these changes was sought. Here it is shown that Tissue Scurvy, an autoimmune disorder which has specific and consistent biochemical features of Hyperglycaemia and Liver Dysfunction as shown by abnormal Liver Function Tests, is the cause of the lesions.   A child diagnosed as being the victim of the Shaken Baby Syndrome was tested for evidence of Tissue Scurvy and both Hyperglycaemia and Abnormal Liver Function were demonstrated. It is concluded that these results provide conclusive evidence that the Shaken Baby Syndrome is a form of Tissue Scurvy in which encephalopathy is caused by damage to neurons in the cervical spinal column causing hypoxia, which leads to ischaemic encephalopathy and the other features of the triad.       ----------------------------------------------------   Dr Jayamohan Jayaratnam    Consultant Paediatric Neurosurgeon     Dr Jayamohan Jayaratnam discussed all the available evidence including the fact that Initial blood clotting tests show some raised clotting times with an INR of 1.3, an APTT of 39.6 and an APTT ratio of 1.3. With support from the evidence of Dr AL SARRAG concluded in my view this sufficient support for my already formed view that there is likely to have been a traumatic explanation for Amelias collapse. In view the globalized findings of ischaemia, it was hard to place exactly what may have occurred. However with the focal injuries described by Dr AL SARRAG, in view of the absence of external signs of injury and in view of the bilateral severe ophthalmology findings, I believe it is highly indicative that a non-impact traumatic injury otherwise known as a shaking type injury has occurred to Amelia.     Comment    Dr Jayamohan clearly identifies an abnormality of the clotting mechanism and then, for no reason whatever, chooses to ignore it as a cause of the bleeding in the skull and elsewhere. His illogical conclusion needs to be further investigated by his governing body for the safety of others with similar coagulation profiles.  Others may suffer the same fate as Darryl Elliot if he continues to hold this view.   --------------------------------------------         Dr Neil Gordon Stoodley  Consultant Neuroradiologist      Dr Neil Gordon Stoodley Consultant Neuroradiologist concluded his assessment of the situation with the remark I cannot think of a biologically plausible mechanism that would potentially directly link any event occurring toward the end of May 2012 and Amelias presentation with a severe (indeed fatal) encephalopathic illness at the end of July.      The scan abnormalities are all explicable on the basis of being due to an episode of non-accidental head injury. The mechanism of the injury is likely to have involved shaking. Majority medical opinion is of the view that what is likely to be required to produce such injuries is the backwards and forward movement of the unsupported infant head pivoting on the neck. It is believed that this leads to a degree of acceleration/deceleration and rotational forces and that the consequent differential rotation of the brain and skull leads to stretching of the subdural veins which cross the subdural space and it is this which leads to bleeding in the subdural space.     Comment  Dr Stoodley could not think of a biologically plausible mechanism that would potentially directly link any event occurring toward the end of May 2012 and Amelias presentation with a severe (indeed fatal) encephalopathic illness at the end of July.     The biologically plausible mechanism Dr Stoodley has difficulty in thinking of that would potentially directly link an event occurring toward the end of May 2012 and Amelias presentation with severe (indeed fatal) encepalopathic illness at the end of July is the MMR vaccine administered on 25th May 2012.  An account of the condition-TISSUE SCURVY- which doctors including Dr Stoodley are obviously unaware of is featured below. When doctors understand Tissue Scurvy can be induced by vaccines in genetically susceptible children and causes the signs and symptoms found in Amelia, they will stop diagnosing Shaken Baby Syndrome.

Retired Haematologist, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia  To cite this article   Michael D Innis, Autoimmune Tissue Scurvy Misdiagnosed as Child Abuse, Clinical Medicine Research. Vol. 2, No. 6, 2013, pp. 154-157. doi: 10.11648/j.cmr.20130206.17   Abstract  Requests from distressed parents and relatives seeking help after having been falsely accused by doctors of injuring their children are not uncommon. Viral and parasitic infections and vaccines cause an autoimmune disorder, Tissue Scurvy, misdiagnosed as child abuse. This report presents the evidence. Method. Relevant hospital and laboratory reports of three children were examined for evidence of Tissue Scurvy as the cause of the neurological lesions, fractures, bruises and haemorrhages found on them. Results. In all the cases in which appropriate histories and tests were done there was evidence that the doctors either misinterpreted the laboratory evidence or they were unaware of the significance of abnormal tests suggesting Tissue Scurvy as the cause. Conclusion. Some doctors are unaware of the pathophysiological processes of autoimmunity, haemostasis and osteogenesis and are misdiagnosing vaccine induced Tissue Scurvy, absence of Vitamin C within the cell, as Non-accidental Injury.  Keywords  Autoimmunity, Tissue Scurvy, Encephalomyelitis, Non-accidental Injury, Shaken Baby Syndrome          --------------------------------------------------------------           Dr AL-SARRAJ    Consultant Neuropathologist   Dr AL-SARRAJ provides a detailed account of the findings and concludes the clinical history indicates presence of extensive bilateral retinal haemorrhages. These injuries, in addition to the presence of subdural haematoma and generalized ischemia (ischaemic encephalopathy) form the triad frequently seen in patients with non-accidental head injury. This is further supported by presence of subdural haematoma in the spinal cord, axonal injury in the pyramids of the medulla and axonal injury in the spinal nerve roots.   The presence of axonal injury in the pyramids and spinal nerve roots suggest head and spinal cord injury resulting from violent hyper-extension and hyper-flexion of the head and neck similar to those seen in shaking. The presence of extensive retinal haemorrhages supports this suggestion.   The pathological findings in the brain have to be considered closely with other findings of autopsy examination, radiological examination, eye examination and other investigations, before final conclusion. I will review the pathological findings in the brain and my interpretation if further information becomes available.     Conclusion  Head and spinal cord injury consistent with non-accidental injury.     Comment  There is no conflict with Dr AL-SARRAJS findings but it is the interpretation of those findings which are disputed. He is evidently prepared to review his interpretation if further information becomes available and I draw his attention to the fact that Amelia had Biochemical as well as Anatomical lesions. The Biochemical lesions of Hyperglycaemia, Glycosuria, Coagulation Abnormality (INR 1,3, APTT 39.6) all suggest an Autoimmune Disorder TISSUE SCURVY [1] which I am sure Dr AL-SARRAJ is willing to consider.

Vol. 2, No. 6, 2013, pp. 154-157. doi: 10.11648/j.cmr.20130206.17             Dr R E Bonshak   Consultant Ophthalmic Pathologist      Dr Bonshak gives a detailed account of the pathological changes seen in the eye when exposed to infection and injury and concludes non-traumatic injuries which might possibly cause this form and extent of pathology include severe coagulopathy (bleeding disorder) leukaemia (with coagulopathy) septicaemia(with coagulopathy) meningitis(with coagulopathy)and catastrophic intracranial bleeding. I am not aware that these conditions have been identified.     Comment  The Hospital Records and Pathology Report of Amelia clearly showed:  1. INR (International Normalized Ratio) 1.3 (Normal Range added by me 2 - 4.5)  2. APTT(Accelerated Partial Thromboplastin Time) 39.6 sec(Normal added by me 27-35 sec)     Having been a Haematologist in a Teaching Hospital I HAVE REPORTED ON MANY THOUSANDS OF HAEMATOLOGICAL RESULTS. These results indicate that a Coagulopathy is present due to the reduction in the Clotting factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII and spontaneous bleeding is inevitable. It also indicates that the Liver is damaged because these factors are formed in the Liver.      Dr Bonshak has the evidence of a coagulopathy he requires to conclude non-traumatic injuries which might possibly cause this form and extent of pathology .         Conclusion   Darryl Elliot has been found guilty of murder on the evidence of doctors not competent in interpreting the Haematological evidence which clearly indicated a Coagulopathy caused the death of Amelia Bowmar.

1304	290	1	The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) has ruled that Dr Squier had given irresponsible evidence outside her area of expertise in a number of court cases.      I want to be clear here that I am not discussing the formal hearing at all, just that an expert changes their opinion having held the consensus view for many years. Neither I am commenting on whether her opinion on SBS is correct or not. Just how difficult is it to change an overwhelming consensus amongst the medical profession about some aspect of care? Doesn't it often take a Doctor or group of Doctors to not side with the majority for change to be made?

My initial thought about Dr Squier is simply that if she was acting outside her competence just who can give an opinion on SBS - and in condemning her could the GMC panel have been acting outside its competence.   Ther are undoubtedly doctors who push themselves forward to be ""expert"" witnesses for one reason or another . It is a brave or foolish person who does this over SBS and my impression was that she was not in the foolish category. Except in not keeping clear of ""tiger country"" I will look through the reference I have not yet read to see if I should change my mind, The few neuropathologists I have know have been very thoughtful - if a bit otherworldly - folk.

1306	290	1	If I've understood correctly, both the originalproponent of pathological evidence for 'shaken baby syndrome' and now the person challenging the validity of that evidence have been 'discredited'. That's really an extraordinary state of affairs. The meaning and interpretationof 'scientific evidence' is much more complex and nuanced than the establishment realises, particularly when both principalparadigmsseem nowto havebeen discredited.Particularly ironicwhen the accusations of acting outside her competence have been made by such a body as the GMC, allegedly with the support of the police, neither body having been strangers to this accusation themselves.   I can only hope that the press publish thenames of the panel members casting the stones if and when the fragilty of this'scientific evidence' finallycomes to be accepted.A defence of having given their honest opinions will, of course have been rendered invalid by their own reasoning in this case.-8ez7g0b5a7jjihrat2wyc3a	Maxim	13/3/2016 5:48 PM	0	0
1307	290	1	"Maxim - Not their names but the Guardian lists the panel members as including (but I think 3 is the usual number anyway) : a retired RAF officer , a retired policeman and a retired community psychiatrist. Just the combination of folk qualified to weigh up the evidence in this highly complex and tricky territory? Presumably there will be an appeal.   It is awful emotional and judicial territory : damning the parent may mean a death penalty in the USA and nearly as bad in the UK (just think what treatment the ""culprit"" will have in prison) . Letting a killer walk free seems not quite so awful - I do not know about follow-up but I would guess that some of these cases are where someone has just ""flipped"" and has to live with that anyway. I gather part of the problem was that she felt that the damage was not caused ""deiberately"" in the cases being considered.   Apart from the panel it would be interesting to know who were the expert witnesses and how big a pool there is of these Some od the problem seems to have related to how Dr Squier presented her evidence and I think many of us are aware just how problematic that can be.-p93arz4"	sken	13/3/2016 6:34 PM	0	0

1309	291	1	"In his final judgement the Judge set out the salient facts thus:      'Mrs C was born in 1956. At the time of the Angiogram she was 52. Her past medical history included heart burn, indigestion, ME, and IBS. In the past she has had episodes of depression, has complained of panic attacks and has long been anxious about her health. She has, in common with many, exhibited a dislike of medical procedures. On 14 April 2009, Mrs C complained to her GP of symptoms that were consistent with, or suggestive of, angina pectoris. As a consequence, she was referred to hospital where she attended for investigation on 28 April 2009. Following that consultation, Dr S of the hospital staff wrote to her GP:      ""- chest pain history - considered to be suggestive of angina  Occurred on exercise, relieved by rest ... Risk factors for heart disease- patient stop smoking started 1970 stopped 2000 smoked on average 20 per day no history of strokes ... Examination heart sounds normal Apex beat, JVP normal. Carotid pulse was normal. The following heart murmurs were present: ESM Grade: 3 Respiratory system: normal. Investigations- ECG. Clinical diagnosis of possible angina . Patient referred for echocardiogram  Typical chest pain, ex smoker, systolic murmur at the base of the heart. Echo and ETT arranged as urgent.""      An echocardiogram was performed on Mrs C on 25 May 2009, reported as normal. On 3 June 2009, Mrs C performed an exercise test following which Dr G of the hospital recommended that an angiogram be performed on Mrs C. Dr G provided Mrs C with a consent form preparatory to performance of the angiogram. In addition, Mrs C was sent an information sheet that explained the procedure in detail, and described risks involved with the procedure. In particular, the information sheet stated that:   "" As all blood vessels are connected to the heart, gently passing the catheters through the arteries and veins carries them painlessly into the heart  In skilled and experienced hands problems are uncommon. Nevertheless, there is a small risk that a badly narrowed artery will block during the test. This can cause a myocardial infarction (heart attack) which can have serious consequences. This is more a risk of the disease rather than the technique ""      Mrs C duly signed the consent form and, on 19 June 2009, attended the catheter laboratory.      The timing and sequence of events in the course of Mrs C's angiogram was not fully recorded as the equipment used does not automatically record what is visible during the procedure. However, the operator may record sequences of moving pictures of interest, in the course of the procedure and on a CD of Mrs C's angiogram, 48 sequences of moving pictures showing the procedure at different times are recorded. In Mrs C's case the procedure commenced at about 11.00 a.m. when a local anaesthetic was given and an incision was made in her right arm to permit access for a catheter via her radial artery. Soon after the insertion of the catheter Mrs C began to suffer from spasm and pain in her right arm so the catheter was withdrawn. Another attempt to perform the angiogram via the radial approach was unsuccessful and therefore some minutes later, Dr M abandoned that approach and decided to attempt access via the femoral artery. Mrs C was given a local anaesthetic in her leg and at about 11.30 a.m and a catheter inserted via the femoral artery.   During the procedure staff monitored Mrs C's blood pressure and ECG. At the commencement of the procedure the ECG record had been calibrated to zero and a baseline ECG was undertaken. The ECG was continuously monitored but it was not continuously recorded.      The prescription record shows 3 mg of morphine and 1.25 mg of diazepam at 11.20 a.m. It shows that between 11.20 a.m. and 11.50 a.m. a further 3 mg of morphine and 2.25 mg of diazepam was dispensed. In the course of the procedure Mrs C complained of pain in her right arm and of severe pain across her back, chest and jaw. It is agreed that she complained of pain in the right arm as soon as the spasm developed in her right arm; when she first complained of the other symptoms of pain is a central issue in this case. At an early stage in the course of the procedure Dr M saw from images obtained of Mrs C's heart that her left descending artery was occluded. This is a serious and potentially life threatening condition as that artery serves about 40% of the muscle of the heart. The detection of that condition turned the procedure being performed on Mrs C from an angiogram to an angioplasty. In Mrs C's case the identified occlusion was cleared by insertion of a balloon and then two stents into the arterial system of her heart, the stents being employed at about 12.30 p.m. when it first became visible on X-ray that there had been a dissection of the left main stem artery. Whether that occurred shortly after the angiogram procedure was begun via the radial route or only after the femoral route was begun is another important issue in this action.      At some time after Dr M determined that the LAD was occluded he called for the attendance of Dr B, the supervising cardiologist who probably arrived at or about the time when the femoral catheter was inserted. In consequence of the dissection, on 19 June 2009, Mrs C was transferred to another hospital. On 29 June 2009, at that hospital two further stents were inserted into Mrs C's arterial system. She was discharged on 6 July 2009.'      'When giving evidence Mrs C said that after the procedure began she felt an severe pain in her right arm of which she complained to the medical staff. She said that she heard the doctor , Dr M say ""is she 32 or 52?"" and she said, ""I'm 52, ..why does this matter?"" to which Dr M replied that younger women usually go into spasm if it is put in the arm. He then said, ""We'll go in her leg instead"" to which Mrs C said ""I don't want you to"" to which Dr M answered, ""It won't take long as we've put it in your leg now."" Mrs C said that she was confused and afraid and that she had lost confidence in the ability of the staff to carry out the procedure painlessly and repeatedly said, ""I need this to stop now."" Dr M said, ""I've seen one side and the artery's clear and looks good, I just need to get round the other side. It shouldn't take a minute."" Mrs C said, ""I don't want you to, I need this to stop now. 'I then experienced the most excruciating pain of my life across my back and my chest and my jaw."" She said in her evidence before me that in the course of the procedure he was calm, reassuring, sought to put her at her ease and seemed ""fine in his attitude.""      Mrs C'a case was that Dr M should have abandoned the procedure after she complained of pain in her right arm that was consistent with spasm. She told him at that stage that she wanted it to stop and if he had done so she would not subsequently have agreed to it being continued, whatever the doctor had said to her, and the dissection would not therefore have occurred. She withdrew her consent for the procedure to continue before access was attempted via the femoral route and that she did not complain of ""excruciating"" pain until after access to her arterial system had been gained by the femoral route'.         The crux of Mrs C's case was that:      1. She did not provide valid consent for the angiogram as she was provided with misleading information before the commencement of the procedure.      2. Secondly, that she withdrew such consent as she had given before access via the femoral route was undertaken and it was only after this time that she sustained a dissection of the LAD.      The defendant hospital maintained that:      1. It did not provide misleading information overall. Even if it was misleading, they claimed, it did not vitiate her consent. They do not admit consent was withdrawn during the procedure.      2. They assert that at the material time, Mrs C did not have capacity to withdraw consent and therefore any apparent withdrawal of consent was not valid. Mrs C asserts, however, that at the time she withdrew consent she was fully conscious and aware of events such that she could withdraw her consent. In particular she says the medication she received would not have been sufficient to have affected her capacity. The Defendant also asserts that an event that threatened Mrs C's life occurred before withdrawal of her consent such that the staff of the hospital were entitled to ignore any suggestion from her that she wished them.      Had Mrs C withdrawn consent? Did she have capacity to withdraw consent? Would the drugs given to her have affected her ability to withdraw consent?      kirked-cc1ueej31ah1q7bh80b9eqm4w3cd62bvx4fn8cwm6fsa58gpih2g8kd4bg8lg1qubg2qg64dzey275540aumahuze0mv1"	kirked	6/1/2016 5:30 AM	0	0
1310	291	1	"You are up early, kirked!  Or else a long way around the globe.   And strangely, the timing of your post says you came after Silverfox, when the content looks as if they were replying to yours.  Another board glitch? I'll ask the IT gurus.   But anyway, it has always been my understanding that someone who has been premedicated cannot give consent, which in the current practice of admission as late as possible before operation denies some nervous people of that opportunity.  Once a patent is anaesthetised, the question of withdrawing thir consent does not arise, and it's a pity that the UK has not followed the practice of other countries, or that of dental surgery, in allowing the operator to supervise sedation.     Because I sympathise with the operator.  They have nearly completed the procedure - to withdraw now wastes time, effort, cost and will expose the patient to the same risk on a second occasion, doubling that risk. If some one else were at the head-end, who could more closley reassure the anxious patient, thier anxiety might not overload, and equally there might be fewer overdoses. I admire the reassurance skills of nurses, but they cannot titrate doses of sedatives, only give them on instruction, in this situation from the distracted operator.   For it is difficult to say that a patient asking, telling you to stop cannot withdraw their consent, even if they are sedated. The effect of benzodiazepines is similar to that of alcohol, they 'disinhibit' the patient. So the repressed office worker becomes a sexual pest at the Xmas office party, and the patient who has their anxiety under control loses it when sedated and stressed by the procedure.  Silverfox, for this reason I don't agree that ""Versed"" (AKA UK midazolam) is an excellent drug, and fentanyl is one that few understand.   While rapid in effect and apparently offset too, it is actually one of the slowest drugs to be excreted. In small dose this doesn't matter, even when the excretion half life is about six hours, but give more than a little and you run into problems.   ALWAYS have naloxone and flumazenil to hand, but remember that the half life of naloxone is much, much less than fentanyl.   Anaesthetists might more likely to use a propofol infusion with either alfentanyl which has a much shorter half life, or remifentanyl which is so quickly broken down that it too must be given by infusion.  This technique is more flexible and less likely to overdose the patient.   The alfentanyl and propofol combination is used in the UK in Emergency Departments for sedation for dislocation reduction and other painful procedures.  By adopting strict guidelines it has proved successful and safe, despite the alarmist concerns of anaesthetists, including this one, but as far as I know has not been used in cardiology labs.

1311	291	1	"We'll have to wait for Kirked to give the judge's ruling but this sort ofdetailed discussion of a dilemma shows how the apparent clearcut theory of consentmay not benot so clear in the messy world of clinical practice.   Although I've myself repeated the trainingmantra of 'stop when the patient says stop' it's not as black and white as suggested by SILVRFOX (even though I feel at one with him because of the name which has also been applied to me!) Whistle-blowing by other staff should not occur in a functional team where each member is properly and fully involved and where decisions are properly discussed. Even then the final responsibility ends up beingwith one person ratherthan distributed.   There's an additional risk to the ones listed by John D. There are times in many procedures when, to stop, would risk a serious or fatal occurrence. Imagine, for example, the colonoscopic removal of a large polyp using snare diathermy. When half way through the stalk it's not usuallyan option to abandon the procedure, one has to finish safely without rushing. Similarly, with coronary procedures, I imagine that it could be disastrous to withdraw as a stent is being deployed to treat a lesion likely to cause an imminent complete blockage of a coronary artery. Whilst the patient might well claim later to have had full capacity, it's quite possible that theycould claim the opposite if the procedure was abandoned and the patient suffered serious harm.   It's these decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and with competing risks that make these detailedcases valuable for all clinicians to consider.   The original consent is another topic but I would suggest it's impossible for patients to make a fully informed decision if the operator describes a general position of "" In skilled and experienced hands problems are uncommon"" rather than giving their own results.-vj3c8ck2h2imgzbw0fue4d4bzewkvd8d8"	Maxim	8/1/2016 2:17 PM	0	0
1312	291	1	"Maxim - and during a procedure such as colonoscopy , there is the added issue of whether the patient is really making an informed decision particularly when a benzodiazepine has been used. I recall the evening ward round with a youngish women complaining that she had not yet had her procedure , when we had curtailed this hours before at her request.   As regards the big polyps : an anecdote , I recall being persuaded by a surgical colleague to ""have a go"" at a vast beast (4cms+)in an elderly man. Half way through I chickened out of this very firm , very thick stalk , dismantled the snare and came out with a view to seeking surgical help. Encouraged to keep going (if you can do it it will save the patient from surgery which may kill him) I went back in and using another snare all went well. Not perhaps now , when there is so much experience of when and how to tackle these things , but there have been times when I think cardiac monitoring advisable for the operator rather than for the patient?    The realisation of slipping out of one's depth mid procedure is of great educational value but there is a problem if it happens too often.-xn4a30"	sken	9/1/2016 3:35 PM	0	0

1314	291	1	"SILVRFOX - Sounds excellent advice but the problem is when the tricky events arise. There is a big - and i think to some extent unresolved issue around sedation. The anaesthesia recomendations are not ideal when involved in what is essentially terminal care. In those circumstances I think one has to be prepared to step outside eg give adequate pain relief but know how to give it. This was not infrequent a problem when stenting oesophageal malignancy. Awaiting amaesthetic cover for the procedure may mean postponing it (nil by mouth etc... ) for a week , which can be an appreciable proportion of remaining life and stopping the patient returning home. So one also needs education on how to break the excellent safety rules : the harm can be in NOT going ahead or leaving the patient in distress?   I recall one patient - treated by laser elsewhere - where much of the mediastinum had been damaged - the gullet lumen just led into a gaping hole shared with both main bronchi. Of course one could have come out and postponed everything but the sensible course of action seemed to be to slip a stent in whilst keeping the patient comfortable. It seemed to work. How should I have interpreted ""Do no harm"" - discontinue ? Not give analgaesia if the patient had pain?   All eventualities cannot be foreseen although this is less of a problem now. Part of teaching fundamentals is so that the doctor can make decisions when a new scenario emerges. As a general observation our guidelines aim at a medical version of safety - but sometimes the patient may be just as concerned with pain relief , something which is often neglected.-fi7bd87"	sken	10/1/2016 5:28 PM	0	0

1316	291	1	"Many thanks for the responses thus far. May I just add part of Dr M's statement directly relevant to the issue of IV sedation and the possible problems with terminating the procedure (in line with comments already posted):   ""I do not recall Mrs C requesting the procedure to stop at this point. However, the procedure had now turned into a medical emergency and I was not concentrating on conversations with Mrs C, but rather was concentrating on saving her life and ensuring that all necessary analgesics and sedatives were provided to make her as comfortable as possible in the circumstance. It is possible that Mrs C asked for the procedure to stop due to the pain of predominantly the blocked coronary artery, and also secondarily due to the radial spasms. If Mrs C had asked for the procedure to stop it would not have been possible to do so at this stage without catastrophic and life threatening consequences. I do not recall feeling at any point that Mrs C was ""withdrawing consent"" and I would certainly recall if this was the case. I do not undertake any invasive procedure without consent unless it is a lifesaving emergency situation. In this case, Mrs C was in a critical situation very soon after the start of the procedure and needed rapid emergency treatment. In this situation it is my job, and the job of the nurses, to try and relieve the patient of any pain and reassure them. I note that intravenous diazepam, midazolam and morphine were administered to Mrs C to provide pain relief and to give sedation. We had a low threshold to give sedative and opiate analgesics intravenously for pain in the catheterisation lab in 2009. We would give as much analgesia as needed and the dose may vary between individuals. Mrs C received multiple doses of diazepam, midazolam and morphine. My angiogram report says a total of 13mg morphine and 6mg of diazepam was administered soon after Mrs C experienced pain. As these are given intravenously, their effect is almost instantaneous. It is standard practice for the nurses to be talking to the patient throughout the angiogram procedure and explain what is happening, as the operator is under great pressure and needs to make very important decisions quickly. However, explaining what is happening to a patient who is in pain and under the influence of the above mentioned drugs is very difficult. I note that that Mrs C says that she believes she may have lost consciousness and she states that her recollection of events is patchy. The diazepam and morphine could have caused her to have a period of no recollection/ 13mg of morphine is a high dose for patient not accustomed to taking morphine and 6mg of diazepam is enough to make a person of low body weight such as Mrs C very sleepy'.   kirked-qk6e6foiuf8h1h2l7imck3gxik60au"	kirked	11/1/2016 5:06 PM	0	0

I would however argue with his description of the effects of midazolam and morphine as being ""almost instantaneous"". The maximum effect of morphine, even IV,takes place five to ten minutes after administration, and midazolam is only a little quicker. That ""13mg of morphine is a high dose for patient not accustomed to taking morphine and 6mg of diazepam is enough to make a person of low body weight such as Mrs C very sleepy"" is indeed true, and I fear may be the result of repeated titration without adequate time for effect.

1318	292	1	I have frequently reported medical law cases. Perhaps some may be interested in what was probably the first reported case concerning malpractice. This case was reported in 1829. Thomas Wakley was the defendant but only because he reported on an operation in his new medical journal, the Lancet.      In March 1828 The Lancet published a Hospital Report entitled The operation of lithotomy by Mr Bransby Cooper which lasted nearly one hour!, and consisted of an alarming description of a hopelessly incompetent attempt on the part of Bransby Cooper to remove a bladder calculus from a strong and healthy patient who died shortly after the operation. Not only did Cooper lose his way anatomically, he lost his head, and his panicky use of multiple instruments, and his barked and desperate orders to his assistants were observed by a number of his surgical colleagues. Cooper was only appointed a Surgeon because of his connections. Wakley was clear in the Lancet to state that Cooper was a poor surgeon and would not have been appointed but for nepotism. He went on to describe the operation.      The report described an intensely melodramatic account of the operation itself, presented as a theatrical tragedy in two acts. Act 1 opened with a description of the patient, Stephen Pollard, an apparently healthy labourer from Sussex. After he was placed on the table and bound (because there was no anaesthetic) Mr Callaway, Cooper's assistant, held the straight staff while Cooper attempted to make an incision in Pollard's perineum. The opening made, forceps were now handed over and for some time attempted to be introduced, but without effect. Cooper, declaring that the aperture was not sufficient, allegedly called for my uncle's knife to widen it. The forceps were then reintroduced and pushed onwards to a considerable distance, and with no small degree of force. The first act closed with Cooper declaring that Pollard's perineum was very deep and that he could not reach the bladder with his finger.      Act 2 opened in even more dramatic fashion, with Pollard subjected to 'such a horrific and invasive assault as to defy syntactic coherence: The staff re-introduced and cutting gorget passed along it  various forceps employed: a blunt gorget  a scoop  sounds and staves introduced at the opening in the perineum. I really can't conceive the difficulty, Cooper declared, before asking one of his attendants if they had a longer finger than his own so that they might reach the stone. Good God, he exclaimed the forceps won't touch it  O dear! O dear!      'Such were the hurried exclamations of the operator every now and then there was a cry of Hush! which was succeeded by the stillness of death, broken only by the horrible squash, squash of the forceps in the perineum'. By this time Pollard was in unimaginable pain and repeatedly begged Cooper to stop and let his stone keep in. Cooper persisted, however, and after nearly an hour he finally managed to extract it. With Pollard still bound to the table, Cooper proceeded to address his audience, declaring, once more, that he could not conceive of the difficulty. Finally the exhausted Pollard was put to bed and though he initially rallied, death ended the poor fellow's sufferings, about 29 hours after the operation.      The publication of the report and its subsequent notice in The Times caused an immediate sensation. Wakley stated inter Alia '....the real issue was not Cooper's private character, it was whether he performed the late operation with that degree of skill, which the public has a right to expect from a surgeon of Guy's Hospital  whether the unfortunate patient lost his life  because 'it was the turn of a surgeon to operate, who is indebted for his elevation to the influence of a corrupt system, and who  would never have been placed in a situation of such deep responsibility as that which he now occupies, had he not been the nephew of Sir Astley Cooper. This is  the only question, in which the public is interested'.      Wakley then reconfigured the report as more a systemic critique rather than personal defamation. Although the word libel had been bandied around, there was as yet no clear indication that Cooper would seek legal redress. Even so, Wakley positively invited the prospect. Whether this investigation be of a judicial character or not, we are indifferent, he claimed, with feigned insouciance. What was unquestionable was that there would be an investigation, not into Wakley's actions or the harm that had been done to Cooper's reputation, but rather into what Mr Harrison, the treasurer of Guy's Hospital, knows  [are] the extraordinary circumstances attending his elevation to his present situation. Like Wooler, Hone and others before him, Wakley was preparing to turn the situation to his advantage, to transform the courtroom into an arena for the articulation of radical discourse. Defying his legally allotted role as defendant by electing to act as his own counsel, it was a drama in which he would take centre stage.      The trial was heard promptly and began on 12 December 1828 in the Court of the Queens Bench before Lord Tenterden. Cooper was represented by Sir James Scarlett (a notorious opponent of the popular press and frequent target of radical satire). Wakley defended himself and conducted his defence with great skill and made the important point that not only should hospitals aspire to the highest standards of care, but mechanisms should be in place to ensure that standards are set and met. Wakeley's belief in the rightness of his cause made him a difficult witness to shake under Scarlett's aggressive cross-examination. Much of Scarlett's defence of Bransby Cooper relied - probably inadvisedly - on the fact that he had been chosen by Astley Cooper as someone fit to practise at Guy's. Scarlett attempted to discredit Mr Lambert, The Lancet reporter, but Wakeley was able to produce Cooper's assistant at the operation Mr Calloway, who confirmed the precise details that had been reported in The Lancet. After a long case the jury deliberated for two hours and returned a verdict for the plaintiff, but for damages of only 100. This was another triumph for Wakeley and The Lancet, and was recognized nationally as a landmark case. Wakley's legal costs amounted to over 400, and this amount was quickly raised by public subscription, with the excess funds being forwarded to the widow of Cooper's unfortunate patient, whose bladder calculus has been preserved in the Gordon Museum at King's Hospital.

1320	293	1	Two Nurses have been sent to prison for falsifying patient results. Between them, three Nurses (the third received a community order) they faked 81 blood glucose results. Most of the patients had had a stroke and were having their blood sugar assessed two hourly. They said pressure of work and dissatisfaction played a part in their 'wilful neglect'. One nurse felt she could catch up later with the sugar measurements.     http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-35090879      The Judge said 'I pause to remind myself that you all would have seen worried relatives coming and going, sitting with their mothers, fathers or spouses as they lay ill, some approaching the end of their lives, and to wonder with bemusement how you could have continued to betray your patients and those families as you did....This was not a failure to do your job, it was a failure of compassion and humanity. This was clear-eyed and calculated deception, the purpose of which was to make the defendants' working time easier. There was also... a real risk to health, even if that risk happily did not materialise'.      I make no particular comment about this case which is specifically concerned with wilful neglect but am interested whether criminalising medical error or mistakes (quite different to the case at hand) is a deterrent to poor or dangerous practice? Most mistakes I see are not deliberate or calculated. Most often there is a momentary slip or perhaps poor judgement. Does criminal punishment deter error by others? Most Doctors are trying to do the right thing but often organisational or system failures are the underlying culprit. Criminal law is concerned with punishment, retribution and deterrence. A criminal investigation and trial could be catastrophic for a Doctor irrespective of the outcome.      Contrary to common perception there is no real evidence that criminal prosecutions of Doctors and Nurses has increased (publicity has certainly increased). Nor is there evidence that high profile cases over the last decade or so have improved patient safety or accountability. In the well known case of Drs Prentice and Sullman, the fatal mistake of accidentally administering vincristine into a patients spine arose again a few years later resulting in the death of an eighteen-year old outpatient, Wayne Jowett, who had been in remission from leukemia. It was reported to be the thirty-sixth incident of a fatal injection of vincristine worldwide.      Furthermore, I am pretty sure that fear of litigation discourages the open admission of error.      Certainly there are cases where criminal prosecution is exactly appropriate. Absolute recklessness or deliberately causing harm must surely merit prosecution. But such cases, thankfully are rare.      Kirked-gt6evbx0c8v5equhdsjd126254	kirked	14/12/2015 6:09 PM	0	0
1321	293	1	"As you point out, kirked, the more usual 'medical mistake' is completely different from the recent case, of wilful neglect. Instead, many are due to a decison or choice made in a pressured situation, or are the result of the holes in the Swiss Cheese Model all lining up:http://patientsafetyed.duhs.duke.edu/module_e/swiss_cheese.html     The vincristine story is a dreadfully good example, and while solutions or more permutations of the cheese slices are now available, they are very slowly taken up.   'Safety' spinal needles, that have the Luer connections reversed so that only a special syringe can be connected, are now available.  Anaesthetists, who although they never use vincristine must use more spinal needles than any other specialty, felt that standardising on these needles would provide that further layer in the cheese, with less chance of the vincristine getting through. https://www.aagbi.org/sites/default/files/Neuraxial%20position%20statement.pdf   My own Department made this change and removed ordinary spinal needles from use, pour encourager les autres, but as far as I know, local oncology departments have not, and I can find no paper that documents the take-up in oncology of this measure. I fear that a thirty-seventh spinal vincristine injection is bound to happen sometime soon.   Should the doctor who gives it be pilloried?  I don't think so, but the Director of that oncology unit should be.   The WHO surgical checklist was intended to prevent the many ""Never"" events that can and do occur - wrong side, wrong operation, wrong patient, retained objects etc.http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/checklist/en/ and I can sayin my own practice that the procedure has prevented mistakes, but there is no evidence of its value.  Unsurprising, when audits that have been done have found it was used in as little as a third of operations.   Indeed, the Cochrane system has been able to find only two reports in the world on wrong site surgery that satisfy their criteria. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25821069   When organsiations ignore potential safety measures, which even when introduced are not implemented or not auditted, what hope has the individual that their momentary inattention will not damage their patient?

1323	293	1	It can't be right to criminalise someone, usually careful,who never knewabout the riskthere's the rub. How is it that the same sort of disastrous mistake can occur over and over againwhen equipment change/ban would make it almost impossible to occur. A similar thing happened with the inadvertent intravenous injection of strong potassium solution which had been mistaken for something innocuous. I think it would be difficult now to find amoules of strong potassium available in anyclinical areas but I may be wrong. At what point could the legal system expect and require that every clinician is aware of the risk and that counter measures are universally available? If that were the case then I could understand how criminal liablity might follow such a mistake being made again in contravention of known safetyrules.   Many doc2doc members will remember the fanfare, some years ago,that accompanied an expert group publication titled 'An organisation with a memory' This group was chaired by the CMO Liam Donaldson who was very keen to use the Swiss cheese analogy to explain how events lined up to produce a serious problem. The paper was designed to address and explain how adverse events need to be prevented and it included the usual list of methods but didn't seem to consider how lessons (if ever learned in the first place) can so quickly be forgotten by organisations and may never be passed on reliably to future generations of clinicians. It is true to say that parts of theNHS have even forgottenthe existenceof'An organisation with a memory'. A sort of organisational dementia perhaps?   I'm not sure where an organisational memory evenresides and howitshould exist apart from in written or computer records, both of which gather dust very quickly. Seniors can pass on cautionary tales to successive generations of trainees but stable teams are becoming rarer. Theoretically these lessons should accumulate and be drummed into every practitioner during everyprocedural training but that is not universal.   I suppose that's all a lengthy way of saying that organisations and individuals have to share responsibilities and punishments for repeatingpreventable errors. 'Defensive Medicine' has always been usedas a derogatory term but I increasingly feel sympathy for those who practice it. Even if criminal convictions haven't increased much, the intense publicity has and is in every doctor's face every day.-2n7doaoq5f5c8hsd8a4l5f0c6d8h9mhbxnc6a8gpc9grf9d3ita6b6	Maxim	15/12/2015 6:05 PM	0	0

Equally it took me a while to appreciate that from a managerial viewpoint it was the current implementation that counted - after all the whole aim might change in another direction in the near future. This need to live in the here and now made memory irrelevant.   The potassium really was a sorry saga - ampoules almost identical to NaCl yet with dire consequences in the event of a mix-up. One of our local nurses was struck off for just such an error and I bet there were a number of close calls which went unrecorded.

1326	293	1	John, sken, Maxim,   In some countries criminalisation of medical mistakes is routine. Switzerland is a good example and I believe in Thailand medical error is always criminal. In the UK medical negligence only becomes a crime if the patient dies.  A health care professional can make the most egregious error and yet escape criminal liability if the patient survives. When a patient does die, death could have been caused by many factors frequently making it nigh on impossible to determine whether the suspect was the, or even a substantial, cause of death. To put it crudely one might also say there is an element of luck involved whether an individual Doctor faces criminal charges; the patient may survive although be seriously harmed or some event might supervene to break the chain of causation. 'Medical manslaughter' or, more accurately, Gross negligence manslaughter is an ill defined concept which prosecutors, judges and juries all struggle with. The test for gross negligence manslaughter is an objective one, there need be no evidence of subjective culpability. Such problems have led to calls to raise the bar of liability by, for example, creating a subjective recklessness test or a more substantive test for gross negligence.      For decades in the legal system there has been debate about the place of negligence in criminal liability in general. The classic view is that mala in se (real crimes) require subjective knowledge or intent, and that negligence should be the basis of liability only for mala prohibita (behaviours that are not intrinsically bad). Thus negligence is, according to this argument, an unsuitable basis for liability for serious crimes such as manslaughter.      Others support the imposition of criminal sanctions for those who were negligent on the basis that a defendant could have complied with proper standards of conduct expected of a reasonable Dr but did not do so - this approach does not, in my view, take into account system and process failures and also seems to suggest a deliberate effort not to comply. Legal academics enjoy discussing these legal specifics but frequently fail to realise that it is Doctors practising medicine in less than perfect conditions who have to manage uncertainty and risk who may come a cropper for a minor mishap but suffer emotionally and professionally forever.      Patient groups insist that because the 'Organisation with a Memory'' work was so influential it has had the effect of ensuring blame is never apportioned to individuals when it rightly should be. They say they are weary of press conferences where Trust Director's says 'lessons have been learned' and wider system failures are blamed (I do have some sympathy with their concerns). They point to Mid Staffs as an example where patient care was abysmal and no management figure or senior Dr or Nurse seemed to be held to account.      When trusts operate with so many Agency Nurses and Locums or too few staff it must be clear that the organisational memory just isn't there. No matter how strict and superb policies and procedures are unless staff know them and follow them there isn't much that can be done.      Defensive Medicine is always deemed to be negative. Whilst it pushes up costs (hugely in the US) one can hardly blame Doctors for doing what they can to allay legal problems. The media barrage 'consumers' with adverts implying that every injury or illness is someone's fault and must be compensatable.      There is a movement in the US (the name eludes me at the moment) encouraging Drs not to practise defensively because, they say, it is unethical and erodes the Dr/pt relationship (the focus of clinical practice may shift from the patients well-being to one of legal self-protection for the doctor) and utilisation of scarce healthcare resources for non therapeutic use results in other pts being unable to access healthcare they need promptly. Interestingly Texas has implemented strong tort reform but there is no reduction in defensive practice.      kirked-fw9hwk9nojd27buvvq6i1ktezsp02089hlnaihq3kqn93	kirked	16/12/2015 12:49 PM	0	0

The details below haverecently appearedon theRoyalCollege of Physicianswebsite under 'news'.Intriguingly, it relates to the same case from Bridgendbut no mentionis made of theother nurseswho were convictedfor different reasons (but little mention wasmade in theother media about the acquitted nurses when reporting the convicted ones). I thoughtit was easier to reproduce thewholenewsitem rather than give a link. Plenty of interesting legalpoints in the contrasting wilful neglect verdicts but, one way or another, that hospital doesn't seem to have been a good place for blood sugar measurements by anyone!       ""Two nurses were recently cleared of wilfully neglecting patients in a specialist stroke unit; they had risked going to prison. The problem these two innocent nurses experienced could have happened to anyone in any hospital.      The hospitals computerised blood glucometer records differed from what the nurses had written in the records. It was therefore alleged the two nurses had falsified patient records.  Once the police start exploring the vast amount of electronic records in a hospital, it is almost inevitable they will find problems. It just takes one complaint to start the process, and staff suspensions and arrests then follow with horrible predictability. It took three years of police work to bring this case to trial, and there was a vast amount of evidence, both paper and electronic.  The prosecution believed the computer records were a true and complete record.  The defense argued that the electronic datas integrity and provenance was not reliable; in fact the data had been manipulated. Because there was no auditing in the data trail, showing the data was unreliable was a complex technical process.  The pre-trial review consisted of two weeks of cross-examination of the expert witness and others in order to work through the reliability of the evidence.  In his ruling the judge said that presenting unreliable evidence to the jury would be misleading, and he therefore excluded it. The trial proper then started with the jury present, but the prosecution was unable to submit any evidence. The case collapsed, and the judge directed the jury to deliver a not guilty verdict. The nurses were set free.  There are important lessons for all of us:   If you or a colleague are caught up in an incident, dont automatically assume that computer data is reliable. Check any legal advice you is based on an accurate understanding of computers!  If a hospitals IT system cannot produce data that can stand up in court, is your hospital IT systems reliable and adequate enough for clinical use?  This incident arose around one simple device in an ordinary hospital. What might happen where you are?  How will anyone be able to know when there are problems like this when we have gone paperless and have no paper to fall back on?""-q22fraxrgfvva9cooms9bl8ek4afe3aa2a936085vvtaezu"	Maxim	18/12/2015 7:50 PM	0	0

1329	294	1	Tom   Can you give some more information on a couple of points that might have a bearing onany answer to this interesting question. I don't know much about the details of this procedure.   1) What would the best chance of success be in this procedure and is the 10% primarily because of the HIV infection and any treatment being given for it? Does treatment carry risk to the foetus?   2)I presume that egg harvesting has a small risk to the donorand I wonder if you can tell us that risk.   I doubt that thedonor has any general right to know her sister's HIV status but her altruism might have limits if the risk to herself wasn't seen to be justified by the very low chance ot successful pregnancy for her sister. In that case she might have aclaim to knowthat, for reasons undisclosed, the chance of success was very low.   You mention, in passing, that the sisters 'worship at the same church'. Were you hinting thatthe donor's religious beliefs mighthave a bearing on her decision to donate if she was aware of all the facts.   In summary, I wouldn't think the donor hasan absolute right to information about the recipient's health details and that eggs should probablybe freely given (eg like blood) without other knowledge unless this affected the donor'sjudgement of the level of personal risk that would be acceptable to her. This judgement might well be different according to whether the recipient is a sibling or someone unknown.-601bsbyd5ixb7c5c2m4an4laaw9a6i7d2d8	Maxim	24/11/2015 10:43 AM	0	0

1331	296	1	This case was resolved recently and I thought others might find it interesting. It is a terribly sad case where a very close family suffered disaster following an act of altruism.      Mr A had been undergoing renal dialysis for several years and was on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. His son Mr B (age 35) was anxious to give his father the opportunity of a better quality of life in his well earned retirement by donating his right kidney. This he duly did. However, the operation was carried out negligently - and to a degree recklessly. Proceedings against the surgeon by the GMC were undertaken.      The consequences of the negligent surgery have been catastrophic for Mr B and his family: physically, psychologically, emotionally and financially. Although the patient's right kidney was successfully removed and transplanted, Mr B suffered irreversible failure of the left kidney. In fact he should never have been advised to undergo the operation at all given the grave dangers involved. That negligent advice was compounded by serial mistakes during the operation itself. Mr B's life was saved only after many hours on the operating table during which he received over 100 units of blood and fluid transfusions.      During the course of the operation Mr B suffered a Myocardial Infarction; ischaemic damage to the lumbo-sacral plexus and an Inferior Vena Cava thrombosis. He was left in total renal failure. He was in hospital for nearly two months, during which he started to receive haemodialysis three times a week. He also developed a serious drug induced confusional disorder. This treatment affected him profoundly. He became severely depressed, frequently contemplating suicide. He contracted serious infections, one of which necessitated a further admission to hospital.      Mr B's own act of altruism in donating a kidney to his father, which cost him so dear, was reciprocated by his sister. She donated a kidney to Mr B at very considerable psychological and emotional cost. That operation was successful. It released the claimant from an indefinite regime of dialysis. However, he lives with the constant fear that his body will reject the kidney and it is common ground that when he reaches his early sixties that kidney will require replacement. This uncertainty, and his experiences generally, have left him with an understandable obsession about his health.      Unfortunately a recurrent infection was imported with his sister's kidney - Cytomegalovirus. This is a constant source of worry. He has been advised that his renal failure increases significantly the risk that he will suffer from ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Consequently he adopts a very careful lifestyle and diet. He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels which cause him constant worry. The immuno-suppressant drugs he takes, in particular to control the CMV, greatly increase the risk of his developing other debilitating and life threatening conditions. The consequence is that he has become fastidious to the point of obsessional about personal and general hygiene, which impacts upon the whole family. He can be irritable and overbearing. He is prone to bouts of weeping.      There are further serious physical consequences. The nerve damage suffered during the negligent operation has resulted in altered sensation below the right knee. There is hyper-sensitivity, pain and loss of sensation in various parts of the right foot, and clawing of the first and second toes. He has had surgery on the first toe. Further surgery had been planned to straighten and fuse the toes but this may be avoided by regular injection of botulinum toxin for life. The issue surrounding this problem with his foot has a bearing on his residual earning capacity. Currently he is unable to run, and walking on uneven ground and stairs presents some difficulty.      Mr B has also been much distressed by urinary difficulties. For a time self- catheterisation was attempted. He found it a dreadful experience. Urinary frequency bedevils his daily life, and results in broken nights for him and for his wife. The medication he takes has had unpleasant side-effects including the profuse growth of unwanted body hair, the development of skin acneiform lesions and the deposit of facial and abdominal fat. His inability to exercise has also led to undesirable weight gain. Prior to the operation, the claimant was a healthy, fit and active 35 year old man. He took great pride in his health and fitness, running several kilometres each morning to set himself up for the working day. He had enormous energy. He was cheerful, optimistic and extrovert. Now the picture is very different. At the age of 39 his daily life revolves around his health worries. He is constantly fearful of infection or changes which may increase the risk of the kidney being rejected. Any venturing from the strictly enforced hygiene of the home is fraught with anxiety. He lives with the certain knowledge that the kidney will require replacement by the time he reaches the age of 61 and that this will be preceded by symptoms of progressive renal failure. It is agreed that his life expectancy has been reduced by 10 years.      Mr B is a shadow of his former self. He is lacking in energy. He is exhausted by 9 pm and generally has to be in bed by 10 pm. He is moody and irritable. His marriage, though very strong, is constantly under strain. The children have been affected and distressed by their father's condition and behaviour and he has bridges to build there.      Prior to the transplant Mr B was a very successful and well paid executive on the verge of setting up his own company.      After a long and extremely complex process of financial assessment for damages and estimated projection for future loss of earnings and medical expenses Mr B was awarded the following:            Item Amount                                        Judgment   General damages                                    168,000    Past losses inclusive of interest                          287,500    Future losses (other than earnings and medical expenses)    432,500    Medical expenses & treatment                          167,757    Loss of earnings to the age of 65                        4,580,869    Loss of earnings after the age of 65                      68,891    Deduction for residual earning capacity                [less164,108]    Capital loss of sale of the business                       1,199,237    Total award                                          6,740,646       Kirked-f05o3npb36b8bu4ad01d8cqb23d4uy5bia15aieoiddpbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb1abbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb9bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb3ebbb4bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbba9bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbba4cbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbba4cbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb8cbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbzbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbo119qzcsdyerese3dse5	kirked	3/11/2015 4:05 AM	0	0
1332	296	1	There are 2 separate issues here. Just what happened during the first donation - was this carried out in an appropriate unit and by a suitably accredited surgeon? It sounds as though there were problems from the very beginning - just who assessed Mr B as a suitable donor and how far were they to blame as well as the surgeon ?   The second donation raises a separate issue . Specifically were the protocols for screening +/- treatment for CMV followed ? Generally , should recipients be given an option on whether to receive a kidney ? There are from time to time cases where a malgnancy seems to have been transferred by donation and there are presumably patients where there are additional risks or the donor has some additional risk factors. But should the patient be given the option - particularly an older patient ?   Off-hand I cannot recall a sadder tale of medical disaster following such admirable altruism within a family.   On a legal point , it seems quite likely this chap will not reach 65 : does the award for loss of earnings after the age of 65 have to be returned?-r92	sken	3/11/2015 11:21 AM	0	0
1333	296	1	May I divert to thread a little, if only to avert my gaze from such a disaster?   About twenty-five years ago, I cared for a child, quadraplegic and ventilator dependent after an RTA. She sued the driver for damages, and got a similar sum. Butsome was money paid into a trust, so that it generated the income she needed for care etc. That trust ended when, sad but invitably to say, she died before reaching her twentieth birthday.   I was told at the time that this was a new way of settling damages. It seemed fair to me that she and the family should be compensated properlyfor the damage to their lives, and that the insurance company should not have to support the family beyond the death of thier unfortunate child. I've never heard of another case, but then I haven't been involved with anything similar. Would a portion of this poor man's damages have been paid into a trust?

1334	296	1	John D- I think there have been some other cases similar to the example you give. But it is different when an adult has dependents who may need support beyond the death of the original patient. So one might have to take those and their earning potential into account. The cynic might argue that the lawyers will solve the problem by dividing up whatever is left amongst themselves during endless lawsuits. (There are equally cynical comments made about the medical profession at times).	sken	3/11/2015 3:13 PM	0	0
1335	296	1	Many thanks sken and John,      I hope this is helpful as regards the financial aspects of your questions. Until the late 1980's damages were paid in a lump sum. It did not matter that the compensation was for losses that might be suffered in the future: both the monthly wage that the accident/negligence victim may have lost, and the continuing costs of care that would have to be met, were compensated by one large payment. This could be problematic for the claimant (patient). The responsibility for investing the money wisely is significant. When a defendant agrees a lump sum rather than a periodic payment settlement, they are also offloading considerable financial risk onto the claimant. While the scale of lump sum payments in serious injury cases can make them seem like giant windfalls, they also carry with them a range of financial risks. For example, inflation will gradually erode the value of the payment and returns on lump sum investments may be taxed, while the income paid by an annuity is tax free. These risks can be mitigated with expert financial planning, but the elephant in the room - the mortality risk - cannot. If the claimant lives longer than predicted, there is the very real danger that the money awarded in a lump sum will run out.      A structured settlement usually takes the following form. The defendant's insurer, having agreed a lump sum figure, will arrange to convert part of that sum into a series of periodic payments structured to accommodate the claimants individual needs. To fund the arrangement, the liability insurer purchases annuities from a life office, and assigns the benefit of them to the claimant. However, NHS Trusts may prefer to self fund settlements (see below). The arrangement clearly can be especially advantageous financially if there is dispute about the claimants life expectancy.      Because settlements from trusts ultimately derive from the public purse there are an increasing number of cases where payments made are recouped upon death of the claimant (see http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-22553341 as an example). In Mr B's case if he died earlier than anticipated (which is a very real probability of which the pt is aware) payments would usually stop unless there are dependants reliant upon him - this will usually have been considered in the original settlement.      As an aside, the government has guaranteed these NHS self-funded structures and claimants can be assured that their future payments are copper-bottomed. However, these savings to the NHS do not accrue without risk to public funds. There is a potential problem involved in the NHS acting as if it were a miniature life insurer by accepting continuing, uncertain, liabilities into the future. The National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) handles financial and claims responsibility for cases of clinical negligence. It automatically considers the possibility of a structure in any claim which is likely to exceed 250,000 and a few hundred NHS structures have been put in place to date. The concept is particularly attractive to the NHS. However defendant Trusts can self-fund the continuing payments involved in a structure instead of parting with a lump sum to buy annuities from the insurance market. They can then keep the cash in-house and thus avoid the problems caused by the loss of large capital payments. In the past, the amounts needed for lump sum awards have fluctuated widely, and their payment could have dramatic effects upon health care budgets: major capital expenditure was deferred and even wards closed. Self-funded structures thus make more money available to the NHS in the short term. This is especially attractive to a Government keen to increase the resources immediately available for health care. It is of course debatable whether this really means more resources and services available to patients!      kirked-3o6hucwa55iyqzf8mrnomu0ay35asy8143apja670byz	kirked	4/11/2015 10:10 AM	0	0

1338	296	1	Kirked   The addition of 'recklessly' to the already serious verdict of negligence is intriguing and that implies a whole range of possibilities. Presumably the verdict would have been the same whether or not the donated kidney was from family member and I had a few, purely personal, thoughts on the altruism aspect of this case.   We know nothing about the dynamics within this familywhich, tragically,ended up much worse off as a family than if the father had waited for a kidney but I find it difficult to imagine that I would allow any of my children to put their ownlife at suchsignificant risk if I were in a similar position to the father. Obviously there are lesser degrees of risk donating blood for exampleor even bone marrow but the risks of nephrectomy would be beyond consideration. I stress again that this is purely a personal opinion but I would be interested to read others' views.   Altruism is always a tricky concept. In this family's case I'm sure it was as pure as it gets but there have certainly been concerns about the wider aspects of family donations in the past. I once worked as a lecturer/SR on a large London renal unit and we were asked to work up a living donor transplant where the young family member donor was being flown in from abroad. It didn't take me long to see that the donation was anything but voluntary and informed. I am pleased that my senior colleagues agreed to halt the process. I guess the safeguards are much tighter nowadays but I wonder how much of this still occurs.-s63b8jsa2oma7dwd2d8gpgphod3	Maxim	5/11/2015 9:51 AM	0	0
1339	296	1	"kirked - once again , many thanks. I have kept your explanation for reference. Maxim I don't expect your renal unit was a vast distance from the Blind Beggar ? Did you come across Rod Dathan who I gather has just died. He was one of the first batch of doctors when the renal unit opened at the London. A psychiatric patient jumped from the top floor and landed on the unit roof. Rod made a comment about their knowing they were waiting for a donor , but never expected him to come through the ceiling. .. Perhaps we should have a thread sometime on the use of sick humour by doctors.   In those early days there was considerable screening of patients for dialysis - I became aware of this whilst working on the psychiatric unit , but I have the impression that everyone is a bit more gung-ho these days.   Just what is it that drives some folk to donate a kidney in an apparently totally altruistic way? Presumably different factors may apply for different folk. I doubt whether the dynamics of within family donations can ever be fully unravelled - I too would not want to accept a donation from offspring , nor would I expect my parents to have accepted one from me - but would have felt donation from paret to offspring as pretty natural . Nor would I have had any compunction about being a donor for my wife - or do I just say that because compatibility is less likely ? The domino system clearly has considerable self interest involved.   As I have said previously , I am not in favour of the present system of looking at recipients purely on the grounds of ""medical need"" , nor do I think we should encourage Joe Public to see organ donation (or blood transfusion) as a ""right"" without responsibility. I see that there have been some fairly outspoken views from the transplant world of late suggesting essentially that we should re-visit some of the basic ethical issues of how we should use what is essentially a limited resource and which will remain limited even if an opt out system is adopted.-zn6c74a2nogq"	sken	5/11/2015 12:31 PM	0	0

Posted by sken   Did you 'misspeak' about blood transfusion, Sken? While no one has a right to medical treatment, once a doctor has accepted their duty of care, then transfusion has be considered, and is about the lowest risk transplant (except posssible faecal!).   But I would agree about responsibility. I think that blood donation should be more than a responsibility, it should be a civic duty, along with voting, jury serviceand paying local or national taxes. Only a medical exemption, or possibly 'reasons of concience' backed up by memebship of thr Witnesses and evidence of regular worship at the Kingdom Hall would excuse.

1341	297	1	"12th June 1991  Stu Blue and his wife Pru, (aged 35) got up, had a cigarette and some coffee and Mr Blue left for work at about 7am. On arrival at work (about 7.30am) his wife was already on the phone telling him she felt ill, had chest pain and was very nauseous. He went back home immediately. On arrival his wife was anxious, hot, still had chest pain and having difficulty breathing. Mr Blue called the GP practice. Dr A said he would be there shortly. A little before his arrival an ambulance had been summoned by Mrs Blue's mother. It arrived before the GP.     Dr A arrived at about 8.40 a.m. He was not Mrs Blue's normal general practitioner. Indeed, he had not dealt with her before, although her parents were patients of his. She seemed to be having chest pain. He was unsure what the cause was but decided to admit her to hospital with a possible diagnosis of heart attack. Having made that decision the hospital was bound to admit her (his reasoning). He telephoned the Coronary Care Unit at the Royal Infirmary. He told them that Mrs Blue was having severe chest pain. Normally he would write a letter which would go with the patient in the ambulance but he could not recall if in the urgency of the situation he did so on this occasion. Dr A gave Mrs Blue an injection of nalbuphine. He could not remember whether and to what extent it had been effective. Mrs Blue was taken by ambulance to the Coronary Care Unit. Mr Blue followed in a car. When he saw her on CCU she was still distressed but was no longer in pain - it was now 10.45 a.m. She said she had experienced a queer feeling coming over her with tightening in her chest over the heart and pain in her left arm. Mr Blue stayed with her for about an hour and then left so that her parents could see her. He went home.     On her admission an ecg was immediately recorded. On CCU Dr R had 3 ECGs all timed 8.53am and all he described as normal. Dr R took a history from Mrs Blue which he noted as follows:""Severe central chest pain radiating across chest and into back starting at 8.00 a.m. and lasting about 30 minutes. Not radiating to neck. Some 'heaviness' in arms. Associated breathlessness. Pain no longer present. No previous similar pain. No palpitations.""     He then noted Mrs Blue's previous medical history, family history and social history. The only items of significance from a cardiac point of view were a strong family history on her father's side of ischaemic heart disease and that she smoked 15 cigarettes a day. Dr R then carried out a thorough examination of her. He noted that she was ""anxious ++"". She was very upset and crying when he first saw her. There was no evidence of Myocardial Infarction on the ECG but he asked that it should be repeated in one hour. He also asked for a full blood count, biochemical screening, enzyme tests and a chest x-ray. Dr R was with Mrs Blue for about 30-45 minutes and was noting his findings as he went along. The notes then went on to a trolley in the ward where all such notes were kept.     The repeat ECG was taken shortly after midday. The T-waves in leads V1 and V2 were now inverted and those in V3 flat. Dr R and the Consultant Cardiologist (Dr J) noted the findings but no particular action was taken at that time. On his ward round at about 4.00 p.m. Dr J first saw Mrs Blue. Dr R was with him. So was a member of the nursing staff. Before he saw her he read and considered Dr R's notes of the history and his examination. He was aware of the ECG traces taken at 8.53 a.m. The change in the trace taken at midday had also been drawn to his attention. He regarded it as a slight change which could be due to many causes, only one of which was cardiac disease. He considered that the change was not compatible with acute myocardial infarction. Dr J took a history from Mrs Blue and examined her. When he saw her she was calm and seemed well. Her vital signs - pulse and blood pressure - were normal. She conversed with Dr J in an articulate way. Nothing that Dr J got from his examination was materially different from what Dr R had found in the morning. Dr J came to the view that Mrs Blue's symptoms were not cardiac in origin but were oesophageal. In order, however, to cover the outside chance that there had been a silent myocardial infarction at some earlier time prior to the event which led to Mrs Blue's admission he asked for the enzyme tests which had been done to be checked. He stated 'that such tests, based on a blood sample taken shortly after the patient's admission, could not reveal whether the pain which had led to her admission was due to a myocardial infarction; it was too soon for that. But if the enzyme tests were normal that Mrs Blue could go home'. He prescribed maalox. He noted all this in the hospital records. Dr R telephoned the laboratory to get the results of the enzyme tests. They were normal. Dr R then wrote the discharge note addressed the general practitioner. In it he wrote, inter alia: ""No ECG changes"". The diagnosis was given as oesophageal spasm. A fuller, typed report to the general practitioner, giving more detail, followed later.     Dr R phoned Mr Blue and told him that the problem was not heart related but was an oesophageal spasm. On the way home they went and got the maalox. They got home at about 6.00 p.m. Mr Blue got his wife some tea and made her comfortable. She went to bed early, at about 7.00 p.m. An hour or so later she complained of pain in her chest and he reported this to Dr A by telephone. Dr A told him to let him know if there was any further change. Mrs Blue settled for a while but at about 11.00 p.m. complained again, more strongly this time, of chest pain. Mr Blue telephoned Dr A and told him. Dr A came out and examined her. He told Mr Blue that it might be a few days before the pain disappeared. Shortly thereafter Mr Blue retired to bed. At about 4.30 a.m. his wife woke him complaining again of severe pains in the chest. She said she could not bear it. Mr Blue telephoned Dr A who came out again immediately. By the time he arrived Mrs Blue's condition had worsened. She became hysterical then collapsed without a pulse. Dr A told Mr Blue to call for an ambulance, which he did. In the meantime Dr A started CPR. When the ambulance arrived defibrillation was attempted but without response. Mrs Blue was taken by ambulance to the Accident and Emergency Department in infirmary. From there she was taken to theatre but all attempts at resuscitation failed. She was pronounced dead at 5.50 a.m.      Post mortem examination of the deceased's body revealed the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was severely atheromatous over the proximal 6 cms with 70% occlusion of the lumen and an e-centric plaque. The circumflex branch was also severely atheromatous with up to 90% luminal obliteration. The right coronary artery showed circumferential atheroma with approximately 40% narrowing and 3 cms from the origin there was an area of plaque rupture with associated haemorrhage. Death was due to coronary artery disease. The area of plaque rupture, possibly complicated by overlying thrombus, would have accounted for her presenting symptoms. Mottling found on the myocardium was consistent with a very recent infarction, probably less than 8 hours before death.     Expert medical opinion will follow. The crux of the legal complaint was that it had been negligent to discharge Mrs Blue in light of her presentation, clinical and ECG findings and family history. Further that it was Dr J's duty to keep the deceased in hospital for at least 24 hours, that is, until at least 9.30 a.m. on the following day.

1342	297	1	Kirked   I suspect there will be plenty of responses to this case report and I look forward to any comments from cardiologists. As I find myself with a bit of time I'll volunteer a few provocative comments to kick off.   Although this occurred over twenty years ago I think you could see the same thought processes and decisions being made today. Yes, it's easy to be wise in retrospect but this mistake has been made so many times that you might think the lesson could be available to all but still it happens. Why?   Given that the pain was clearlycompatible with a diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease withtwo strong risk factorsand there were changing ECG signs ( the word 'slight' is one of the most dangerous in Medicine) you wonder what thinking justified discharge that same day. Even today there's often a misunderstanding that normal levels of troponins exclude a serious ischaemic process when they do no such thing.   You could identify several cognitive errors but Isuspect one of the most commoncauses for premature and unsafedischarge is thedemand tofree bedsfor other admissions who are often less ill than those being discharged. Those who pressurise clinicians to make rash decisions are never the ones to appear in court.   Whether this was called negligence was a legal decision but the real shame is that such cases don't result in prevention across the board.

1343	297	1	Many thanks Maxim for your thoughts. Your comments about freeing up beds is absolutely correct in this case.   Plaintiff expert medical opinion - Dr Moon Key points:      He noted Dr R's examination of the deceased that there was a strong family history on her father's side of ischaemic heart disease and that she was a smoker. These factors increased the likelihood of coronary heart disease even in the case of a woman aged 35, who was basically in a very low probability category for such disease.      Dr Moon thought, however, that the symptoms recorded by Dr R were much more likely to have a cardiac origin than oesophageal, although he accepted that they could be the latter.      The normal ECGs at 8.53 a.m. did not exclude the possibility that a myocardial infarction had occurred at home that morning, and a further ECG in one hour would not do so either. It took longer for ECG changes to evolve. His practice would be to take a further ECG 24 hours later. It was, however, reasonable practice to repeat the ECG at midday, as had been done.      The changes from the ecg(s) taken at 8.53 a.m. were not diagnostic of heart attack but they did increase the likelihood that the deceased's chest pain was cardiac in origin. They made it more likely that the deceased was suffering from an acute coronary syndrome. Continued observation and further evaluation were therefore required.      The the correct practice in 1991 was to test a small range of enzymes (LDH & AAT) in order to diagnose whether a myocardial infarction had occurred. These enzymes are released from the heart muscle, but only slowly, and are not seen at relevant levels for a number of hours after the suspected myocardial infarction, a minimum of 8 hours but nearer to 12 hours. Therefore the blood sample which enables the enzymes to be tested should not be taken until that period has elapsed, in this case until at earliest the late afternoon on 12 June.      It was appropriate for Dr J to order enzyme tests to be done and if they were normal, for the deceased to be discharged, but it was inappropriate to base the tests on a blood sample taken at 9.30 that morning. Of the two enzymes tested AAT shows a raised level earlier and reduces to a normal level earlier. LDH takes longer to show a raised level and remains high for longer.      Nevertheless Dr Moon accepted that, although a wrong diagnosis was in fact made in this case, the probability that someone such as the deceased who presents with chest pain but has a normal ECG has actually had a heart attack is low.      Second expert plaintiff opinion - Dr Woods Key points:      The pt was displaying some of the classic symptoms of a cardiac problem and the possibility was that she had had a heart attack. Oesophageal pain can be almost identical in its symptoms to cardiac pain. However, you cannot prove oesophageal pain and so he said that he would treat her as if she had had a heart attack until he had excluded it.      He would have admitted her, doing serial ECGs and enzyme level tests. The steps that Dr R took after examining her were appropriate. In particular, it was appropriate to order a later ECG. A normal ECG on admission would not exclude a heart attack but if it had happened, it would show on later ECGs.      The deceased should not have been discharged home on the basis of her chest pain having settled by the time of her admission and the ECGs taken at about that time being normal. That would not have been reasonable, because by that time there was no evidence that her pain was not cardiac in origin. It was essential to do serial ECGs. It would have been negligent not to have done the second ECG, the one done at about midday. Dr Woods accepted that, as a 35 year old woman, the deceased was in a very low risk category for a heart attack and he accepted that chest pain is a common medical emergency.      With symptoms which were text book of cardiac pain, albeit of oesophageal pain also, no patient should be discharged until cardiac pain had been excluded. This meant that a large number of patients had to be kept in hospital overnight, although not necessarily in the Coronary Care Unit. With advances since 1991, however, enzymes which peak earlier are used for these tests now and so it is possible to turn patients around more quickly.      The changes in the T-waves on leads V1, V2 and V3 on the ECG trace taken at midday represented a definite change. They were not diagnostic of a cardiac problem but were not due to postural changes on the part of the patient or the positioning of the leads. They could have been due to other non-cardiac causes but on balance would have reinforced his inclination that the problem was cardiac. In any event, there was enough to warrant looking at the matter further. He would therefore have done further ECGs.      The changes in the ECG at midday would have made him more interested in the enzyme levels. Since the AAT enzyme would peak at 12-24 hours after any heart attack (sooner than LDH), that would mean that it should be measured from a blood sample taken not less than 12 hours after the suspected heart attack. That would have meant that the deceased should have been kept in hospital until at least 8.00 p.m. on 12 June for the blood sample to be taken and then some time after that to await the result. The deceased should not have been sent home before the results of these enzyme tests were known.      He was highly critical of Dr J's decision to send her home when he did. He interpreted Dr J's diagnosis of oesophageal spasm as implying that he had excluded a cardiac cause of the problem. But in his view it certainly had not been excluded. If Dr J had seen the trace of the ECG done at midday he had either failed to observe the change or missed its significance.

1344	297	1	Plaintiff witness Dr J (treating Consultant) Key points:      His hospital is a large busy hospital and is the Regional Cardio-thoracic Centre for some 650,000 people. It serves a large geographical area in respect of serious heart disease and is the only one in the area to do so. In 1991 there were only 11 beds for acute cardiology patients in the CCU. There were a further 34 beds for chronic cardiology patients. There was always pressure on these beds. The system which operated in 1991 was not to have all these acute beds occupied all the time because space had to be kept for the admission of new acute patients. Nor was it possible to admit all patients with chest pain. The frequency of chest pain was too great to allow that.      Symptoms had to be stratified in such a way to decide which patients should be admitted to the CCU and which not. That is because the decision to admit initially was the general practitioner's and the hospital had no choice in the matter at that stage.      Dr J accepted that occasionally wrong decisions were made in deciding which patients to keep in hospital but the published results showed that 95% of them were correct. With regard to the deceased he remembered the situation clearly. That was because he was shocked when she died and he had looked back over what had taken place. He had seen the deceased once. While he was heavily committed during the day with other duties he was always available if necessary but there had been no request for his attendance before his ward round. He also saw and considered the ECG traces taken on admission and at midday. He recognised that there was a change in the latter. These, however, were slight in his view and could be due to many causes, only one of which was cardiac disease. They were not compatible with acute myocardial infarction.      It was true that they increased the likelihood of a cardiac event taking place but that was heavily outweighed by the fact that a woman of the deceased's age was so unlikely to have coronary disease. All this took place before Dr J examined the deceased. He then saw the patient. He took a history from her and examined her. At that time she was no more concerned than most people in her situation and she seemed well. She conversed with him in an articulate way. Her vital signs - pulse and blood pressure - were normal.      Dr J said that if he had thought there was a likelihood of the deceased having cardiac disease, he would not have discharged her at that time. He was at complete variance with the view expressed that the deceased should not have been discharged until a cardiac origin for her chest pain had been excluded, if by that was meant exclusion by serial ECGs and enzyme tests.      He said one had to take account of available capacity in the hospital. It was different from other big cities where there was more than one hospital in the area with a coronary care unit. In his hospital if the patient was very unlikely to have a cardiac problem, the case could not be managed on the basis that that unlikely event might materialise.      There must be regard to available resources. Socio-economic factors had also to be taken into account, particularly when in most cases it would be wholly unnecessary to keep the patient in hospital. In any event, in his own mind and using his clinical judgment he thought he had excluded a cardiac origin for the pain.      It was impractical to admit or keep in hospital all patients with chest pain who have a low probability of coronary artery disease as a cause of their symptoms.      He said that expert witnesses now had the benefit of hindsight which of course he did not have. He also made the point that experts did not see the deceased in the Coronary Care Unit and so had not been able to bring his clinical judgment to bear. Dr J thought that was crucial, adding that otherwise one would practice medicine by telephone or e-mail.

1345	297	1	"Final expert evidence - Professor Foot INDEPENDENT      He explained that his hospital is large with some 900 beds. It receives patients both from its local area and also from elsewhere in the country and on occasions from abroad. He doubted that there was a ""normal"" practice in 1991 as to whether patients with chest pain should be admitted and kept in hospital. It was impractical to admit and keep in hospital all such patients. For example, at his hospital about 6,000 patients per annum present with suspected cardiac pain. It would be impossible to retain them all in hospital. It was necessary, therefore, to decide who was likely in fact to have cardiac pain.      In 1991 there were three publications which reported that half of all hospital presentations with chest pain were not admitted. Given the deceased's age and gender she was at low risk of cardiac problems. A strong family history of ischaemic heart disease and smoking were risk factors but were not very specific. About 40% would give a similar family history and in 1991 a third of women of that age were smokers. But a large number of people with a similar history would not go on to have a heart attack.      Professor Foot thought that it was extremely unlikely that the deceased had had a heart attack on the morning of 12 June. It was very unusual for a person to have a heart attack and at the same time to have remitting pain and a normal ECG. Moreover, there was no history of sweating, no pallor, the pulse was not substantially elevated and blood pressure was normal. There was also no history of pain on exertion. That was unusual in a person who had underlying heart disease.      We now know that the deceased did in fact have extensive heart disease and in retrospect he thought that what the deceased had that morning was unstable angina, although the symptoms were the same as for pain of a non-cardiac origin.      Not only was he of the view that the deceased's symptoms indicated that it was unlikely that she had had a heart attack on the morning of 12 June, but the fact that the ECG was normal on admission and the chest pain was resolving argued strongly against an evolving heart attack. They did not exclude it but made it highly unlikely.      Only 2-3% of those who had an evolving heart attack would have an entirely normal initial ECG. He agreed that it would not have been unreasonable to consider discharging the deceased at that stage. He added that in North America, where there are greater resources, more patients would be retained but a significant proportion would still be sent home. With regard to Dr Woods view that the patient should be kept in hospital until a cardiac origin for the chest pain had been scientifically excluded, that is, for about 24 hours, he said that that was a statement of the ideal but was not consistent with United Kingdom practice.      Although there were changes in the T-waves in three of the leads, they were not diagnostic of a cardiac condition. They could be due to that but could be due other causes. They were non-specific. They are part of the evidence which consisted of all investigations performed and the clinical assessment. The latter was the most important element. He did not agree with Dr Moon's view that it would have been normal practice in light of the changes in the ECG to have monitored the deceased in the Coronary Care Unit as well as repeating the ECGs and the enzyme tests. That, he thought, was a statement of the ideal but in 1991 it was common for people showing inversion of the T-waves to be discharged from hospital after having presented with chest pain. He was therefore of the view that Dr J was not negligent in discharging the deceased when he did.

1348	297	1	Kirked   Im interested to see more discussion of this case because of generic lessons and because it exemplifies specific problems of managing patients with perhaps the trickiest type of acute coronary syndrome. No tissue infarction has yet occurred because the coronary artery has not yet completely occluded but may well do so soon if not treated quickly.   Whilst many aspects of management of ST elevation infarction have improved hugely in the 24 years since your case, many problems remain for similar patients to the one discussed. I would say first that none of my comments represent throwing stones as one correspondent remarked about an earlier case. Rather that, the greatest importance of these cases is not whether or not the court decides about something called negligence but why things go wrong and what might prevent similar mistakes by others. There seem to be three processes that lead to error.     Clinical reasoning: The first challenge with acute chest pain is to decide, clinically, whether the pain is caused by myocardial ischaemia or whether there are positive features to suggest other causes. Here there were clearly symptoms that suggested a high probability for myocardial ischaemia and they convinced the clinicians to take the right initial steps in management. Having decided, reasonably, that myocardial infarction had not occurred, the reasoning process then seemed to go awry. The thinking then changed to there being a low probability of ischaemic heart disease and yet nothing had changed this probability, only that it hadnt yet caused infarction. Suddenly deciding that the pain was due to oesophageal spasm has no justification other than the need to put something on the discharge note.       External factors: The intense pressures to free beds can cause clinicians to reason in different ways and to assess risk differently, even though they usually dont know whether the next patient competing for the bed will have greater or lesser need. Here there were known to be inadequate numbers of beds and clinicians should not to be bullied into accepting policies that could be dangerous. Clinicians may not be able to force better decisions but not, at least, to register concerns can mean that those who should later accept responsibility for harm can claim clinicians agreed with the policy.       Guidelines: While good guidelines can have great value they are too often ineffective or worse because of their poor presentation and the ways in which they are misunderstood or misused. Im not sure what guidelines for NSTEMI patients were in use at that hospital at that time. The challenge is to decide which patients should undergo urgent cardiac catheterisation and which could go home without that investigation. Adam Timmis has just recently written a helpful BMJ article on managing patients with acute coronary syndrome. The decision about urgent catheterisation in NSTEMI patients now depends on the GRACE score which purports to tell the risk of death within the next six months. We dont have precise data to calculate the risk for this patient but its likely she would have shown below the 3% threshold for intervention (yet she died). Some of the rapid responses mention some specific problems with this calculator. My additional concern is that clinical experience/intuition/judgement (mindlines) shouldnt be thrown aside if guidelines dont seem right for a particular context.-133ga36bvg6bwmrgxe1hvfua6uwa6j8ioa9oqd1gte8gng7cu51775m53ab2bilmdu3a64arcymrxonxc3c0oja9a675fgt	Maxim	26/10/2015 10:30 PM	0	0

1351	298	1	I have a long-standing objection to racial prejudice. I see that UK university applications are to remove names from some initial applications. This takes me back about 30 years when those wishing to have a facade of political correctness arranged to have race , age and gender taken off application forms from those applying for junior doctor posts . My suggestion that one would need to remove names as well was met with gentle ridicule. Sitting on appointments committees one was well aware of major prejudices and I recall 1 really excellent doctor wih a foreign sounding married name whose applications met with an almost zero response until she reverted to using her very English maiden name. That solved the problem overnight. Other high flyers chose to emigrate knowing that top UK jobs were unlikely to be available on an unequal playing field.   I wonder just how far we have improved - the approach being adopted by the universities suggests prejudice is rife. A harder question is to know just why this prejudice continues. There can be many reasons some of which are partially rational but others can only be put down to simple prejudice.   And can bias be a problem in another direction ? I recall a comment made that I was not Jewish , Catholic or a Mason but still got some good jobs - so was either good at my subject or acceptable to all parties as a compromise......-df1	sken	27/10/2015 7:34 PM	0	0

The Doctor called me into the room and I explained my problem, was examined and treatment prescribed and I left perfectly content but when I looked at the px it said Nurse Practitioner. I had assumed I was conversing with a Doctor and at no point did the NP say she was a Nurse. Essentially I was led to believe I was seeing a Doctor. In my view it would be professional to have greeted me (and any other patient) with who she was at the outset.   Does it matter? As a Doctor would you prefer to be seen by a GP? Am I making a fuss over nothing?   Nurse practitioners and Paramedics are being aggressively recruited around the country for out of hours services due to the difficulties and expense of recruiting Doctors.   kirked	kirked	8/10/2015 3:06 PM	0	0

1360	300	1	Kirked,   No need to be concerned!  The same mistake has been made by some of the greatest in the land.   Also, Mr Gove, the Minister for Justice, when he injured his ankle recently. He went to a 'walk-in' clinic at the weekend, and was treated, and then complained in Parliament that he hadn't had an X-ray and hdn't been seen by a doctor. When the clinic was 'nurse-led', and used well-known protocols to determine which ankle injuries did need an X-ray.   John-ifm2ku	John D	9/10/2015 8:12 PM	0	0
1361	300	1	Ideally one would see a Doctor or nurse or other health care worker who was competent in their role and relatively humane in their manner.   I note the minister was not complaining about having effective care.The doctor would obviously been better able to tell him to P... off and stop wasting his (or her ) time, maybe run back to Parliament and start saying something useful for a change perhaps?   If we start needing to wear uniforms ie extra stripes for doctors, gold braid for consultants or anybody else who felt particularly insecure generally  we will then start insisting patients have badges then stars to identify themselves. ( Somatisers  get extra badges for extra effort perhaps?) Ideally we should just all be clean-certainly nurses and ideally most doctors too.-mnu8d3eznoba3h5	rcdeacon	10/10/2015 7:41 PM	0	0

1364	301	1	Duane- many thanks but i think many of us feel there is a difference between using an assisted death for the terminally ill as part of palliative care and laws that may allow gun crime and shooting schoolchildren. Gawande's book emphasised - along with others and surveys - how far the USA lags behind in care of the dying. It is this together with some of the real poverty and ensuing poor access to optimal healthcare that exists in California that made even me , a lifelong supporter of assisted dying , have grave misgivings about this new law. Equally , there is a dilemma for those with deep seated religious beliefs , but in a position of authority (whether medical or political) . I thought it positive that the Governor did not just use his religion to opt out.   I have also had almost lifelong respect for Mahatma Gandhi who was very much against killing , yet even he could see that there was a place for shortening life if there was no other way of ending the suffering of a dying person and this shortening was part of medical treatment.	sken	9/10/2015 11:29 AM	0	0
1365	301	1	Sken,   I assure you, I agree with your assertion that there is a place for assisted Death, I see the need in the worst cases, and I understand the premise. I agree with your views on Ghandi too, and I study his writings with great respect.  Now as to the Laws that allow killing of school children, Here is the truth,  what allows killing of innocent school children is not lax gun laws, but rather the same lax laws politicians posiut instead of tougher laws. IE - GUN FREE ZONES, of course criminals who are cowards always attack schools because there is no guns there, and they go for the easy kill!  In america we guard our Money - Brinks trucks with armed guards and we guard everything except our kids, kind of stupid huh?  As a Cop, I have seen murderers do 5 years then get set free, this is where we need tougher laws and judges with some sense of toughness and reality. Stop releasing killers from jail! That is the solution, not more stupid laws no one will enforce....      DuaneF-p8z6c5cueyd9g1foeual6c6e8az	DuaneF	9/10/2015 1:12 PM	0	0

1370	302	1	"Following trials in several parts of the country (UK) Polygraphs (Lie Detectors) will now be used to monitor offenders who have abused children. The belief is that their use is beneficial in assessing whether the offender has re-offended or is likely to. Whilst I am all for proper monitoring of such individuals I am concerned because there is no solid scientific evidence that Polygraphs work at all.      Polygraphs measure arousal, which can be caused by anxiety, anxiety disorders such as PTSD, nervousness, fear, confusion, hypoglycaemia, psychosis, depression, substance induced (nicotine, stimulants), substance withdrawal state (alcohol withdrawal) or other emotions; polygraphs do not measure ""lies."" A polygraph cannot differentiate anxiety caused by dishonesty and anxiety caused by something else.      Because there is no pattern of arousal that is unique to deception, the decision to classify a set of responses as untruthful is inevitably a leap from the shaky ground of ambiguous data into the fog of inference. As a result, techniques to ""beat"" a polygraph are simple and effective. The simplest strategy seems to be to increase arousal during the control questions, rather than trying to reduce arousal during deception, to eliminate any difference.      Polygraphy is widely criticized. Despite claims of 90% validity by polygraph advocates, the National Research Council has found no evidence of effectiveness. The utility among sex offenders is also poor with insufficient evidence to support accuracy or improved outcomes in this population.      Even using the high estimates of the polygraph's accuracy, false positives occur, and these people suffer the consequences of ""failing"" the polygraph. In the 1998 Supreme Court case, United States v. Scheffer, the majority stated that ""There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable"" and ""Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the jurors' knowledge, such as the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, or DNA found at a crime scene, a polygraph expert can supply the jury only with another opinion..."".      The accuracy of the polygraph has been contested almost since the introduction of the device. In 2003, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report entitled ""The Polygraph and Lie Detection"". The NAS found that the majority of polygraph research was ""unreliable, unscientific and biased"", concluding that 57 of the approximately 80 research studies that the American Polygraph Association relies on to come to their conclusions were significantly flawed. These studies did show that specific-incident polygraph testing, in a person untrained in counter-measures, could discern the truth at ""a level greater than chance, yet short of perfection"". However, due to several flaws, the levels of accuracy shown in these studies ""are almost certainly higher than actual polygraph accuracy of specific-incident testing in the field"".      Polygraphy Tests are very common in the US with police departments but are not admissible in court in many States (with some specific exceptions).      I am interested in what medics here think about this. Do you think measuring fleeting changes in BP, Pulse, Respirations and sweating are reliable physiological proxies reflecting dishonesty?      If you were accused of a crime would you be willing to take a Polygraph test?      Kirked      Ps. It is also interesting that many Soviet Spies have passed the polygraph repeatedly - Aldrich Ames comes to mind.      PPS.The Green River Killer, Gary Leon Ridgeway, pled guilty to murdering 48 women in the Seattle area over a twenty-year period. Ridgeway was given a polygraph following the murder of his fourth victim and passed the polygraph exam. He was then dropped as a suspect and went on to kill another 44 women. He is listed as the most prolific killer in U.S. history.-ng6h5njp0j0t70ada3md1r7cm6jh3ur"	kirked	3/10/2015 1:58 PM	0	0
1371	302	1	Kirked,   As a side note, Although polygraphs are widely used, and seemingly trusted in the USA, they are relatively easy to fool!  Many, Many Techniques exist to overcome the polygraph, and the reliability seems flawed from the outset, since the data is interpreted by an examiner, who in most cases is a Police officer, trained in the use of a machine, which is not anywhere near 100% accurate!

1372	302	1	As you say, kirked, the polygraph 'measures' arousal, by lying or possibly by being shown images likely to arouse a paedophile?  Would perverted sexual arousal be more difficult to mask than lying arousal?  These people are unable to suppress thier 'unusual' sexual preferences - perhaps they will be unable to use the many techniques that fool the Polygraph either.

1373	302	1	"Actually John,      Here is what a polygraph measures, : -      The Polygraph Machine      The polygraph instrument has undergone a dramatic change in the last decade. For many years, polygraphs were those instruments that you see in the movies with little needles scribbling lines on a single strip of scrolling paper. These are called analog polygraphs. Today, most polygraph tests are administered with digital equipment. The scrolling paper has been replaced with sophisticated algorithms and computer monitors.        The basic components of a lie detector system    When you sit down in the chair for a polygraph exam, several tubes and wires are connected to your body in specific locations to monitor your physiological activities. Deceptive behavior is supposed to trigger certain physiological changes that can be detected by a polygraph and a trained examiner, who is sometimes called a forensic psychophysiologist (FP). This examiner is looking for the amount of fluctuation in certain physiological activities. Here's a list of physiological activities that are monitored by the polygraph and how they are monitored:   Respiratory rate - Two pneumographs, rubber tubes filled with air, are placed around the test subject's chest and abdomen. When the chest or abdominal muscles expand, the air inside the tubes is displaced. In an analog polygraph, the displaced air acts on a bellows, an accordion-like device that contracts when the tubes expand. This bellows is attached to a mechanical arm, which is connected to an ink-filled pen that makes marks on the scrolling paper when the subject takes a breath. A digital polygraph also uses the pneumographs, but employs transducers to convert the energy of the displaced air into electronic signals.            Blood pressure/heart rate - A blood-pressure cuff is placed around the subject's upper arm. Tubing runs from the cuff to the polygraph. As blood pumps through the arm it makes sound; the changes in pressure caused by the sound displace the air in the tubes, which are connected to a bellows, which moves the pen. Again, in digital polygraphs, these signals are converted into electrical signals by transducers.            Galvanic skin resistance (GSR) - This is also called electro-dermal activity, and is basically a measure of the sweat on your fingertips. The finger tips are one of the most porous areas on the body and so are a good place to look for sweat. The idea is that we sweat more when we are placed under stress. Fingerplates, called galvanometers, are attached to two of the subject's fingers. These plates measure the skin's ability to conduct electricity. When the skin is hydrated (as with sweat), it conducts electricity much more easily than when it is dry.       Some polygraphs also record arm and leg movements. As the examiner asks questions, signals from the sensors connected to your body are recorded on a single strip of moving paper. You will learn more about the examiner and the test itself later.    Detractors of the polygraph call lie detection a voodoo science, saying that polygraphs are no more accurate at detecting lies than the flip of a coin. ""Despite claims of 'lie detector' examiners, there is no machine that can detect lies,"" reads a statement from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). ""The 'lie detector' does not measure truth-telling; it measures changes in blood pressure, breath rate and perspiration rate, but those physiological changes can be triggered by a wide range of emotions.""    Lee, who has been performing polygraph exams for 18 years, agrees that polygraphs do not detect lies. ""What has happened over the years is that the media has dubbed this lie detection, and that's what's clicked, but from a scientific perspective, absolutely not. There's no such thing as lie detection. I couldn't tell you what a lie looks like.""    He does assert that polygraphs can detect deceptive behavior even through the stress brought on by the exam itself. ""If the (forensic psychophysiologist) is properly trained and has the experience, he can penetrate that. Through the specific procedure that the FP will employ, anxiety will not penetrate into it.""    You might be referring to a   http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/penile-plethysmography-controversy-sex-offenders-article-1.2181079   In any event,   While in Law Enforcement I took training to become a Polygraph examiner, and upon Graduation I refused to ever give an exam, Based upon my Moral, and Scientific belief that the science holds as much promise as Homeopathy, IE - ZERO!!   Simply stated the machine does not tell if your lying, rather that your nervous, which might, and could be be for any number of reasons!

1374	302	1	Duane,   I'm not so naive as to think that the standard polygraph 'measures' sexual arousal directly, by penile enlargement or some such.  Instead, it could use the standard parameters that it does measure, which are those of 'arousal', stress, which may have many causes. In fact, I'm sure I read somewhere that one technique to flummox the machine and its operators is to indulge in erotic daydreams during the preliminary 'control' questions.   My point, which perhaps I didn't make clear, was that there may be a place for this in monitoring the progress of desensitising (?correct word?) or re-educating sex offenders. To use eit to screen for, or to implicate suspects would be, as you have pointed out, so scientifically suspect as to be invalid.   This idea may have 'legs' - this article used a polygraph as one limb of a biofeedback system to re-educate patients with an overactive bladder:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Polygraph+re-education   John-zqzb8kvpnexep	John D	4/10/2015 4:36 PM	0	0
1375	302	1	John,      No your not Naive, I never thought that, I do see your point in the possible use for training and or education of sex offenders, If, and only if the machines become more accurate, and of course the science is proven. I do not think it is nowhere near being proven, and I hold a Certificate for polygraph training, and in fact I think it is near in scope to Homeopathy. The science is just not solid. I believe MRI brain scans will eventually be able to tell if a person is lying, once we map the brains higher functions, and can correlate the data.

1378	303	1	Miss Z, aged 52 was a part time GP. She consulted her own GP regarding hot facial flushes, night sweats. palpitations, irritability and mood swings. She suspected it was the Menopause and her GP agreed. The GP did not carry out any physical examination or check any vital parameters. She was started on HRT and did not need to consult the GP again for about 8 months - she automatically requested refills of prescriptions as needed. When she did return to her GP she explained that the symptoms were better since being on HRT but not eradicated. She also stated that over the last few weeks she had periodical intense headaches and anxiety which seemed to coincide with the hot flushes.      The GP changed the medication regime slightly and advised her to return if symptoms did not settle and they might consider other options. A week after seeing her Miss Z was taken unwell whilst at work. She explained to the Paramedics what treatment she was on (HRT only) and that she had noted her BP was high on several occasions (using her own sphygmomanometer) when she was flushed. Her BP on assessment in A&E by an SpR noted a BP of 190/115 but other parameters were all normal.      Twenty four hours after admission to hospital her BP was fluctuating between 190/115 and 210/110 but all other Parameters were considered within normal ranges. On day 3 of admission she suffered a severe haemorrhagic stroke which required intensive nursing and physiotherapy to achieve even a minimal level of independence.      It subsequently transpired she had Phaeochromocytoma which would have explained several of her symptoms. Miss Z felt very let down by her GP and hospital Doctor whom she felt should have considered Phaeo and might, therefore have prevented the stroke.      She sued her GP and the hospital.

This scenario was related to me a few days ago by a colleague from the country concerned - he was a lawyer in the case.  My colleague did say however, that the GP patient was distressed because she didn't speak up more about what the hospital Doctors might have in their minds' as possible problems she had and what options were open to them investigate.  i would have been curious to know if being a Doctor and patient made matters better or worse for her? Or was she treated as any other patient might be? Unfortunately I cannot offer any more medical factors to the case as they are not available to me.

1382	303	1	From personal experience, kirked I know that being a doctor or in a doctor's family can lead to different treatment, not necessary in your favour. For instance, a consultant retaining your notes intending to expedite admission but nothing being done because the secretary had no notes!   In this case, perhaps the receiving hospital doctors did not felel able to institute treatment for a doctor until the consultant had seen them.

1383	303	1	I think menopause was a reasonable first differential (and who knows, she may have been menopasual as well as having a phaeo) - but not doing a BP check before starting HRT strikes me as indefensible.	Pat Harkin	29/9/2015 2:33 PM	1	0
1384	303	1	Kirked   Like John D andPat HarkinI think it's indefensible not to measure blood pressure before prescribing hormone replacement therapy (in any country) and odd that nothing much sounds to have been done diagnostically even after admission. Doctors as patients can affect care in different ways. It doesnt sound as if the right diagnosis occurred to the patient and her suggestion of the menopause as a diagnosis might have been accepted too easily.   Looking more closely at what lessons this case might offer, I will admit a slight interest in phaeochromocytomas. In training I spent several years on a unit where blood pressure was a major interest. As a consultant physician (not with particular BP interest) I diagnosed four patients with phaeos in time to allow successful surgery and saw one other patient, a very young man, who presented in extremis with acute heart failure secondary to extensive subendocardial infarction and who died before the diagnostic biochemical tests returned. This is an unusual number of patients for one consultant to see in a working lifetime but I dont know how much was chance and how much increased awareness.   When a rare diagnosis is missed and legal proceedings occur I guess the Bolam principle is a consideration. Unfortunately we often dont know what a body of our peers would do (as opposed to what they might say in retrospect) in any given circumstances. Most expert witnesses probably dont constitute typical peers. The general argument sometimes put forward in defence is that most doctors might never see more than one phaeo (or other rare condition) in a working lifetime. How many are missed is another question and I think most phaeos are still diagnosed post-mortem.   The point about rarity and recognition is understandable but problematic. It might suggest that we could never be expected to diagnose conditions we have never seen but that would be ridiculous. There are many rare diseases or those occurring in very unusual contexts that defy the best clinicians but rare things do occur and missing some can be fatal. Any diagnosis is easy once youve thought of it. The challenge in clinical reasoning (a subject still formally taught in only a very few medical schools) is to give yourself the best chance to think of it.    The process of diagnosis involves comparing the illness script with the usual scripts of the most important candidate conditions (not just the first one to come to mind). Distinctive clusters of symptoms can act as mental prompts. The combination of headaches, sweating and palpitations in attacks is highly suggestive of phaeo even if the blood pressure is unremarkable outside attacks. Many patients also report funny turns or odd feelings that can defy explanation. Flushing is actually not that common. Perhaps the most important single technique to avoid missing things is, when you think you have the diagnosis, to ask could this be anything else?   As youve shown us, the legal discussions in these cases are often very searching and its a shame when valuable lessons learned dont link back into mandatory learning for others (as weve discussed with civil aviation). The defence society journals do this quite well but I suspect the lessons are read only by a minority of doctors.-ow9flaka6x1j5ctr8i7eqc3t8d2gxb1kba8o8bwja5fub52a776582gw7awuvnr3a2c59aggyfye2yufnr3h1czb3c080eyl	Maxim	29/9/2015 3:33 PM	0	0

1387	303	1	In the UK also there is a real risk of many rarer diagnoses being missed in general practice and hospitals. Some diagnoses require time for a decent history and time for the clinician to think and reflect. Clinicians don't have this time and so diagnoses frequently seem to get dumbed down to the 'most likey' without any consideration of a differential. Increasing use of NPs and HCAs may (or may not) exacerbate this - without a medical degree how can rare things be considered?   There are well documented examples of persistent late diagnoses for unusual conditions such as MS and SLE for these reasons.   In this case obviously the BP should have been measured and this makes it indefensible. But it's possible it may have been normal/high normal at the time of measurement. The clues were in the history but it would have taken time and an interest to elicit them.	rayhope	3/10/2015 8:15 AM	0	0

Traditional British upbringing is to clear your plate, but if you listen to your body you might find you're full before the plate is empty. It's not rude to leave a bit on the plate, and keep this in mind when you portionup tomorrow's meal.    And dropping the alcohol (you'd be amazed how many calories are in a large glass of wine)    Other ones I've heard of include drinking a glass of water before your meal (to fill your stomach) but I never got on well with that, as we tend eat late and then I'm up all night peeing!-bh	DrS	20/8/2015 2:32 PM	0	0
1403	307	1	Thanks for this new thread John. I put comments about weight loss on the e-cigarette thread because both losing weight and stopping smoking (I admit I've never been a smoker)primarily involve determination and the need to avoid fooling oneself. Other addictions such as to opiates or alcohol are very different because unplanned or unsupervised cessation can be life threatening. This is not the case with sensible restriction of food or for smoking cessation. To answer Sken's question 'was it worth it for me?' the answer is unquestionably yes. To be honest I was only looking to use a few pounds but the principles and strategy are probably the same for any amount. My own approach is based on (a)my pastwork in gastroenterology with an interest in metabolic problems (b) personal experience of what works.   1) Be brutally honest. Whatever the 'flat-earthers'claim, the key is net energy balance. Do not fool yourself wittingly or unwittingly about how much you eat.   2) Set a target and be sensible about the time course. One pound loss a week is enough (sustained,that could lead to three and a half stone loss inoneyear)   3) The debate about sugar vs fat will run and run. I'm more in the sugar camp but total calories are the important thing eventually. It's not usually abinary choice. I agree, John, that biscuits can be a problem.   4) The mirror and spouse's comments can be useful modifiers but use measurements rather than guesswork.. Weight and abdominal circumference are applicable at home.   5) I enjoy exercise and know it helps mein many ways but there are 9 kiloCals metabolic energyin a pound of fatand that is a long time on the cross-trainer! Diabetes MD has just given a very helpful update on the role of exercise and I would add just a couple of points. The effects of exercise on metabolic rate can persist after the session and it can beimportant to add resistance exercise to replace fat with lean tissue to help this.   6) Don't give up! The whole science of weight loss has been summed up in two words: 'eat less'. If that's not working, add a third word, 'eat less still'. You don't have to stop all the enjoyable things and smaller amounts ofbetter wine or older malt whisky are better than what we used to guzzle when younger!   Incidentally Sken, the gold price is still far too low to contemplate moving to Kuwait.-fs5dmfyc7gpda0g1f6ah1k3a1b5e9b4bxcdk2c4etao6c6fycc0b6cr9bxhxd0esdxc0	Maxim	20/8/2015 2:57 PM	0	0

1407	307	1	Sounds as though it is a bit late for you lot , but seems to be lots of good advice out there. The invaluable advice given out by Prof Garrow who had a particular interest in obesity was simply weigh yourself and if it is going up then eat less or exercise more. It is just so much easier to avoid putting the weight on than it is to lose it. Of course if folk manage to lose weight , this approach is still relevant. But sometimes I see just stabilising weight is as much as can be achieved realistically. I think John Garrow's own method was to weigh himself at Christmas and take it off by Easter after making good use of Lent.   All this is just reiterating the post by Maxim. The great advantage of the net balance approach is that one does not have to fuss too much about special diets although it helps to cut out high sugar foodstuffs. And one has to learn to look on the packet and use a bit of common sense. Until I retired I did not bother much with regular meals.   On the occasions I venture out to restaurants 2 things amaze me 1. The meals provided are almost always high calorie and the size seems way OTT ;  2. Most of the other customers are already fairly fat and seem to manage to eat everything put in front of them.   Recently I realised my BMI will be on the rise : I have just been measured (not for a coffin) and find I am 3 inches shorter than in my youth , so perhaps I too will have to watch my intake more carefully....   What I would really like to know is whether any of you have found a reliable way of keeping the weights of your offspring under control : that is the really big question facing the UK and I know just how hard some parents find tackling it.-678bzb7fc7	sken	21/8/2015 8:04 PM	0	0

Targets across the country have aimed to improve the rates of uptake of breastfeeding and smoking cessation, but have not yet been successful in their goals. It has been suggested that financial incentives for health care providers may provide a solution to this problem, motivating providers to engage patients further.  In exploring the acceptability, mechanisms and consequences of provider incentives amongst health professionals, this study found that the subject of incentives provokes mixed views among staff. Provider incentives were generally favoured by non-medical staff, with doctors being more cautious. While incentives may encourage investment in support services which would be of value to pregnant women, the authors conclude that further experimental research is required prior to any policy interventions, given the mixed acceptability between health professionals.  What are your thoughts on provider incentives for meeting targets? Do you think that they could help providers achieve targets for breastfeeding and smoking cessation, or will they put services and care at risk?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   More information about this article:  Abstract     ObjectiveTo explore the acceptability, mechanisms and consequences of provider incentives for smoking cessation and breast feeding as part of the Benefits of Incentives for Breastfeeding and Smoking cessation in pregnancy (BIBS) study.    DesignCross-sectional survey and qualitative interviews.    SettingScotland and North West England.    ParticipantsEarly years professionals: 497 survey respondents included 156 doctors; 197 health visitors/maternity staff; 144 other health staff. Qualitative interviews or focus groups were conducted with 68 pregnant/postnatal women/family members; 32 service providers; 22 experts/decision-makers; 63 conference attendees.    MethodsEarly years professionals were surveyed via email about the acceptability of payments to local health services for reaching smoking cessation in pregnancy and breastfeeding targets. Agreement was measured on a 5-point scale using multivariable ordered logit models. A framework approach was used to analyse free-text survey responses and qualitative data.    ResultsHealth professional net agreement for provider incentives for smoking cessation targets was 52.9% (263/497); net disagreement was 28.6% (142/497). Health visitors/maternity staff were more likely than doctors to agree: OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.51 to 3.64; p<0.001). Net agreement for provider incentives for breastfeeding targets was 44.1% (219/497) and net disagreement was 38.6% (192/497). Agreement was more likely for women (compared with men): OR 1.81 (1.09 to 3.00; p=0.023) and health visitors/maternity staff (compared with doctors): OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.65 to 3.91; p<0.001). Key emergent themes were moral tensions around acceptability, need for incentives, goals, collective or divisive action and monitoring and proof. While provider incentives can focus action and resources, tensions around the impact on relationships raised concerns. Pressure, burden of proof, gaming, box-ticking bureaucracies and health inequalities were counterbalances to potential benefits.    ConclusionsProvider incentives are favoured by non-medical staff. Solutions which increase trust and collaboration towards shared goals, without negatively impacting on relationships or increasing bureaucracy are required.

1427	313	1	"Most people, dare I say most doctors, think of TB as a Dickensian scourge, now only seen in Third World countries with poor sanitation, crowded living and poor health systems.  Not so, at least, not so in London.  The Health Committee of the London Assembly has just published a report, ""Tackling TB in London"" that calls on the Mayor to, ""take political accountability for TB control"".    https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/FINAL_TacklingTBinLondon_1.pdf  The Assembly is an elected body to which the Mayor is responsible.  It works like the House of Commons to the Prime Minister, and has a number of specialist committees, as does Parliament, the Health Committee being one, to oversee the way that a Mayor is conducting the city's business.  Clearly the Assembly thinks that Boris Johnson is not doing a good job on health, and on TB in particular.  Why are they so alarmed? Here's why.  I can't show you the incidence map from the Assembly Report, but here is one from the Health Protection Agency in 2009    Then, in some areas of the Capital, 80 to 127 people per 100,000 had TB. The Assembly report is more detailed and shows pockets where the incidance is more than 150/100K.  The WHO classifies countries with more than 40/100K as having a ""High Incidence"" and the UK Government publishes a list of such countries tohelp NHS nurses todecide whether to give aBCGvaccination to children who have arrived in the UK from those countries.  Which countries have a higher incidence of TB than some areas of London? The list is distressingly long, and a disgrace to the World, but to have so much TB in the capital of a major European country is shameful. It's too long to list here, but take a look at which poor countries London competes with for the title, TB capital:  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/393840/Worldwide_TB_Surveillance_2013_Data_High_and_Low_Incidence_Tables____2_.pdf   John-5c5cb0b5nba1mojb7km80ab8b5fsayd6eydvhz"	John D	28/10/2015 10:17 AM	0	0

London;). In North Queensland there has been a problem of people coming across Torres Strait with TB from PNG and this is often resistant due to their imperfect health service I suppose a bit like London's.   I have seen one woman from the Phillippines who had a lump in her breast due to TB. I treat two women with sarcoidosis breast lumps, one having multiple lumps.   Atypical mycobacterial infections are more common particularly in Queensland where I live and where we also have salt water crocodiles and numerous other challenges to humankind.

1429	313	1	"Thank you, Odysseus!  I think your experience confirms the message from the Assembly's Report, that in most doctors' practices, TB is rare. But this means that awareness and vigilance are low.  New cases of TB in London accounted for 40% of all cases in the UK, and diagnosis was often delayed due to lack of recognition.   Where is is coming from?  The Report says that 80% with active TB are people who were born abroad. This can be no surprise, as only 45 % of Londoners in the 2011 census classified themselves as ""white British"", but it concludes that immigration procedures currently exclude active, infectious TB, and that latent disease would be impossible to detect and exclude, so increased immigartion control is not part iof the answer.  It emphasises the activation of latent TB by poor housing, poor nutrition and debilitating illness, exactly the conditions that made TB a scourge in 19th and early 20th centuries, and all things that public health measures can address.   I can just about remember mobile TB screening vans, that went about taking chest X-rays for pulmonary TB. Wolverhampton, where the incidence is only a little less than the 40/100K, set up mobile sscreening earlier this year, though not by X-ray, I think, and London is doing the same.    Tb rises again, and for the same reasons it did so before.     La Miseria by Cristobal Rojas, 1886   John-fe0b5e6b4j0c1f8b7j7n8"	John D	29/10/2015 10:02 AM	0	0

Does the London City Council warn tourists they are entering a microbiological danger zone.   We have signs up warning them of crocs and stingers. Perhaps a yellow street sign with Koch's bacillus or a photo of Keats coughing up arterial blood.   Defense de cracher (No spitting) signs were once common in France. Perhaps No Slagging signs?   This could be a good one to put out on Twitter and Facebook for travellers. Bring your own INAH for your mantoux conversion in London? Or Are you dying to visit Big Ben, your friendly bacillus...

1431	313	1	It's true that the majority of cases of active TB arein those born outside the UK butthe incidence in those appears to be falling according to Public Health England. The incidence is howeverincreasing in those bornin the UKwho sleep on the streets (as well as those with alcohol and drug problems or other immune defects). It's that group that posesthebiggest challenges for treatment and follow-up.   I'm not sure it's fair to saythat 'the NHS has let this happen'. It's true that the Public Health service hasbecome weakened in recent years but the real embarrassment is surely that Dickensian conditions stillexist alongside incrediblewealth ina city with the second highest houseprices in the world.

1432	314	1	"The incidence of ticks in the UK and th transmission of tick-bourne encephalitis is rising. So it's no great surprise to find the Sunday Telegraph with a whole page article about it. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11924482/Lyme-disease-cases-have-quadrupled.html   Unfortunately, they chose to feature a family in which the mother claims she was infected with Lyme disease by a blood transfusion, and that she then infected her two daughters, one of whom may have been in utero, AND her husband! As a public helath expert said, ""Possible, but unknown"".   Also disappointing, the article gave no advice on what to do if you find you have acquired a tick. In the US, where Lyme has been a problem for much longer, the CDC say that the insect should be removed as soon as possible, as transmission correlates with the length of time it stays on its victim, but condemns the use of Vaseline to asphyxiate the bug, or the application of heat from a cigarette or lighter.  http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html   Instead, CDC recommends pulling out the tick, using a fine pair of forceps applied to the mouth parts. Such an instrument may not always be to hand, but disposable levers, called ""Tick removers"" are available, for humans or animals, as they are even more likely to aquire a rider.

1433	315	1	The Guardian has reported how changes in the way Universities are ranked now give more recognition to the arts and humanities; previously, scientific and biomedical research carried much more weight. http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/15/british-universities-slip-downing-global-rankings   Not surprisingly, the change has caused controversy as some UK universities have lost ground in world rankings. Some have questioned how much these rankings really matter except to the business success of Universities.   The controversy might prompt us to look at the way UK medical schools are ranked and in what ways the rankings might or might not have any use. In a recent Student BMJ article Richard Wakeford has taken a critical look at some of the problems of ranking medical schools and how different guides use different criteria and so give different rankings for the same schools.   Student BMJ 2015;23:h1359   Wakeford suggests that prospective students choosing a school might do better to consult a new GMC database that ranks schools by markers of later career progress. The comparison, for example using pass rates for all major postgraduate exams, gives rather different ranking to the conventional ones.   Prospective medical students choose a medical school for all sorts of reasons. Social factors can be important for some. Some prefer to study a more traditional curriculum, others might choose a problem-based or integrated course. The measurable differences in outcome seem to be small but even with the GMC database we still dont know how to assess and compare the quality of doctors produced. Quality of teaching can be highly variable and difficult to gauge in advance; it is usually represented by student questionnaire result but we lack good measures of face-to face teaching quality.   One factor not included in any rankings is the quality of experience gained in the clinical institutions linked to each medical school. Recent events in Cambridge have highlighted the difficulties involved in making these judgements but, arguably, it is the clinical experience that might matter most in choosing where to study.   What do doc2doc members think of medical school rankings?    Are they genuinely useful in making informed choices about where to study or are they of more useful in attracting funding for schools?   This topic doesnt seem to lend itself easily to a traditional doc2doc poll.-6q7d5htjoi3griqb0hrh3fyh5j5ez69546fqtaj9cqtg1ax	Maxim	23/9/2015 10:21 PM	1	0
1434	315	1	I am glad I'm not young anymore. When I was a student we went to our local medical school by and large. We had little thought about university rankings. Indeed, I didn't know they existed.   I think this modern reality underlies the terrible stressors young students and doctors are under particularly if you include huge loans to pay for horrendous fees.   When I was a student university attendance was largely free.   I think modern medical education is a jungle which follows Darwinian principles. University ranking as well as Impact Factors in journals just reflect the laws of the jungle where the dominant predictor but not the most humane doctor wins.

1442	315	1	"""Do we rank outcomes like empathy, altruism, student mental health, later career fulfilment and contentment and suicide rate?""   When choosing a medical school for clinical training I well remember asking around about the differences. University rankings seem to relate predominantly to academic prowess but that may not be the most relevant for the student. The London was my top choice because of its reputation for offering a wealth of clinical experience and and an emphasis on straight clinical teaching and experience. The then UCH was seen as having a much more academic emphasis , St T's for those where ""social awareness"" was important and St M's for those wishing to continue with sporting ambitions etc... All these , and other , stereotypes of course will change over the years but in retrospect (for my rough contemporaries ) the stereotypes of my time seem to have been borne out.   So on grapevine knowledge , I suspect I might have made a similar choice to Odysseus. Of course basic academic standards are also relevant and I did not consider those where I felt this might be somewhat lacking. Perhaps there could be a place for mission statements - something I usually abhor - and the London motto was OK in this respect.   I suspect a bigger factor in choosing a medical school could be how readilly openings are available to jobs in that catchment area. Where would be my current bias - could well be Nottingham on what I have read and heard.   PS My wife (and brother) chose UCH.....-gn3btc77bzq4"	sken	1/10/2015 1:41 PM	0	0
1443	316	1	Recent figures show increasing numbers of obese or overweight pre-school aged children. Childhood obesity remains a complex public health challenge and is also associated with further adverse health outcomes later in life. Paes et altake a look at the factors influencing obesogenic dietary intake in young children, via a systematic review of qualitative literature, in a paper recently published in BMJ Open.  Obesogenic dietary intake is influenced by a number of factors, including parents, family, peer modelling and advertising, as well as a number of barriers, as seen in this investigation. The authors state that these findings support the rationale for designing and testing interventions to reduce obesogenic dietary intake in young children. These future interventions should aim to promote the modelling of positive behaviours and create an environment which promotes a healthy diet to children as they grow.  What do you think are the biggest challenges in overcoming overweight and obesity in young children? What types of interventions would you like to see and what would these involve?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   More information about this article:  Abstract   BackgroundObesogenic dietary intake is prevalent in young children and is associated with obesity and other adverse health outcomes in childhood and later in life.    ObjectiveTo describe the barriers to and facilitators of obesogenic dietary intake in early childhood, in order to inform interventions and public health policies to prevent obesity.    DesignSystematic review of qualitative literature on factors influencing obesogenic diets in children aged 06years.    Data sourcesMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, British Nursing Index, ASSIA and Sociological Abstracts.    Review methodsQualitative studies meeting the inclusion criteria were synthesised. Data were analysed by creating a thematic framework, underpinned by the socioecological model, which included familiarisation of data across the studies, indexing, charting, mapping and interpretation.    Results20 studies from the USA (10), Europe (6) and Australia (4) included the views of 1067 participants (901 parents/caregivers, 37 children, 87 teachers, 15 dieticians and 27 nursery staff). Study designs included focus groups (n=16), individual interviews (n=6) and ethnography (n=1) with some studies using more than one design. Despite wide differences in the study context and focus, several consistent themes emerged. Parental factors increasing young children's obesogenic diets were: negative parent/family/peer modelling, lack of knowledge, time constraints, using food as reward, affordability and concerns about child's health. Child preferences also increased intake. Environmental factors increasing intake include: availability, advertising, societal, cultural and preschool/childcare influences.    ConclusionsFuture intervention strategies should aim to promote modelling of positive behaviours, create home and preschool environments that promote healthy diets, and simultaneously target factors at the family and preschool/childcare levels.

1444	316	1	Emma   While an impressive amount of work went into this study I wonder what it's really added to what's already known. The problem of childhood obesity is one of the two or three most serious and urgent health problems in the UK. If this were an epidemic of an infectious disease (in one sense it is!) any Government would be in full crisis mode with ministers and pundits dashing off in all directions to contain the problem.   The scale and intensity of this problem has gone beyond anything that can wait for the measured and leisurely approach of 'promoting modelling of postitive behaviours...etc' although those are needed in the longer term. Some radicalthings have to be done now and some of those things need urgentgovernment (it should have started with the last two) intervention on a national scale. This would certainly include limitations on the food and advertising industries. What I fear happening is that some idiot will alter the definitions of obesity and overweight as a quick fix (don't laugh, it has been mentioned)   Starving one's children is seen as child abuse and can be dealt with by social services and the criminal justice system. Whilst the motivation for overfeeding childrenor allowing theirovereating is not usually done maliciously it has equally serious consequences and is happening on a much greater scale. Money has to flow quickly to allow social services and health visitors to be muchmore robust in their approach. The education has to start prenatally and doesn't have to wait for further lengthy studies. I'm usually an advocate of respecting other peoples' feelings but the fear of giving offence has here allowed the problem toget further out of control.   The approach of recent Governments has been to 'nudge' people into less damaging behaviours. This approach, based on Chicagobehavioural economics and led by the 'behavioural insight unit' is fine for less serious circumstances but is totally inadequate for this one. If nothing else the multimillion pound industries are shoving so hard in the other direction that nudges backare irrelevant.-x48c6de33bna7dxeyd1j4c3br4jqd4a6g4f1a9g6a6ls	Maxim	22/9/2015 6:32 PM	0	0

Particularly a Society that does not believe in personal responsibility and wants a health service which will restore anyone to as near to normality as possible without any effort on the part of the patient and regardless of cost. In particular we do everything we can to ensure that those who have relative infertility from obesity have no problem in propagating to the limits of their capability. The good news is that some of the food industry is changing - not from any encouragement from the politicians but more as an image promotion.    Similarly we are incapable of doing anything really constructive to tackle the problem of the rising world population and of late the view seems to be emerging that anyone dissatisfied with conditions in their own country should have a right of entry elsewhere going well beyond any question of refugee status.

1446	317	1	Salloum et al's paper on waterpipe tobacco smoking, recently published in BMJ Open, indicates an increasing prevalence of waterpipe smoking, particularly among university students. With evidence showing that it can be harmful to health, waterpipe tobacco smoking is something that should be studied carefully, to avoid it becoming a major public health issue.  This study, the first to elicit preferences from users, showed an increasing demand for waterpipe smoking in young adults - which can be attributed to factors such as pleasant fruit-flavoured tobacco, lower nicotine content labels and lack of understanding of the health warnings associated with waterpipe smoking.  In general, participants of the study preferred fruit-flavoured varieties to the standard tobacco flavour. They were also averse to options labelled as having a higher nicotine content, and those exposed to a health warning before smoking were more likely to opt out.  What are your thoughts on this emerging public health issue? Should there be waterpipe-specific regulation that prevents the avaliability of flavoured tobacco and therefore it's popularity? Would this work?   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   More information about this article:  Abstract   ObjectivesWaterpipe smoking is highly prevalent among university students, and has been increasing in popularity despite mounting evidence showing it is harmful to health. The aim of this study was to measure preferences for waterpipe smoking and determine which product characteristics are most important to smokers.    SettingA large university in the Southeastern USA.    ParticipantsAdult waterpipe smokers attending the university (N=367).    DesignParticipants completed an Internet-based discrete choice experiment to reveal their preferences for, and trade-offs between, the attributes of hypothetical waterpipe smoking sessions. Participants were presented with waterpipe lounge menus, each with three fruit-flavoured options and one tobacco flavoured option, in addition to an opt out option. Nicotine content and price were provided for each choice. Participants were randomised to either receive menus with a text-only health-warning message or no message.    Outcome measuresMultinomial and nested logit models were used to estimate the impact on consumer choice of attributes and between-subject assignment of health warnings respectively.    ResultsOn average, participants preferred fruit-flavoured varieties to tobacco flavour. They were averse to options labelled with higher nicotine content. Females and non-smokers of cigarettes were more likely than their counterparts to prefer flavoured and nicotine-free varieties. Participants exposed to a health warning were more likely to opt out.    ConclusionsFruit-flavoured tobacco and lower nicotine content labels, two strategies widely used by the industry, increase the demand for waterpipe smoking among young adults. Waterpipe-specific regulation should limit the availability of flavoured waterpipe tobacco and require accurate labelling of constituents. Waterpipe-specific tobacco control regulation, along with research to inform policy, is required to curb this emerging public health threat.

1447	318	1	Mass media campaigns can often be a very powerful way of spreading public health messages. Campaigns can reach the public in a number of ways, including television adverts, newspapers and the Internet.  However, there can often be concerns about their ethics (having been imposed on a population who have not consented), their expense and their usefulness in spreading healthy messages and initiating healthy behaviours.  A systematic review by Allara et al, recently published in BMJ Open, aimed to assess the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in preventing or reducing drug use or the intention to use drugs among young people. They found inconsistency in the evidence available to them in the published literature and as such could draw no general conclusion to answer this question currently - showing that more consideration and research in the future may need to be given to assessing these interventions.  What do you think - can mass media campaigns be effective in preventing drug use? Perhaps they are more effective for one population or for other types of intervention?   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   More information about this article:  Abstract   ObjectiveTo determine whether there is evidence that mass-media campaigns can be effective in reducing illicit drug consumption and the intent to consume.    DesignSystematic review of randomised and non-randomised studies.    MethodsWe searched four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I and CENTRAL) and further explored seven additional resources to obtain both published and unpublished materials. We appraised the quality of included studies using standardised tools. We carried out meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and a pooled analysis of interrupted time-series and controlled before-and-after studies.    ResultsWe identified 19 studies comprising 184811 participants. Pooled analyses and narrative synthesis provided mixed evidence of effectiveness. Eight interventions evaluated with randomised controlled trials leaned towards no evidence of an effect, both on drug use (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.02; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.12) and the intention to use drugs (SMD 0.07; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.04). Four campaigns provided some evidence of beneficial effects in preventing drug use and two interventions provided evidence of iatrogenic effects.    ConclusionsStudies were considerably heterogeneous in type of mass-media intervention, outcome measures, underlying theory, comparison groups and design. Such factors can contribute to explaining the observed variability in results. Owing to the risk of adverse effects, caution is needed in disseminating mass-media campaigns tackling drug use. Large studies conducted with appropriate methodology are warranted to consolidate the evidence base.

1448	318	1	Very good that this distinguished group of researcher took care of this question. The results are exactly the way as I expected it as an addiction researcher and contradict the opinion of many prevention specialists worldwide. I hope that drug use prevention resources will be used for more promising drug use prevention models reaching those at risk and helping those who are progressing already in drug use and at risk for drug abuse or dependence in the coming years. The Internet possess a great potential for screening, identify and tailor stepped-care information and interventions to the corresponding general population groups. First examples of Internet and Mobile-phone drug use prevention trials demonstrated effectiveness. However, a lot has still to be done. Let us work together. Prevention, treatment and research specialists should learn from each other and foster better collaboration.	Michael.Schaub	4/9/2015 12:41 PM	1	0
1449	318	1	Interesting point, the better allocation of limited resources in Prevention. There is room for collaboration and synergies. Interventions need to be multifaceted and International stakeholders are vital to effective Knowledge Exchange. Thank you Michael Schaub for your remark.	Marica Ferri	4/9/2015 3:50 PM	0	0

I started my career in 1991 in State Government services. At different phases of life, I enjoyed working in a different environment in India, Zambia and Botswana. In India and Zambia i worked as a full time Gynecologist and Obstetrician. The major challenge came in my life when I started my career in Botswana in 2002.. In Botswana, I got license to work as a General medical practioner. I took it as a challenge, and did my best to update myself in general medical, and surgical cases. I did advance course for HIV management also. I started enjoying working as a general practitioner very soon, and feeling more as a complete Doctor. I feel my best clinical expertization is in t Obstetric cases with medical Disorders, paediatric cases, and complicated medical disorders. I put special emphasis on drug interactions. I am a strong advocate of preventive aspect of hereditary cancers, preventable cancers, and chronic medical disorders.   My expectation from this forum is to interact with other doctors by sharing our good cases and challenging cases. We can learn from each other's mistakes also, so I will not hesitate to share my mistakes which happened in our long journey of career, and expect others also to do the same.   I am also an online Doctor for Health Care Magic.   Dr Haseena Hamdani-m81b4bc49e3	HHAMDANI	18/10/2013 2:24 PM	0	0

1460	320	1	"I would love to hear your thoughts!!   Statistics show 66% of all patients who visit an urgent care clinic, or ""walk in clinic"" have a primary care physician. The question is - WHY are these people going to a ""walk in clinic"" over visiting their PCP whom they have a relationship with? I believe the answer is simple...convenienceand accessibility. People just don't want to wait a week to see their doctor. We expect to do our banking 24/7, shopping 24/7, and now people want their healthcare to be 24/7. I say, let's equip our PCP's with the tools they need to care for their patients remotely to help them fight the battle with retail / urgent clinics and telehealth companies (where no doctor/patient relationship is established). It's time for doctors to get their patients back!!  Question - As a doctor, if you had the option to care for your patients in a way as simple as ""SMS texting"" and it was done over a HIPAA compliant platform and you got paid, would you do it? If not, why?   1.2 billion primary care doctor visits happened last year, roughly 700 million of those could have been done remotely. That's 70%!!-9w3au6"	brittanyfkahn	19/5/2016 4:28 PM	0	0

1462	321	1	We are now well into the rhubarb season and those that indulge will be well aware of the potential effect on the gut. A visitor to the UK unused to this could well be classified as having travellers diaorrhoea (TD). Many specialists like to give their special interest an all-inclusive nature. Think psychiatrists and depression or borderline personality disorders.    By defining TD as 3 or more loose motions daily , we include many folk where this is their normal  but once they cross the Channel it becomes a disease. The effect I notice with goodly helpings of rhubarb I have when abroad after consuming many of the varied vegetables on offer  often soaked in copious amounts of oil. And that is apart from all those figs in season. BO 3 X daily : if only  and what about the night time as well And of course any urgency is likely to affect social functioning so I automatically move to a more severe stage of TD by definition. Co-incidentally , I may have a change in my gut flora , but that would not be unexpected.    When challenged , those with a particular interest in TD can become incredibly defensive  reminiscent of the psychiatrist who will react with details of patients with severe or psychotic depression to suggestions that minor degrees of being down-the-dumps for a short time does not equate with psychiatric disease.       Perhaps we need to change the definition of TD to one where the disturbance of bowel function is   A. 1. A disturbance beyond the normal bowel habit for the individual ;   2. Not corrected by a bland diet ;   3. Associated with feeling unwell ;   4. Not responding to 2-6 mgs of loperamide daily ;   or B. . Persisting after return to the UK ,( but needing recognition that any TD may have precipitated the onset of IBS) when a wider differential diagnosis might be relevant.    C. Any significant features such as pyrexia , blood in the stools etc.. are red flag symptoms requiring a different approach and these travellers should not be dismissed as having a tummy upset and lumped together with those with milder symptoms. And as for the outbreaks of Norovirus on cruise ships , I would see that as something else altogether and remain thankful that I do not feel tempted anyway by embarking on one of those floating townships (by now not just floating hotels).   The aim of being more restrictive in our definition of TD is in part to discourage the overuse of antibiotics , prophylactic and recognise the true incidence of TD where these might be effective.-9z9dsfa87cqcmd23ad9rokv24953egfanewql40ceohkxam5aouyzi5as22	sken	25/5/2016 6:21 PM	0	0
1463	322	1	Hi, I was wondering if there are any Indian doctors here that would see my friend and write him a prescription to undergo Liquid Biopsy tests for Cancer. This is very urgent as he can not find a doctor that will allow.	VM950	23/5/2016 6:01 PM	0	0
1464	322	1	Just what is the urgency - eg general anxiety or for management of a specific cancer and a reason for avoiding biopsy?   I am not sure just how readily these tests are available anyway and one would want to be sure the tester has methods that have been suitably validated. If there really is a good enough reason for going ahead it might be worth approaching one of the units engaged in research.   I would also be very wary of any doctor who just filled in the form for the test without details and ideally seeing the patient first. And making sure that adequate follow-up was in place. As with many cancer tests there is a bit more to it than that Particularly when dealing with those who may be a bit twitchy for whatever reason.-wit9p4	sken	24/5/2016 6:03 PM	0	0

I found this misleading - is the suggestion that all these benefits are provided by medically / surgically qualified osteopaths , as suggested by the ""and"" in ""and the use technology etc..."" ? Or is - as I think may be the case - that the benefits are provided without resort to conventional assessment etc...? If the latter is suggested then it must come close to contravening advertising rules. Whilst I have met individuals who clearly date their improvement to osteopathic intervention , encouraging people with possible incipient spinal cord compression and other disorders in the differential diagnosis to by-pass conventional care seems to me to be potentially dangerous. But then wasn't it NICE that lumped low back pain and sciatica together recently , so folks might be better off seeing someone who understands there is a difference.....

1474	326	1	A poem by a medical student. Your thoughts please (on the poem or death or otherwise?)   -  The Indignity of Death   That moment is fearsome;   When the body trembles under the weight of death.   The eyes fix, the pupils dilate.   These Doctors have seen it before,   More frequently than they can recall.   This is the departure of the soul.   A flight with an unpredictable take-off.   It can start with red herrings;   Something so simple, like no air.   And when you notice the drowning:   The swimming in and out of consciousness,   The training kicks in.   The reflexive actions occur with little thought.   They try to preserve it,   To stop the soul from leaking away.   Sometimes it works, but this time it does not.   She dies on that narrow metal trolley.   Her cut-up dress baring the bruises on her chest    The remnants of chest compressions.   Her face is slack, turning blue and dulled.   The team step back with a sigh.   Whether it is relief or resignation, it is hard to tell.   Then they watch and wait;   Waiting for the flat line to mark the finality of death.   She is alone,   In a cold, clinical place of healing.   Yet it failed to heal in this instance.   It is pitiful  her loneliness, her nakedness.   The paperwork is filled, the red tape adhered to.   Her husband is then told of her departure.   His wizened face is emotionless    Perhaps he, too, has become accustomed to death like these Doctors.   But for me, it is beyond tragic.   This lonely, undignified death scares me.   I never want to lose this fear.   I never want death to become an insignificant part of life.   I stand in my corner and pray for her soul,   And pray for mine too,   As they take the shell of my fellow human away.-yb015i3kas	MHMQ786	17/5/2016 5:43 PM	0	0
1475	326	1	As a prospective doctor. you are right to not want to become hardened to death.  You 'stand in a corner' to contemplate this one after the event, perhaps to escape the hubbub of clearing up and readying the emergency room, which cannot be delayed as the next case may be here at once.   You may want to stand aside from the rough black humour that medics use as psychic armour, but you need some protection or your soul will not survive. Use that release, join in with its use, when you have finished your prayer.   John-wxnb8rb6	John D	18/5/2016 8:01 AM	0	0
1476	326	1	"Congratulations to this student - good to see this degree of involvement in the realities of modern medicine. It deserves a wider audience. Reflects some of what David Oliver was saying in his BMJ column recently. There is an underlying theme that the victim (and I see the subjects of CPR as victims all too often) is very elderly - ""the wizened"" face of the husband possibly ""accustomed to death"" suggesting that many of their friends or family have also died. This coupled with the lack of emotional and personal involvement by the resus team who are just doing their job makes this a poem full of insight. The bit about the soul seems OK as well even though one does not believe in such an entity and perhaps it is meant figuratively. Perhaps a prayer for the author's own soul is also in place at having been a witness to this aspect of modern medicine.   I have just finished re-reading Camus' ""A Happy Death"" - some great thoughts in the last few chapters also looking at why some have a terror of dying.   Please convey my appreciation to the author and my best wishes for the future. A high price may have to be paid but I would not want to see the underlying questioning of what we do to disappear in the hurly-burly of modern medical ""care"".-ep7"	sken	18/5/2016 12:04 PM	0	0
1477	326	1	Hi MHMQ   You first posted this poem (which I'm guessing you wrote)in July 2014 when you were a 4th year medical student on an overseas elective in the West Midlands of the UK. At that time you asked about 'acceptance of death' and there followed some comments that you said were helpful.   Presumably you might now be qualified and perhaps working as a doctor (not sure whether UK or abroad) and the reposting of your poem, with a request for thoughts, seems to suggest that this is still a topic occupying your mind.   Leaving aside the more philosophical aspects of 'accepting' death (from whichnone of us willever return to discuss the experience of our own unless misdiagnosed!)it seems reasonable to offer a few thoughts on the 'indignity of death' that is well-observed in your poem. That might be something which all doctors should be able to minimiseby learning to recognise and accept when a patient is getting near to the end of life andwhen striving to keep themalive is both useless and cruel. Some doctors are never able or willing to recognise this phase of life and that's oftenwhenpatients are forced intothat undignified andlonely mode of death in an acute hospital instead of at home or in a hospice where the indignities could largely be avoided. We hear a lot of criticism about poorpractice arounddeath of patients in acute hospitalsand that hospice care could be replicated there. That seems disingenuous given that hospices wouldn't do so well if theyhad to deal with general acute clinical problems alongsidepatients expected to die.   If facilities to allow this better death are lacking wherever you practice then perhaps you could use your poem and observations to campaign for better services.   My other observation would be that too few medical students and junior doctors now have enough experience of all the matters surrounding death. Time is not spent with patients who are near death and many students haven't even seen a dead body in the dissecting room, clinicalarea or mortuarybefore they qualify.   One's own spiritual beliefs are one's own decision but should never be projected onto patients. A commonexample that I always found worrying was the practice of avoiding writing in the notes that a patient had 'died' but instead putting a euphemism such as 'RIP'. You only have to think about the implications of this for a moment to realise how ridiculous and imappropriateitmightseem when read in some circumstancesby others whether family, coroner or otherlegal person.-vx9d2dxtpa4ewf3cve0a6a2geyu6npa0b0c7dycza42aueqau2hj3npecf0b5	Maxim	18/5/2016 3:22 PM	0	0
1478	326	1	In line with the indignity of the death for the presumptively old person in the poem , a recent study of old folk (75-96) recently* showed that only 1/3 wanted to reach 100 and those that wanted this often had caveats about remaining healthy. An overall 74% response rate of the 2,000+ community dwelling elders was pretty good -perhaps suggesting some of these people felt quite strongly about this question. It was of course not a UK study (it comes from Finland). The very idea that 2 out of every 3 old people might not wish to live as long as possible would be seen as unacceptable in the UK , with a growing emphasis on asking the family rather than the patient about what should be done. So grit your teeth , get used to resuscitation  and become adept in lying to the family that the patient died peacefully and without distress despite your best efforts .. But also double-check that it is not your own fear of death that is the root problem.   My current experiences of those who are coming towards the end of life range from the desperate to live whilst dying from cancer to the reasonably well but seeing life as somehow nearing competion in old age - and knowing a degree of self determination since no mortal illness. Our obsession throughout the current NHS is to try to define a one-size -fits all and that is what the next generation has to correct. Particularly when it comes to the end of life.   *Age and Ageing(2016)doi:10.1093/ageing/afw059-rn2bse70aiska082929i64w	sken	18/5/2016 10:01 PM	0	0

I didn't know that dance was so popular, or an Olympic sport!  No, they are for different sports, judo, fencing, wheelchair rugby etc.  And a tennis arena, with only one court - no idea where the rest of the matches will take place. Need to find out!

If you are a medical imaging specialist, come on in!   As it happens, I get regular emails from a company that auctions medical kit, and I don't believe it is unique.  So as not break the rules myself, I'll not post their address here, but you can Google for 'medical auctions' as well as anybody!   John-wgm0eb1	John D	6/5/2016 11:23 AM	0	0

When so many are trivial, it's good to see something useful in the 'App' world.   When I say ""approval"" , NICE's MIBs (""Medtech Innovation Briefing"", not ""Men In Black""!) are neither guidance in their usual way, nor judgement or recommendation for the devices.  But the AliveCor does seem to excite them!  It is a plug-in item for your mobile, that has two metal contact pads that will take fingers or palms.  Press them against the pads if you feel queasy, and it will record your ECG, diagnose and transmit the record to your doctor, or let them read the result later on, straight off the phone.  The manufacturers intend it for the detection of paroxysmal AF, and when the device costs less than 70 and is resuable, it has to have cost advantages over the conventional 24 ECG recorder.   I don't intend to advertise this device - I am unqualified to do so - and you can read the NICE briefing at https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/mib35.

With respect to dentists in particular, there are few environments where doctors and dentists overlap and thus where a patient might be confused by a dentist calling themself ""doctor."" And dentists in hospitals are often dual qualified so could legitimately use either title.Personally I'm not too fussed what my dentist/podiatrist/nurse calls themselves so long as they do the job they're qualified for competently and professionally.-sw3a1y4"	HelenJ	11/10/2011 10:13 AM	0	0
1505	331	1	As I add to my experiences as a patient , I am increasingly intrigued by post-operative advice. No evidence is given for most of the instructions and it is way OTT compared with the common sense approach of years gone by. I have been browsing through some of the recommendations across the board. In my own field I would never have suggested to a patient having a colonoscopy + polypectomy that lifting a 5lbs weight was taboo (What ? No overcoat in cold weather?) so have become even less inclined now to have that procedure.... Being advised to walk less than a mile a day for 2 weeks after cystoscopic polypectomy seems to be increasing the risk of DVT. Driving remains subject to some bizarre restrictions - discuss with your insurance company +/- GP after any GA and a wide variety of operations. My impression (after a THR) was that the insurance company did not want to know - OK no driving for 48 hrs after GA (judgement possibly impaired) and no driving after certain operations until confident about emergency stopping....but those are common sense instructions and ignoring them likely to lead to a problem whether or not a phone call made to the insurance company or seen by GP (see your GP is becoming the least practical of all suggestions. A face to face discussion took nearly 3 months last time).   What drives doctors to connive in these instructions - is it because they feel the quality of life of patients is of little concern in line with the general trend? Is it because somehow it boosts the significance of their interventions ? Is it because of some misconception about medico-legal matters? Is it because there is competition with the increasingly cuckoo advice put out by physicians and pharmacistsand medical treatment and possible (just possible , at least in theory ) interactions?   The net result of including some cuckoo advice along with the relevant is that the entire package comes in for ridicule. There is much to be said for EBM - surely we owe it to our patients not to limit their lives without good reason? And if these restrictions do have an adequate rationale then it needs to be evidence based and explained before surgery .	sken	30/3/2016 9:46 AM	0	0
1506	331	1	I was recently the recipient of some 'cuckoo' health and safety concerns. I had a Gastroscopy as an out patient and was impressed with the whole process. Great communication from Doctors and Nurses with me, quick procedure and given results straight after it was completed. But then it became a little bizarre. A short while after the Gastroscopy the nurse rechecked my BP, P Sats etc and all was well. I had not had sedation (indeed did not receive meds of any description) so she said I could leave as soon as I felt ready. She asked how I was getting home. Due to the dreadful lack of car parking facilities at the hospital I explained I had arranged to call my wife who would pull up outside the main hospital doors and I would jump in. The nurse was not pleased with this arrangement. 'Wouldn't it be better' she said 'if your wife came up to endoscopy reception and walked you down to the car'?. Once again I explained the car parking difficulties and that I felt perfectly well and had had no drugs to impair me. Nevertheless she said she would prefer it if my wife walked me down. I enquired why she felt it necessary for my wife to walk me down. She said that if I suddenly felt unwell or collapse I might fall and injure myself. I asked her whether she thought I was likely to collapse or fall, did she know something I didn't? She said I would probably be fine but if I fell or tripped the hospital might be liable.   I found this logic peculiar. What happens to all the people coming and going throughout the day at the hospital? Are they all supervised lest they trip or fall? I reassured her that I would take the utmost care navigating the perilous route from endoscopy reception to the car and should I come a cropper would absolve the hospital of responsibility.   One can understand such concerns had I been elderly or infirm. Or had some medical problem that might affect my balance but this just seemed OTT.   Needless to say I did manage to get to the car without mishap or crisis and arrived home in one piece.   kirked-b68	kirked	30/3/2016 11:01 AM	0	0
1507	331	1	"kirked - glad you made it.... My experience last year was similar. A minor procedure (joint injection) for which some patients are given a whiff of something but which I declined. Afterwards told I was not ""allowed"" to stand up until I had had something to eat or drink. The nursing hostility to my pointing out that I had NOT had any sedative made absolutely no difference. Clearly I was an awkward patient in their eyes and I was already aware that I might need another injection at some stage. I was tempted to just get up and go but that would have meant major confrontation. The point of my original post was that much of what is now told to patients seems to have very little evidence base - at bit like the ""No conkers"" for school children. Nothing to do with official Health and Safety"" but more reflecting a level of panic lower down the line. And for many nurses a rule is a rule and any questioning a matter of heresy.   I was much reassured to see that a primary school which owns a bit of wild land , not far from here , teaches Stoneage crafts (including making bows and arrows) and clay pigeon shooting etc... along with the usual curriculum.

1508	331	1	"I don't think doctors write these cautions, even if they 'connive' at them by allowing them to be issued.   But I've noticed that patients leaving the obstetric unit are not allowed to carry their new infants, presumably for similar reasons, despite the hangover of birth lasting twenty years.   I will yield to no one in my admiration for nurses (I'm married to one for goodness sake!) but their training and ethos is to follow procedures, something doctors are very bad at, even when it's the right thing to do.  And it's senior nurses who are more likely to write ""guidance for patients"" documents, so if the managers say, ""no risk!"", that's how they will write it.    On driving, the AAGBI's ""Guidelines for day surgery"" https://www.aagbi.org/sites/default/files/Day%20Case%20for%20web.pdf have long said ""Following most procedures under general anaesthesia, a responsible adult should escort the patient home and provide support for the first 24 hours.""

People and organisations thatcan't allow, let alone welcome, questioning and challenging areunable to learn and improve. Perhaps assessing suitability for working in (or running)the Health Service should include testing the responses to being robustlyquestioned and challenged.   This is one of the things thatconcerns me about the current obsession with the need to train leaders. If you look at the articles trying to justify this (the evidence is extremely thin) it becomes clear that theidea is mostlyfor people who will 'persuade' others to follow centrally-driven plans for the Health Service, howevercuckoo and damaging those are.-uruta4a7d2a2d2dzc0dzfo6	Maxim	30/3/2016 1:47 PM	0	0

1511	331	1	Sken,   You are right about my wife's age, although such a large difference might put one of us up on a charge of cradle snatching.  And she is the product of the old nurse training system that was an apprenticeship long after medical training g ceased to be that.  She is contemptjous of 'degree nurse' training as it does not eqip the graduates for the shit-shovelling reality of ward nursing.    It could be that that system is at fault - I could not say - but it cannot be to do with being, mainly, a female profession, as previous generations showed.   I am either fortunate or too pig-headed to be a bullying victim.

1526	334	1	Last April a Northern Irish woman who bought pills over the internet to induce an abortion was given a suspended three month prison sentence. The woman had told her housemates that she tried to travel to England for a termination but could not cover her costs. She had then been told by a clinic about mifepristone and misoprostol, available on the internet that would induce a miscarriage.      The Abortion Act 1967 does not apply in NI. Under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, anyone carrying out an abortion in Northern Ireland, except under some extremely limited circumstances, can be jailed for life. Last year the High Court in NI ruled that current legislation is in breach of The Human Rights Act. The NI government however are extremely unlikely to adhere to such rulings - politics in NI is deeply mixed with religious affiliation. There have been a number of high profile cases across the island of Ireland involving abortion and in 2012 the case of Dentist Savita Halappanavar (see http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2232676/Savita-Halappanavar-dies-Irish-doctors-refuse-abortion-saying-This-Catholic-country.html ) saw people protesting on parliament.      The Republic of Ireland also has strict abortion laws. Just this week a United Nations human rights committee called on the ROI to reform its law on abortion, after holding that the countrys virtual ban on abortion subjected a woman to cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment, violating her human rights. A UN panel of experts found that Irelands virtual ban on abortion had forced Amanda Mellet to choose between continuing her non-viable pregnancy or travelling to another country while carrying a dying foetus, at personal expense, and separated from the support of her family, and to return while not fully recovered.      This is an emotive issue and much more time and space would be required to outline the complexities of Irish politics (and I am not remotely an expert) but I wonder how this can play out. Those demanding legislation be put in line with the rest of the UK are passionate about women's rights but so too are those who see abortion as immoral.      Is there any common ground? What would it be?      Kirked-hh2dd30ftt0kwb731898jqean4zzt	kirked	12/6/2016 11:13 AM	0	0

I also authored a post in BMJ blogs about the doctors strike in Colombia. I believe it is necessary to update my own story as well as the events related with labor unions and doctor strikes in Colombia.      (i) About my story: a judge ordered about 6 weeks ago my reintegration to my previous job post at the Universidad del Valle protecting me with the constitutional rights of forced labor stability, due process, and health. I am grateful for the opportunities of life because two and a half years ago I was hospitalized at the HUV because of an ""acute psychosis"", ""paranoia"", and ""delusions of persecution"" about pharmaceutical companies (maybe for some psychiatrists you have to be delusional to not believe in the altruism and generosity of pharmaceutical companies. It is quite ironic, that short lasting (< 2 days) psychiatric hospitalization allowed me to be elected the last week as president (i.e., legal representative) of the association of users (i.e., patients) at the Hospital Universitario del Valle (HUV). In addition, about 4 weeks ago I presented a lecture of antipsychotics to medical students of Univalle. We (Asousuarios HUV) would like to review thoroughly the price of medicines at the HUV. (1) This situation reminds me the title of a paper published on The BMJ: ""Let the patient revolution begin"":      (ii) Update: the doctors strike in Colombia      Events of discomfort continue: a major focus of tensions between workers and the government (mainly at the departmental level - Valle del Cauca) is the Hospital Universitario del Valle ""Evaristo Garca"" - HUV (Cali, Colombia). The HUV is the largest public hospital in the southwestern region of Colombia, Dr. Ricardo Gallego president SIMAC - Sindicato Mdico Nacional (translation: National Labor Union of Doctors) have called to an open assembly to discuss the situation of the HUV, it have unfortunately become a center of propaganda by some unscrupulous politicians. Asousuarios HUV endorses Dr. Gallego in his call for a general assembly at the hospital - now it is a movement of doctors organized through a legally constituted labor union (SIMAC) with the support of patients - users of the medical services at the HUV.

If they have little say then their practice would be commandeered by non-clinical personnel to the end of definite failure.

1539	339	1	I imagine you have heard about the forced closure of up to 3,000 (1 in 4) pharmacies in the UK from October 2016  but have you considered the impact on the medical profession? The impact on GP surgeries, A&E departments and the medical profession generally will be MASSIVE. If pharmacies are unable to cope, they could have no choice but to refer patients to their GP and/or A&E. This could lead to a dangerous game of healthcare tennis. The NHS could crumble under the pressure, and the workload increase for doctors and nurses could be incredible, irreparably damaging the medical profession (who would want to work under those conditions?)   As background, the government recently announced cuts to pharmacy funding of 170m over 6 months, equivalent to 340m on an annual basis (a 12.2% cut). NHS prescription items will grow by 2.5% in the same period. Across an entire primary healthcare sector (community pharmacy), thats HUGE.   Pharmacy minister Alistair Burt said that up to 3,000 pharmacies could close, with smaller independents more likely to suffer. This appears to be anti-small business and could have a dreadful impact on local communities who rely upon the pharmacy.   The remaining pharmacies will be under much greater pressure, which could have a massive impact on patient safety. They will still need to dispense 1 billion NHS items per year between them and will likely cut staff, even if they do have the space to cope with the extra prescriptions. Patients will probably have to travel further and vulnerable patients could be put at risk (e.g. housebound, disabled, blind patients). People could be deprived of accessible medicines advice and support from trusted pharmacists. Free services such as prescription deliveries may be stopped.   A petition against the cuts already has 50,000 signatures but needs 100,000 signatures to get a debate in parliament. Ultimately Im making this post to ask for your help with the petition and to raise awareness as Im not sure everyone realises how bad this government decision is - for patients, doctors, pharmacists and the NHS generally.  https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/116943 (also accessible via the short link bit.ly/savemypharmacy)-w27d8a672613nfslaz1ap	esurfer	21/3/2016 3:43 PM	1	0

1542	340	1	The MDU is currently giving advice on consent following the Montgomery case (reminder : risk of shoulder dystocia in patient with risk factors). As usual much of the MDU advice is impractical in the hustle and bustle of day-to-day life , but there is a very relevant point in emphasising that consent has to be what one might call ad hominem - that is tailored to the individual. This I think is a fundamental point. It means that postal consent , information sheets about procedures etc.. have a more limited value than often supposed even if studies suggest these are acceptable to groups of patients.   The practicalities and overall functioning of the NHS is not the concern of those giving legal opinions but these judgements do leave the jobbing doctor in a difficult position.   Just how we cope is unclear but I suspect we will have to go on much as before driven by clinical pressures and weighing these against the risk of legal action. It might be interesting to see just how much operating time would be lost if surgeons , anaesthetists and endoscopists etc.. as well as obstetricians. really did go through full consent rituals every time. What will happen of course is that time will be given to those who demand it , with the usual rider that it will be taken from others. And of course however long one spends on consent and however ideally it is carried out , there will be no guarantees that a complaint will not be forthcoming .   Good luck to those still working - as a patient on a number of occasions , I can't say that I have ever experienced the level of information suggested nor had an appointment where there would have been anywhere near enough time to go through the issues involved. When having a procedure I see that I am mainly responsible for information gathering and i am very critical of those prepared to leap on to an operating table having done less of this than they would if buying - for example- a new lawnmower. For those lacking capability or capacity other arrangements are needed , but perhaps we should not always take the lowest common denominator as the determinant of good practice ?-oi0d1go0	sken	20/4/2016 7:59 PM	0	0
1543	341	1	This isn't really much about medicine but is an interesting issue. For the last few weeks newspapers and TV news have followed an injunction from the High Court banning them naming a male celebrity who allegedly had a liaison with two other people. To breach an injunction and thereby be in Contempt of Court can have serious implications for Journalists, proprietors and publishers; a heavy fine and custodial sentence strong possibilities.   However, the current 'super injunction' has essentially been undermined because a newspaper in the Republic of Ireland and various Internet sites (in the USA, China, Canada and Europe) have already published the celebrities' name. Judges in the UK can only enforce laws within its jurisdictions. Clearly the internet and social media have proliferated enormously over the last two decades since the Human rights Act came into force and a senior Judge yesterday essentially implied he would lift the injunction subject to an appeal by the celebrities' lawyer.   Such injunctions are used almost exclusively by rich 'celebrities' (often famous for being famous and not having contributed anything very substantial to society), footballers and the like but how much do the public need to know about someone's private life? Frequently such injunctions are used to keep extramarital affairs secret or other behaviour that one would not find very appealing. Should such folk have the right to privacy? What type of information is genuinely of public interest rather than of interest to the public? Do people have a prurient interest in people's private lives?   The current injunction remains in place but one survey (referenced by the Court) showed that 1:5 people questioned knew the name of the celebrity involved. Indeed it has been very simple to discover his identity online.   Would it be acceptable for a well known Doctor to take out a super injunction to protect his reputation if it was discovered he had behaved in a scandalous way in his private life quite at odds with what he professes to be in public?   Just curious to see what folk might think of this issue.   kirked	kirked	19/4/2016 12:02 PM	0	0
1544	341	1	"There was another 'celebrity' who came up with the killer argument, ""He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.  And that was a matter of adultery.   But there is a difference between 'mere' sexual shananegans, and hypocrisy.   A politician who inveighs against infidelity, and cries up the sanctity of marriage should be revealed if they transgress their vows. Maybe they are just human, but they have already demanded superhuman restraint form everyone else.  The empty 'celebrity', the footballer, is held up as an example of excellence, a model for others, so when they transgress and are unfaithful, they have betrayed not only their partner but the fans who made them rich and famous.  The fans may have a right to know, mainly how foiolish they have been to revere an empty vessel.  A doctor has a special place in society, and like a sportsman found guilty of 'bringing their sport into disrepute' can be accused of the same if they transgress.  The doctor, like the footballer, has used the reputation of their profession to buld thier own, and if they have betrayed the values of medicine, they do not deserve to hide behind a judge - who must hold up their own professional and personal standards, or face public dishonour.

Considering the position of women in medical training - and lets not forget that over half of medical students and doctors in training are female, and will face this - the reports says,""Any indirect adverse effect on women is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.""  That might be an expression of the politics of changing the NHS, but the report goes on to say, ""Whilst this may disadvantage lone parents (who are disproportionately female) due to the increased cost of paid childcare in the evenings and weekend, in some cases this may actually benefit other women, for example where individuals have partners, it may be easier to make informal, unpaid childcare arrangements in the evenings and weekends than it is during the week due to the increased availability of partners and wider family networks at weekends and in the evenings.""

1546	342	1	As I follow it , in the sex discriminatory argument (refuted by the Dept of Health) it was argued that week-end working was discriminatory against women because these may be single parents etc... An argument frequently used in other contexts. The implication being that women should not be obliged to work week-ends or be paid more for so doing. Presumably too this applies to any out-of-hours work. An extrapolation of this argument might be that Jewish doctors be excused Saturday work , Christians for Sundays etc... to avoid religious discrimination.

The point remains that if we are to see women disadvantaged by having to do out-of-hours work , then that has major implications for their training and possibly for their career prospects. Since this disadvantage is seen as a matter of principle , it cannot be corrected by financial adjustment.   Besides , in training perhaps the ends can sometimes justify the means - my working long and antisocial hours (the means) to some extent justified the ends (a career in the specialty of my choice)..

1549	343	1	"A 30 year old woman who has requested sterilisation for the past five years has now been told she can have the procedure undertaken soon. In an interesting case she says her GP has denied her the right to sterilisation because she might regret it. Last year she said :      'For the record, the reason I dont want children is both simple and complex. I just dont want them. I never have. You could perhaps attribute this to the fact that my mum actually had a sterilisation after I was born, but was talked into having a reversal and three more children by the man she married after my dad, since he didnt have any of his own. She loves us, of course, but her energy and finances have been drained for more than 30 years by children. I dont regret any of you, she says often, but what you dont have you dont miss. Ive explained all this and more to the doctors Ive asked to sterilise me. When theyve talked about the fulfilment that children bring, Ive explained that I already have a longer list of things I want to do than I could possibly achieve in a lifetime. When theyve told me Ill feel differently when I find the one, Ive explained that my one wouldnt want kids either  and that Id want to focus on being their partner, not the mother of their children. When theyve casually called me selfish  more than once  Ive explained that Im a blood donor, an organ donor, a bone marrow donor, and even tried to give my unwanted eggs to childless couples  only to be told theyre not suitable because Im a carrier for cystic fibrosis. Even this didnt sway them. Reason after solid reason, and still theyve rejected me every year since the age of 26. What are the magic words I need to say to convince a GP that this really is what I want? Every year for the last four years my GP has refused my decision. I couldn't even get a referral. The response was always: ""Youre far too young to take such a drastic decision.""'      I can understand her GP would want to ensure she made an informed decision but is it right to deny her the procedure if she is determined it is what she wants? I find myself supporting the patient in this case. She certainly might regret the procedure in the future but one can regret many things in life. Despite being sterilised she might still be able to have a child further down the line if a reversal is successful. No guarantees either way.     http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3509131/Campaigner-Holly-Brockwell-wins-right-sterilised-NHS-four-year-battle-prove-NEVER-wants-children.html      Kirked-qp0ey4dda76b8ev12136ftdaqa0lo72dtb7p1e5boj1c9a5c0hm6b5a5a7f6bt1lza1c2czrn6vib01a6a38s0k3"	kirked	25/3/2016 11:11 AM	0	0

1552	343	1	I heard this lady telling her story on the radio, and she argues well for her PoV.  I fear that the attitude of gynae surgeons is biased by their experience of people, men and women, who get sterilised and then regret it, often because the operation was a part of marital breakdown and with new partners fertility is wanted again. Surgeons always insist that steriliation must be considered permanent, which is what this woman wants, but their mind set is fixed on fickle human nature.I can't quote the success ratio of reconstructions, but it's not great, and no one likes to say 'my surgery is unlikely to be sucessful'.   And, female sterilisation always needs general anaesthesia, which cannot be undertaken lightly.  In the interview, she said that her long term male partner had been offered vasectomy, under LA with lesser risk, but that was not acceptable. She didn't explain why.

1553	343	1	Many thanks all,   I think when talking of 'Doctors' she is referring to General Practitioners. The newspaper article I linked is just a few days old and seems to indicate her dissatisfaction with the attitudes of different GP's she has consulted. She is clearly an intelligent, well informed patient who is categorical about her wish for sterilisation having fully understood that tubal ligation should be regarded as irreversible. As far as I ascertain from the article she is in a long term relationship with a young man who doesn't wish to have a vasectomy and she does not wish to use hormonal medication to render her unable to conceive.   I think Maxim highlights an important point. Would it not have been proper for her GP to say to the patient 'whilst I am reluctant to support you in securing sterilisation because you are too young and may very well regret such a decision I will refer you to my colleague who might be more willing to assist you'. If she decided to be sterilised privately would she still require her GP's referral?   Kirked	kirked	28/3/2016 7:28 AM	0	0
1554	343	1	I hope GPS will forgive me but their role is often as 'gatekeeper' to hospital services. So delegation to those specialists may be felt to be dodging their responsi abilities.   If her partner was unwilling to consider vasectomy then they must take responsibilty for the problem too. Vasectomy is easily tolerated and done under LA. Reversal takes much longer and GA is preferred. Either operation is minor in terms of stress and risk, being entirely external and to superficial structures.  When his partner was as definite and determined, why was he not willing to u dergo this trivial procedure?   John-v5p1myb9b6	John D	28/3/2016 8:35 AM	0	0
1555	343	1	Certainly the world is full of people who knew totally 100% what they wanted until they  didnt   The death risk from the GA/Lap sterilisation is low but not zero. The male having a vasectomy could be killed by a meteorite but it remains a safer procedure . Mirena insertion takes usually 2-3 minutes of doctor time plus does have to be repeated every five years and could be a bit of a nuisance for some.   Beyond age 30 is usually enough for most guidelines to consider TL. The coroner would certainly question why a tubal ligation was allowed if there was a disaster in a younger person (The vasectomy refuser may also rethink things)   .A private opinion would be routine if public hospital guidelines are not met.-82s0d3cze2b1ixa7	rcdeacon	30/3/2016 6:55 PM	0	0

1559	344	1	"The Junior Doctors will go out on strike next month, from emergency work as well as routine.  No doubt the consultants will be there to maintain emergency services, and I doubt if any doctor will call them blacklegs for doing so. (For anyone not steeped in UK social history, a blackleg is one who works while others are on strike)   But what about recently retired doctors, especially those who still work part-time?  Should they agree if asked, or even offer to work, to support their erstwhile colleaguesand the even harder-pressed service, while their junior ex-colleagues are the strikers?   The ethics would seem to be the same as a doctor faced with a street accident. She has no duty of care to the casualty and must not profess an expertise she does not have.   If she does volunteer she must exert the same diligence as for any other patient, within the resources available whihc may be limited.  So there is no need to do so.   It may be argued that it is in the interest of the Juniors struggle to prevent any emergency patient sufferiing mishap due to the strike, so on that ground should our protagonist volunteer? Equally, a strike's intention is to damage the employer's profits, of which there are none in the NHS, so perhaps the credibility, the reputation of the employer, as a reliable provider of the service? So if there are queues of bleeding, chest clutching patient outside hospitals, will that not also further the Junior's case?    I fear not; several right wing newspapers are already getting the knife in: The Sun, ""champagn swilling lavish lifestyles enjoyed by striking ""Moet-Medics"""" ;Daily Mail ""strike could close A&E departments"". The dispute will win or lose on the support of the public - if they think that their immedaute safety is threatened, they will lose all support fior the Juniors.

1560	344	1	I have been thinking through this one as well. Although not now in a position to return to work , I am fairly sure i would have done so if asked. Striking over emergencies is not a good tactic - even though some 80% of those attending A&E may not be emergencies in the true sense. Will doctors really refuse to see and help for true emergencies ? Many years ago I recall very senior managers pushing for cross cover at a junior level on the grounds that a doctor is a doctor , so eg paediatrics could be covered by the general medicine team etc... Later on of course there was the pressure for a consultant based service , but many of those now having to stand in may not feel at home in the hustle and bustle of A&E outside their specialty. Cover may be provided but not at all A&E departments. Besides there will be folk out there who may refuse to work outside contracted hours although I expect there is a clause about the exigencies of the service etc...   The rosy view of the public that when the crunch comes doctors would not walk out on emergencies is about to be broken and that is bad news. It is not just the right wing press that is pointing out pay rates . In the little Independent to-day the point is made that juniors may be being paid up to 70K. Merely pointing this out emphasises the view that this is now a tussle over money.   John D - If you do go back to work and see it reasonable to give an anaesthetic to help a child have a broken leg treated etc... you would have my support. Not that that is worth much these days....-zt5b51	sken	24/3/2016 8:13 PM	0	0
1561	344	1	Thank you, sken! For your support, and your thoughts.   I think that I will wait and see. If an ex-colleague asks me to help, I'll go like a shot.  If a manager asks, I'll see if those ex-colleagues 'approve' that the request is genuine.  My reasons are those that I discussed last - better that I go, rather than a junior, or that the patient suffers, because that would be gold dust to the press and Hunt.   Juniors may earn 70K - consultants may earn nearly 200K.  Few do, although they can be typified by the press.   I hope that local discussions are taking place on priorities and definitions. I read that juniors are suspicous that managers will call anything up to a Major Incident to get them back in, and what about the 'urgents', the cancers?   If they lose out we are lost, politically. And those in A&E with sore toes - will they be redirected to their GPs? I do not fancy being a GP then - they will be snowed under, as if they weren't already.

1562	344	1	John   It might be interesting to hear the views of somejunior doctors who would be involved in the next strike; I'm not sure if you've asked any outside this thread. I've not heard any of the juniors expressing viewseither wayabout current or retired Consultants doing what would usually be done by juniors.   If your offering or agreeing to help out is purely in the spirit of preventing harm coming to patients and is done without any comment on the ethics of striking I would be surprised if you came in for any seriouscriticism.   I doubt that Consultants would strike because offorthcoming changes to their contractsbut if that did happen in any numberstheremight bea considerableadded problem of somejuniors not being able to work eitherbecause they would beunsupervised.   Tabloid arguments about what some juniors can earnseem to me to be irrelevant and are best ignored as far as possible. I would have to take a similar attitude to mentions of tabloid (can't remember which) claims about eye-watering hourly rates of pay for some GPs working in A/E to help the crises there.   This presumably comes down to who will blink first.As you hint in another recentthread,JHcould well be increasinglyunder pressure.I don't know about whiskey and revolver; enough rope could be enough.

1563	345	1	"Sir Bruce Keogh, whose review of weekend mortality in the NHS many believe was hijacked by Hunt to back the Tory's political wish for a 7/7 NHS, spoke at a meeting at Guy's Campus.  He said thatthere was ""good clinical consensus among all doctors for a 7/7 NHS but that, where this became derailed was when the seven-day services was loosely linked in some way to a discussion about junior doctors.He said that,Where it did need a focus on people was primarily around consultant support  It appears that he meant by that more consultants in the hospital at weekends, rather than more support staff in paramedical services, the other criticism of the Hunt approach.  But with the criticism of such emininents as Sir Bruce chipping away, can Hunt long survive?  The Tory's Budget is falling about their ears and Ian Duncan Smith has fallen on his sword.

1564	346	1	This was a question at my latest pre-anaesthetic assessment recently. I presumed there was some other point behind the question other than provincial prejudices of anaesthetists in the South. What was unclear was just what infection was being chased - the extremely high incidence of hep C in Manchester ? Their problems with respitratory viruses? Last year's scare about Ebola? When I think about the questions that could have been asked this one intrigued me .   DOI All my immediate forebears come from that neck-of-the woods.   PS John D - it really is time that anaesthetists pushed themselves into a proper role of clinical importance and not just act as surgical accessories , albeit highly skilled. I will only find out who is anaesthetising me just before surgery. For me the individual is always potentially just as important as the surgeon and what anxieties I have relate to the anaesthesia not to what the surgeon may do or find , although I am aware of the implications. Particularly relevant as I have postponed surgery largely because I did not want to be just told I would have another spinal (bad trip last time) and specified a GA . I see it as so relevant that it even influences my choice of hospital - stymied because the hospital I would have chosen , with 2 anaesthetists of choice , has just closed and the other chap I would have wanted has retired......-3p0b	sken	12/3/2016 2:57 PM	0	0
1565	346	1	"Sken,   I didn't ignore you, really I didn't. I wrote a thoughtful, insightful piece, reflecting on the role of the anaesthetist and how it has developed from a part-time novelty to a full specialty that almost no other specialty can do without. And my cursed computer lost it!  I must have pressed the wrong keys - I have a newish keyboard and sometimes (I think) I press the control key by mistake.   The Microsoft equivalent of Tutankhamen's Curse, the CTRL codes, take over and do things that were never asked.  So my deathless prose is lost, and I can't bear to try and recreate it, sorry!   But I used to run an Anaesthesia Clinic.  Its constituency was the Pre-Op. Assessment Clinic, and the occasional direct surgical or even GP referral, and its role was to assess and advise people who faced high risks from surgery.  To do them justice, and because often ""no surgery"" was an option to be considered, I saw six to eight patients in one sessioneach week.   I hope, and believe from feedback, that those people were often grateful for this service.   So, if you want to have a good chat with an anaesthetist before surgery, and don't mind if it's not actually your anaesthetist, tell the POA nurses all about your dreadful chest pain, previous strokes (and miraculous recovery), airway problems at previous anaesthetics and family history of malignant hyperpyrexia.  An appointment in the Anaesthesia Clinic will follow!   John-it1b8jb6jb7isf9hb9jlb32"	John D	15/3/2016 10:54 PM	0	0
1566	346	1	"John D - thanks. My recent experience (yesterday) with an anaesthetist was much more pleasant than the previous one. He even smiled from time to time and called in later to see how I was faring.... My impression is that the specialty includes a gamut from the primarily technician through the ""human"" and so on to those who eventually move to pain relief and pain clinics.   In gastroenterology we have 'scope pushers and listeners at the 2 ends of the spectrum. I think most of us aimed for a middle road - and have passed much of the routine 'scope work over to nursing colleagues - and where funds are available quite a bit of the listening as well.   I remember hearing about a study at St T's a couple of years ago where all those (I think 65+) were admitted for a 1/2 day for full assessment. I remember thinking that I did not want to go a place that could not bring common sense into the equation and was so dismissive that some of us might have better things to do - I can't remember just how many , if any ,of the significant findings were found in low risk patients..   Very sorry about the computer - you are not alone in such mishaps - but many thanks for responding.

One example is Saludcoop, a name that for many people in Colombia is the synonym of a 'corrupted EPS', several reports of illegal practices by this insurer had motivated the intervention by the Colombian authorities, the company is currently under a liquidation process due to their growing debt.   A lawyer responsible for the liquidation of Saludcoopwas recently incriminated in a conversation involving a kickback to another unionist (also a lawyer) affiliated to Unitracoop(union of workers of Saludcoop and other EPSs). The purpose of the kickback was to avoid any problems in the liquidation of this infamous EPS.

1580	350	1	You may have followed the thread in which a novelist asked for advice about how a GP would manage an unusual case, so that he could write convincingly the plot of his latest story.   D2D members responded willingly, and the author said he found their advice useful.  I hope we can do the same if other requests arrive.   This was an experiment, an unplanned one,as the author came to the D2D board without being asked to do so.  It at first seemed risky; we routinely reject, politely, similar requests for online diagnosis and advice from patients, but this was a different situation. It might be described as medical outreach, to another discipline entirely. Could the 'faculty' of D2D do the same for others?  Could we help, say, civil engineers or architects?   D2D is open for suggestions, not only of who else we might help, but how to offer that help.   John-70wb8fb5nb1n1c8	John D	29/1/2016 11:19 AM	0	0

1582	350	1	Interesting idea John.   Perhaps it would be most useful as a collaborative approach whereby we see what we could learn from each other. Personally, I believe that Medicine has an awful lot to learn from other disciplines and professions eg:   Musicians: how to learn and practice skills in the most effective ways.   Engineers: how to design things so that they are more likely to work than to fail (with notable exceptions!)   Artist and writers: how to see things in different ways and to understand nuances of behaviour.   Teachers: how to educate and assess.   As far as what we can offer other groups (I hesitate to call them profession or discipline), maybe we could reach out to management consultants. We could suggest that theystop pretending (for large fees) thatthey know what you're talking about in the Health Service.   But thebunch orswarmto invite first might be politicians. The problem would be the inseparability of offeringtechnical advice from dealing withtheir personal problems of disordered thinking and dissembling.

1583	350	1	"I think this need for interaction has long been recognised. When I was working at the Clinical Research Centre at Harrow back in the 1970s the aim was to have folk from different backgrounds - including Heinz Wolff and bioengineering - interacting from the viewpoint of different disciplines. Exposure to those with an interest in sports and music as well as literature has featured throughout much of my life. As a DGH physician there was also a group that met regularly with those from the University to look at ways in which different scientific departments could interact with hospital departments. Clearly there were financial incentives for the non-medical groups.in such research projects in terms of obtaining funding..   Any forum that encourages such interaction is to be welcomed. I do not think this needs to be just at the levels of ""experts"" - some of the more relevant ideas which need exploring or where the opportunities for interaction may be most profitable could well come from those in the fromt line. Perhaps doc2doc should also register /flag up that a number of medics also have degrees in eg physics or highly specialised interests such as musicians and their occuaptional problems.

I personally like to have everything all in one place so Id prefer if the BMJ commeng came into d2d rather than them having their own seperately site (I like only having to keep an eye on one website)      My concern of moving to an exclusive comments on stories in the BMJ style is that it would restrict our topics to those covered in the journal. Many of the discussions on D2D (esp those I tend to engage more with) are based on news articles, items from other journals, new guidelines, clinical problems & life / career advice. Tying D2D more strongly into the BMJ website would cut out much of this.   I don't mind suggestions on what I've previously liked or commented on (not just read as i often open a page, read a few lines to get the gist then realise it's not for me). As you can only see the 10 most recent posts sometimes you miss out on a topic oh might be interested in if you've been away for a day.   It would be nice to unfollow a topic to stop it appearing in the recent discussions widget. For example... There might be a few popular discussions about an adult topics which are all active & so taking up several of the spaces in the recent discussions. Can I click that I'm not interested in that and it then disappears (& doesn't return) from the widget so I can see new things I might like (like when you leave a discussion in Facebook to stop getting all the notifications about it)   The doc2doc search has always been unreliable. Perhaps a keywords system where people can nominate upto 5 keywords would help simple searching. I might tag my recent returning to work discussion with ""maternity, return to work, advice, career, family"", whereas a ""hardcore"" clinical paper could use the article MESH keywords. Visitors could then be offered a ""popular discussions"" word cloud to see hot topics on search for particular terms.   If people are discussing an article from BMJ group (not just BMJ but ADC etc) perhaps an option to auto link the abstract into the opening post with link to the journal (I read an article online, want to discuss, click ""discuss"" and the widardry takes me to an open discussion if there is one, or using a template starts one with the abstract already in which then appears on D2D). You can then have 2 recent discussion widgets: ""from the journals"" and ""freelance"" (or whatever catchy name suits those that aren't discussing articles).      for those articles from journals, the ability to link those articles & your participation into your BMJ learning portfolio (or even better my NHS eportfolio) so I can quickly & easily link ""I've read this & actively discussed it"" for my portfolio   and finically can we PLEASE get the mobile site fixed so I can view it with my phone portrait, Its the only site I have to view & use landscape as its not resizeable and the discussion column doesn't fit in portrait!   hope that's some ideas to be getting on with!

1590	351	1	My responses:   1. I would not like for do2doc to be more clsoely tied to the BMJ contnents. The wide scipe of posts are a unique feature of doc2doc. Instant comments on articles are available at the BMJ and need not be duplicated on doc2doc.   2. i really like the sense of community of the posts on doc2doc and the wide scope of the posts. i particularly like the posts on some of the social/entical issues of medical practice and the attempts to improve health care. i am always disapointed in the low number of responses compared to the number of views. Any attempts to increase the number of responses would be welcomed. A more vigorous feedback function might be helpful tied not just to responses to my posts, but also new posts in an area that i have an interest in.   3. There have been times when the fora have been captured by a few individuals whit posts of marginal import. There also have been some posts that are commercial in contennt. however, this comes with the teritory and the level of policing appears about right.   4. Severalhave mentioned a more robust surch function. i think that rather than new features, i would prefer looking at the current fora and see if they meet the needs of our readers. New fora on early aspects of a medical career come to midn. also more esplicit fora to discuss social and ethical sapects of medicine would be interesting.   5. An interesting idea. it mihgt increase interaction among those with common interests.-so2b4cxcxf8d7fwd4c9h9dzc0e7b5hqc6	diabetesMD	31/8/2015 7:52 AM	0	0
1591	351	1	I do not believe that doc2doc website is a sister website of bmj.com.Its search engine is very poor I usually seek help from Google.The last technical glitch took more than 48 hours to restore the system.When an unwanted ad is placed on the page then it remains there for the whole day.Sometimes back I inquired about one of my old posts I was told that all old posts have been deleted.Sometimes very intelligent questions are asked by clinicians and non-medical personnels ----------in such cases the editors must extend their helping hand in looking for the answer.-ob568	Mukhtar Ali	31/8/2015 4:27 PM	0	0
1592	351	1	"A thought that i had last night in terms of making doc2doc more interactive and meaningful to our readers is the development of an ""Ask the clinician"" forum. In this forum practitioners, students and trainees would have a site for their clinical questions. The site would then have the capability to calorize the question by looking at key words and the question would be forwarded to one of our volunteer content experts for a response. An example might be: What would be your next choice of oral agents in a type 2 diabetic patient when metformin and a sulfonylurea failed to adequately control the glycemia?"" The question would be forwarded to a resident diabetes expert for response and any reader could see the question and response(s). This would require a robust program to identify the topics and send a notification to the expert for a response. However, it would certainly be a great way to be of service to our readers and to foster a sense of community.-ymzxeviyg4ezet75148"	diabetesMD	1/9/2015 4:03 AM	1	0

1597	352	1	Yes, I know, sken, posting at any length is not helped by the lack here of a decent spell checker or many other functions that we have grown to know and love from word processing.  But if I may suggest, write your detailed posts in Word, or else 'Copy' your post into Word?  All will then be available, spellchecker, Uncle Tom Word Finder 'n all and you can copy your pristine prose back into a post at the end.

1599	353	1	2 contrasting comments in the past few days. Firstly , Maureen Baker of the RCGP It is deeply insulting and demeaning as well as being highly unethical  to suggest that offering GPs money will change the way in which we care for our patients. Money has featured greatly , and often for the good, in the way GPs care for their patients. Contracts have been negotiated on that basis. The precipitant  possible payments for not referring to hospital  is not something for such a self righteous response but for information and audit on the inappropriateness of referrals. If this is happening - then why : poor guidelines , more training needed , complaining patients always seen as in the right etc...      The second full feature article by a GP in the Guardian / Observer was against the evils of private practice. Totally different from GPs : hospital doctors do things because of the money. The evils listed will be well known to many of us and it is time we tackled them more forcefully but not on a doctrinal basis. No mention of the frustration of some doctors when they are discouraged from seeing patients on the NHS even by running unpaid extra clinics. No mention of using private sessions to raise money to improve services for all patients etc And the usual issue about whether a UK taxpayer should lose rights to NHS services if seen privately. It has never been so crucial to try to establish an ethical way in which the MHS and private sectors can compliment each other  my impression is that it happens already more often than we realise.      Both systems have evils which we need to tackle (it is not a problem of recognition)  but doctors are not influenced by money -7j8bl90bmsxjk58279b8a2uwby4b4pgf148cgxbj65apma	sken	5/10/2015 11:59 AM	0	0
1600	353	1	Thnak you sken, for having jogged my memory of your post about this!   And for the clue to trace the Guardian article to one by Gavin Francis last month. It's worth reading, as it raises several points about the way that private practice, when alongside a health service such as the NHS, inevitably (?) leaches on those resources, to its own advantage and profit.     See:http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/02/profit-not-patients-risks-private-medicine   John-7imb80aba	John D	8/11/2015 10:52 AM	0	0
1601	353	1	I have no objection to people who wish to avail themselves of private facilities to do so. But, there should be a clear demarcation between NHS and private facilities and services. Likewise I do not see why a Doctor cannot clearly separate his NHS practice and private patients. As the article alludes to if he does not, then inevitably it leads to abuses of NHS facilities. But my real concern is safety and openness in private hospitals. So little is known about their safety records.      There are about 1.61 million admissions annually to private hospitals and they are generally 'low risk' for surgery. Yet little is known about such hospitals performance data because unlike NHS trusts they do not have to supply it even though they do have CQC inspections. Private hospitals now receive about 28% of their income from treating NHS patients and around 6000 private patients a year are treated in NHS hospitals following complications from surgery in private hospitals. Between October 2010 and April 2014 802 unexpected deaths and 921 serious injuries were reported by private hospitals.      Can prospective patients make an informed judgement about whether to undergo surgery in a private hospital if they know very little about its facilities (such as Doctors immediately available in emergencies, critical care responses etc)? I wonder how many patients undergoing surgery are aware that if they develop complications overnight almost certainly an ambulance will be called to take them to the nearest A&E department. If NHS patients do have problems relating to surgery in private hospitals who do they address those concerns to? Where does the buck stop? It really isn't very clear. It is clear becoming a major issue because a group of lawyers have emerged specialising in medical negligence occurring in private hospitals. One major difference is that patients in private hospitals do have a contract with their Doctor in a private hospital whereas NHS patients do not. Suing for breach of contract can, therefore be undertaken.      The info here I have taken from The Centre for Health and the Public Interest report 2014 (the known and the unknown risks). It is a very helpful insight into Private hospitals gleaned by Freedom of Information Requests. It is about the only report I can think of which sheds some light on safety issues in private hospitals :     http://chpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CHPI-PatientSafety-Aug2014.pdf      Kirked-p48d7wd26grjx	kirked	9/11/2015 11:51 AM	0	0
1602	353	1	Thank you, Kirked!  That report should be read by all who take part in private practice.   It argues correctly that private hospitlas hould have to provide the same evidence of competence, good governnace and clinical effectiveness as the NHS, and I agree with you that consultants in PP should maintain a a clear seperation between their two practices, and find some way to work with colleagues, to avoid isolation.  To that end, I recommend the Group Practice, which as an anaesthetist has many advantages, so many that I cannot understand why those in surgical specialties seem to be unable to achieve it.   Not only does it ensure independance from the NHS, as it allows you to work only when you have no NHS commitments, it answers any demand to work at another time, or when you are on leave, as a colleague can take up the work to no detriment to yourself. While it is right to be responsible for your patients post-op. perhaps overnight, it makes covering complications on the subsequent day or later easier and more expeditious, as a colleague will be in the hospital and can do so on your behalf.   In a Group of sufficient size, it can offer to provide all clinical services in your specialty to the private hospital, giving the Group a lever in collective bargaining that an individual cannot.  And a Group member behaving anomalously is more likely to be commented on to a fellow Group member.    John-j80b1o8bb06b7hb2rb4h	John D	9/11/2015 10:40 PM	0	0
1603	353	1	"kirked - I too found this report very interesting. Most of the recommendations seem fairly straightforward but clearly better data is needed in the NHS as well. There is for example a world of difference between a transfer of an NHS patient having a routine operation in a private hospital who needs transfer for an unexpected problem for emergency reasons and one who is transferred for a relatively minor matter. After all even NHS hospitals taking emergencies may have to transfer patients for specialist services. Similarly those seen as private patients should not lose their NHS ""rights"" if emergencies arise.   Just how one overcomes the problem of complications from inappropriate surgery is unclear. It will become an increasing problem as the NHS tightens its indications for some procedures - not meaning that the procedure is unnecessary but because of needing to limit costs and because of pressures on facilities. Currently there is clearly a tendency at times to operate more readily in the private sector and if these patients then require emergency transfer they are to some extent ""gatecrashing"" the NHS. Equally , I had a private THR replacement recently for end stage disease - was told I should have had it done years ago - and was offered an NHS bed. The medical reasons for preferring to go privately were to ensure that the surgeon of choice did the operation. He works with a particular anaesthetist (not just allocated one from the group rota) . I also had a preference for a smaller unit without intensive throughput with increased risks of cross infection. My first choice hospital would have been a designated orthopaedic hospital which accepts many NHS patients but was just a bit too far away. It would of course have had all the drawbacks of limited back-up on site. Some might argue that hospitals of this type still have a very real part to play in the NHS and we need to be clear whether our prejudices are against specialist units or against the private sector.   I also happened to prefer a system where my notes were not necessarily put into the ownership of the hospital to be disseminated or sold on as felt fit but that is a wider issue.   I fully understood and accepted that if things went very wrong then I would be at a disadvantage , but then my advance decision rejects much of what modern medicine obliges doctors to do by way of resus.. The lack of on site back-up junior staff is a major problem and I accept that my own knowledge has proved pretty useful during 2 admissions in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. But the same might have applied in an NHS hospital. I shudder to think about what might happen without some insider knowledge....   The crucial area not adequately assessed in the report is in the quality of nursing services. These are a major concern in both NHS and private sectors. I had the impression that the private sector is less reliant on agency staff but that increasingly nursing procedures in both sectors are more worrying than what is happening medically. It is after all the ward nurses who will be the first to pick up on something going amiss and if there is a lack of understanding then that might be a cause for significant complication.   Caveat emptor seems very relevant but a leaflet on the main pros and cons for those being admitted would seem feasible as part of consent. But the final decision might well be made on availibility of treatment for elective surgery and for social reasons eg a preference for a n open ward of side-room..-x27ghgz"	sken	10/11/2015 11:40 AM	0	0
1604	353	1	PS Those who feel that emergency NHS transfer from the private sector is inappropriate are I think on tricky ground - think the scenario of a patient being mobilised in the private sector who falls and breaks a leg or the patiient who has a PE soon after going home. Would one really argue that these patients should be denied NHS care? I cannot see that it will be posible to make a rule that where there is emergency need , patients would be turned away from the NHS back-up hospital. It would put the staff there in a pretty difficult position.   At the other extreme are the non-emergency problems - such as an unsightly scar or inappropriate cosmetic surgery - arising from an operation carried out privately. Again where this is adjudged appropriate , NHS care seems OK - after all we would not refuse to treat someone with equally self-inflicted damage in other ways. What should be demonstrable is that there is no preferential NHS treatment or inappropriateiate pressures to do just that. The NHS needs to provide information on these issues - and perhaps we need to know about those examples where the private sector has bailed out the NHS.....-rx4	sken	10/11/2015 1:30 PM	0	0
1605	353	1	I am delighted that sken had the surgeon and anesthetist of his choice, but may I correct (?), modify perhaps what he said about the latter 'being allocated from the Group rota'.   In my Group we have a rota, of course we do, so that the private hospital theatre and the surgeon know who will be there. But it is a routine rota, in which a surgeon and an anaesthetist work regularly together as a team, interrupted only by their leave, not a random allocation. Thsi may be more regular than in the NHS!  I believe that in my Department, buffeted by other rotas such as pain, Intensive and obstetric care, it is a minority of anaesthetists who have the same surgeon every week.   A Group provides for the replacement for a principal on leave or sick to be also known to the other clinician, as there are only so many sessions in the working week when an NHS consultant is free to take up some private work. That is a great benefit, as the pressure to skive off and do a few cases at the Golden Brick isn't there - a colleague is doing it with no loss to the NHS, and the proceeds are shared. So the alternates who can cover absences are limited, and you tend to work with the same other surgeon regularly too.   Group Practice is so good for the NHS that it should be the rule in any specialty with sufficient consultants.   John-h48ab7j0gsbb61b9	John D	10/11/2015 5:06 PM	0	0
1606	353	1	Many thanks sken,   I agree with you that patients should not in any way be penalised for requiring emergency admission to NHS hospitals after private hospital surgery. But I feel it is wrong that patients undergoing relatively routine surgery in private hospitals do not appear to be aware that complications stemming from the surgery may not be dealt with safely in the hospital they are in. As a lay person it is easy to assume that a hospital is a hospital and appropriately qualified and experienced Doctors are always available to identify problems and respond quickly to them. When in reality it may be that the patient is essentially in the same position as if they were suddenly taken unwell at home.   There should be minimum safeguards in place that caters for the type of surgery undertaken. Many private facilities do not have a CRASH team at all and the RMO may well be a locum who has no anaesthetic, surgical or even acute medicine education or training.   A friend of mine is the Senior Nurse of a private hospital in London that is most certainly at the top of the range of private healthcare. They have very strong links to a large prestigious University hospital and medical school and have superb facilities including ITU, CCU, HDU and recovery. I visited to see for myself the services offered and would have no qualms about undergoing major surgery there. If wealthy people use such services they most certainly get a first class experience and senior surgeons undertake ward rounds with a full junior team each day. I noted also that there are rarely nursing vacancies because nurses regard employment there as very prestigious. The nurses are highly experienced, have excellent post grad qualifications and are paid well. The ones I spoke to regarded it as in another league to the usual private hospitals. They utilise their skills in an acute care setting and have the added benefit of good staffing levels, access to further training, strong links to the NHS and good in organisation advancement prospects.   Your point about nursing in private hospitals is very important indeed. Invariably nurses pick up problems (or should) as they develop on wards because they are the ones with the patients most of the time. Their reaction to initial problems may define the outcome. Again the average lay person probably does not realise that nurses skills and abilities can vary widely.   For me the key message here is that it is only just that prospective patients should be able to make informed judgements about undergoing private hospital surgery. I would not like to see private facilities close. They provide a perfectly fair service to the market and why should people not be able to have particular surgery at a more convenient time for them? It is the hybrid system that concerns me. NHS patients should not be penalised because Surgeons abuse NHS facilities.   kirked-jy1	kirked	11/11/2015 11:43 AM	0	0
1607	353	1	"kirked - Just what should be explained to patients - many private hospitals have fewer than 30 beds , so back up services are bound to be limited ; side rooms will not be subject to the same level of observation , so ""collapse"" is less likely to be noticed immediately ; the consultants concerned will have their major commitment elsewhere so will not be available on demand ; the hospitals are run for profit so corners will be cut ; resident doctors are unlikely to have the same level of skill and training as those doing more sought after jobs in NHS hospitals.   Anything in that lot that is not self-evident ? Anyone who has had any contact with any form of the news media in the past 5 years will surely not believe ""a hospital is a hospital"". As with trust in the integrity of doctors and competence of hospitals people persist in their beliefs (and possibly including religion) because they cannot cope with the alternative.   For those undergoing the usual run of routine operations , the consent form and information leaflet already include list of the main likely complications - I had mine long before admission - and all patients have to do is to ask the ""what if "" question. As happened often enough when I consented patients in the NHS.   Now there will be folk who believe that if you pay for something it will be better than if it is free - but that is a Society problem and medical care is perhaps little different from other aspects of consumerism - in this respect at least. All I would ask is that people ask the same questions as they might if eg buying a car or a washing machine and asking about back-up , warranties etc... People are quite capable of this and perhaps we should stop pretending it is always our medical responsibility to go into the detail. But make sure they have the opportunity to ask the questions.-9w2cxky"	sken	11/11/2015 1:12 PM	0	0
1608	353	1	Kirked, Sken,   There must be many, if not all Trusts wherethe hospitals in the group are all independently capableof dealing with all likely complications. They will all have smaller or more remote units where patient selection must be exerted to reduce the complication rate to a minimum and where arrangements must be in place for transfer if necessary. If the smallest, which includes many private hospitals, take similar precautions, where do you draw the line below which no unit deserves the title 'hospital'?   And Sken, do you really think that the public are that discerning about the status and capability of different hospitals, or even that they should? How many public campaigns have been fought to keep small, uneconomic and in your terms unsafe hospitals open, just because they are the local 'hospital'? The public is far more concerned about proximity and ease of visiting than clinical prowess and resources. That is ajustifiable concern , and one that should be addressed by the civic authorities, while hospital standards should be the responsibility of medical authorities. Both reporting to the Government, national or local, so as to be answerable to the public in a democracy.   John-cw5a9b0ba4raa42aaa8maa1iaaak2n	John D	12/11/2015 3:51 PM	0	0
