Question: "lumbar sciatica right, scoliosis. Prolapse?"  You see initially two CT images of the lumbar spine. After consultation with the orthopedists a CT of the bony pelvis was carried out. The reason was an unexpected finding in the right ilium.       Shortly later an MRI using CM of the pelvis was performed.

Condition following cholecystectomy 2015.  Currently again present in hospital due to uncontrolled hypertension. Ultrasound shows unclear lesion to the right alongside gallbladder bed.  A 3-phase CT was carried out in peripheral hospital. The finding states among other things: "... for  comparison purposes there are several other images present ... Newly occurred alongside the former gallbladder bed is a hypodense alteration of 15 x 24 mm in size, relatively unsharply defined border, unclear tumour ... "       With this patient an MRI of the upper abdomen was also carried out in addition to the above CT findings in order to clarify uncertainty regarding the liver lesion. The sequences used are indicated.

4b14a9a73d4af6ea1acd11dd49e34af02f0c609e	A 30 years old female with severe sinus node dysfunction manifestating for months after delivery	http://www.doccheck.com/com/ask/question/view/id/593588/	14.09.2016	Deleted user	Physician	female, 30 years, Smoker: No  I would like to discuss an interesting case from our University Clinic which focuses on a 30 years old female patient who was admitted to our Heart Rhythm department because of dizziness, and episodes of loss of consciousness. Holter monitoring have revealed severe sinus pauses at night and in the morning up to 6 seconds. The symptoms started just after she gave birth to her first baby 6 months ago.     Complaints: there were two episodes when the patient woke up in her bed and found out she urinated in the bed while sleeping, she lost her consciousness twice in the morning. She feels dizzy when she gets up to feed her baby at night.     Anamnesis morbi: The patient was feeling fine prior delivery. Her pregnancy period was uncomplicated, she was feeling good during the whole pregnancy and gave birth without surgical intervention. The symptoms started just after the delivery. Because of fainting she was consulted by neurologist, EEG was performed with no epileptic activity. She was finally consulted by a cardiologist and Holter monitoring was done, which revealed high grade sinus dysfunction with sinus pauses up to 6 seconds.     Anamnesis vitae  The patient was suffering anaemia of unknown origin at her childhood (3 years old) and had 4 erythrocyte transfusions.  20 years later she was diagnosed with hepatitis C (source was believed to be the transfusions in her childhood). She was treated with Ribavirinum and Interferonum. She was not feeling well during the treatment, she had some side effects like nausea, loss of some hair, weakness. No copies of HCV RNR are found in her blood for now. She is in remission of hepatitis C.  No other medical history     Status presens  Nothing special     Instrumental testing:  ECG – sinus arrhythmia, PQ, QTC, normal.  Holter monitoring – episodes of sinus bradycardia with sinus pauses up to 6 seconds  2D echocardiography - normal  Cardiac MRI – normal heart morphology    Serology for Borrelia Burgdorferi Igm and IgG negative  All liver enzymes at normal values,  CBC – normal  High sensitivity troponin – normal  CRP – normal  Creatinine, GFR – normal  Electrolytes – normal.     She has just had a DDD type pacemaker implanted, however, the cause of sinus node dysfunction remains unknown. She claims that her sister has had some episodes of fainting after pregnancy however she did not attend any visits to doctors and the symptoms resoled on themselves.     What can be the causes of this conduction abnormality?  What can be the impact of ribavirinum and interferonum on heart conduction?  Can hepatitis C have direct effect on heart conduction?  What influence could normal pregnancy and delivery make on heart conduction?  Can there be any hereditary conditions here?     Looking forward for ideas.

Some of the things I have run across - 1) In younger patients I have seen the SSA/SSB issue when related to a positive ANA.  2) at any age a cardiac cath could show something that was unexpected. (yet I see in this case your good success of solving the medical problem).

c8cce8454bb90d0227b9d20b03fba66a87b77db1	Young patient (29) with heavy symptoms after holidays	http://www.doccheck.com/com/ask/question/view/id/592759/	19.10.2015	Andreas Rheinländer	Student of human medicine	female, Smoker: No    female, 29, nonsmoking       No permanent medication.     At the age of 14, she gets a high colonoscopy because of suspected chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD). There are no findings, just tiny isolated bondings in the Colon transversum.     At the age of 17, the patient gets a mononucleosis which she recovers from 4 weeks later.     A car accident at the age of 27 on a parking lodge causes injuries on her right hip, caused by a car slowly approaching and hitting her. She has a few hematomas, apart from that she has no serious injuries. Weeks after the accident the patient still feels pain in the area of the affected hip.          The woman worked as a nurse for one year. She worked about 50 hours a week and was self-employed (home care services).     She explains to take care about a healthy lifestyle and nutrition, living on a vegan or sometimes vegetarian diet. The 29-year-old states to feel more vital since living that way of life.     To keep in balance she decides to go on holiday. Her trip goes to South-East Asia for several weeks in summer.          At the beginning of her journey, she suffers from severe diarrhoea. The patient takes medication with her (Perenterol forte and Imodium) in advance. After about one week the diarrhoea disappears.     She visits an english-speaking physician in a small town who asks her about her daily nutrition. During their conversation, it soon becomes clear that she is likely to try different kinds of exotic fruits, nuts and plants. Many of these could have had ingredients she didn’t tolerate in the beginning. After about three weeks everything is alright again. Her intestinal system has adapted to the new circumstances and food. Every now and then she feels a little bit sick and unwell concerning her gastro-intestinal system.     On a group trip through the jungle the patient gets injured heavily. She falls around ten metres down, trying to cross a canyon. The young woman sustains open wounds and falls into open waters. During the first days in a hospital, her wounds get infected. This is cured quickly. After three weeks she can leave the clinic. To make full use of her holidays properly, she decides to stay in South-East Asia.     The last day of her journey she starts to feel unwell, on her flight back the woman suffers from fever and chills.  Back home she visits the next emergency clinic and explains everything about her trip around Asia and the events taking place there.  The physician asks for a case conference at the tropical institute. The young woman is suspected to have an infection of tropical pathogens. They initiate to take blood samples and treat her as an inpatient.     Some hours after the hospitalization the woman feels extreme pain in her lower abdomen. Her fever increases to 43 °C, consequently she dies.     The diagnosis is confirmed postmortem.     What do you think? What is the cause of death? And why do you think so?  Which parts of the anamnestic facts can lead to another suspected diagnosis and why?

Reason: slight abdominal pain, vomited one time, since 3 days no bowel movement.  X-ray abdomen findings by the radiologist (see photo): a few small intestinal air fluid levels, not a typical ileum, fecal impaction.  On the following day the patient came to us for a laparotomy followed by a CT of the abdomen due to an increase of the pain and nausea.     Now the following questions came up from the CT images below:       1. What happened to the small intestine? What is the cause of the vomiting?  2. Where do you see the colon?  3. Is there a serious finding in the liver or is this irrelevant?     The situs can also be found in the pictures.     Certainly not a difficult question, but a surgeon's everyday life…

After fever attack postoperatively, small multiple nodule developed in both calf skin with edema. And it was growing continuously and became larger and larger, hypertrophied and covered whole calf skin, warty like growth, and became thicker skin about 2 cm in thickness and have deep wrinkle with foul odour. He also suffered from peroidic fever attack with pain 2 or 3 times per year and keloidal tissue on both calf became severe by time. He was treated by intralesional steroid injection to hypertrophied skin however it had temporary effect, He was taught to compression of that by wrapping bandages continuously.  The mass is developed another area by time as like as satellite metastasis, recently the keloidal mass is newly formed on great toe.  When he visit my clinic, he is suffering from blood mixed lymph leakage on right posterior calf.  I did blood test and thyroid function test are all within normal limit. He is taking thyroid hormone relpacement therapy.    Ultrasonogram showed hypervascularity on both calf under the keloidal tissue and can see lymph fluid collection.    Chest PA showed small atelectasis on left lower lung field.  EKG showed sinus arrythmia.  In his medical history, He lives in Korea and never went to the tropical area.  He developed keloidal tissue on the leg after throidectomy 4 years ago.   CT showed hypertorphied skin and vascularity on both calf area.  I did excisional biopsy, during excision, surgical findings are heavy hypertrophied keloidal tissue. The base of Keloidal tissue is easy bleeding. I suture that scar with difficulty as it is too hard to suture.  I am waiting the answer of biopsy till now.  The keloidal scar on shoulder and neck is come from operation.  I think this is a keloid, no problem to make diagnosis.  Does anyone have experience with a case like this?

Please help me with this case (that is me): 36 ys old, woman, otherwise healthy. Allergy to NSAID.  For the last 6 months every time I breath cold air I get pain in my face (in correspondence of the paranasal sinuses), the pain at the beginning was lasting only for about half an hour, but every episode was worse than the previous and lately every time I breath cold air (even if it is not so cold at the beginning) I get pain in my face at least for 24-36 hours! Other than the pain I have my nose closed and some mucus that goes down in to my throath.  I had a fibroscophy and a CT, both of them have found inferior turbinate hypertrophy and deviation of the septum.  The ENT gave me corticosteroid nasal spray for 1 month + corticosteroid and mucolithic for 10 days a month by aerosol.  Do you have any suggestion about diagnosis and therapy?  Acute relapsing sinusitis? Hypersensitivity to cold?  Thanks

Dr. Gani Atilla Sengor	Physician	In acute rhinosinusitis we always prefer antibiotics with decongestant therapy. Endoscopic sinus surgery should be saved only for chronic or recurrent sinusitis. In our routin endoscopic examination, it is possible to observe all the anatomical or functional problems in the nose. The success of the sinus surgery is dependent to prior operation plan with a CT scan, to the hands and experience of the surgeon and to a good posteoperative follow up. Except chronic nasal polyposis disease, the recurrence is not common.

Amantadine can be helpful in the early stages as is LD, but not when freezing is (as usually) combined with end of dose effects. In this case the best option is Apomorphine sc in a dose that will be titrated according to the needs of patients.

In experiments conducted on mice, the UTMB researchers found that removing gastrin production triggered obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic changes that - in turn - increased the risk of colon cancer in the animals. The discoveries likely will have wide implications for clinical research on obesity, colon cancer and metabolism.

The Inhibition of P450 (CYP) activity via PPI can increase the estrogen value. That in turn can lead to weight changes and gynecomastia.

Perhaps it is simply that in some people a reduction in the frequency/severity of the symptoms of GORD (esp those such as dysphagia) allow them to once more enjoy/consume more food than when previously suffering with the symptoms? It is we known that symptoms of GORD are often worse after eating and as a number of patients have told me I, this is sometimes enough to put them off the act of eating altogether. Just a thought.

The second trimester seems to be the best time to take a plane because the nausea of most women will be behind them and the chances of miscarriage are low. However, pregnant women shouldn’t travel after 36 weeks.

Has the patient been vaccinated against rubella? It might also be mononcelosis. Is there splenomegaly (favours EBV). In any case if patient is stable without other signs of alarm (conscious, no meningeal signs, no purpura, no vomiting) I would just keep control of fever, nutrition according to tolerance, increased fluids. Fever should go down after appearance of the rash.

Unless desaturation is observed under CPAP then the desaturation could not be attributed to opiod central depressant effect.

For long term results, the jury is still out.  Surgery is performed through an anterior approach;  many descriptions online.  Degenerative disc per se is not a good surgical indication.  Pts. need a specific structural issue to benefit from surgery:  the classic indications are herniated disc or stenosis causing nerve pain, or spondylolisthesis causing back pain or stenosis or both.

I did a consultation as trainee in psychotherapy to an African patient who told me that he has vitiligo and he used some kind of ultraviolet therapy to heal one year ago and now he doesn't need any other therapy.  First of all I was wondering what kind of therapy is that and how it works and if the problem can come back.  And also I would like to know if, according to you, there can be a chance that this illness can be related with the fact that this African patient was verbally abused for being black for all his life.

Please check "patient history" below before proceeding.          After spending the night partying, the patient got picked up by paramedics. At the time, her blood alcohol concentration was 2.9. A medical examination subsequent to her arrival in a nearby hospital showed mild neurological disfunctions in the form of ataxia. The attending doctor arranged for a 2 day stay to monitor her condition.     Initially, she received infusions to compensate for the loss of fluids and electrolytes. However, the patient insisted on having solid food. After careful consideration the attending physician granted that request.  The patient expressed that she did not have a good meal in days. Due to that, she consumed considerable amounts of food, especially desserts, vegetables and defatted meat.     Shortly before she was supposed to be discharged, the neurological symptoms returned. The attending physician mandated her to stay another 3 days. During the third day, the patient overinduldged. As a result, she suffered from severe diarrhoe. She stated not to eat so much, normally.     A short time later, the neurological symptoms disappeared. The patient was discharged and given a specialist referral (neurology).     Another two days later, the neurological symptoms reappeared. The patient also felt fatigued and exhausted. From time to time, her hands showed signs of a tremor. The patient thought that this would be the result of her night partying as well as her abidance at the hospital.     To recuperate, she decided to pay a visit to an acquaintance. During her stay there, she mostly consumed mediterranean food like steamed red meat, seafood and cheese. Her condition improved.     A few days later, her condition changed for the worse.  One week later, the patient collapses whilst taking a walk.     The clinical pictured looked as follows:  Clear indication of a progressing hepatitis and haemolytic anaemia.  The neurological symptoms greatly increased in intensitity and were similar to those of Parkinson's Disease.  The patient was described as restless, suffered from changing moods and a mild clinical depression.     The diagnosis was made about a week later by the attending physician who treated her during her first stay at the hospital.     Hint: the diagnosis is not food intolerance (or food allergy) or viral hepatitis.

COPD with home O2 supply, several episodes of severe chest pain, heart catheterisation, which showed 0% stenosis was made one year ago.   EF of 65%, art.hypertonia.  The shortness of breath is typical in her COPD exacerabations.  The patient is a member of the so called "50-50 club", which means that both her PaCO2 and PaO2 are in the range of 50 mm Hg.    She has difficulties in breathing and is only able to talk in small sentences.  On physical examination, she is using accessory muscles for breathing, she is tachycardic at 125 bpm.  She has never been intubated before.  SpO2 is 94% on 3L O2. Her home O2 is 2L/min.  After one shot albuterol, her HR increased to 189 bpm, her BP is 150/90.  The monitor shows a narrow complex tachycardia, she is still fully orientated. A 12-lead ECG confirms the diagnosis of a narrow complex tachycardia.      SVT in response to albuterol?  What would you do next?     Thanks a lot

A 47 year old man who is a heavy smoker, hospitalized because of back pains and advanced pedal edema. 5 years earlier he had acute MI, was catheterized and 2 stents were inserted.  Blood pressure was mildly high and his blood chemistry in this admission showed Cr – 0.8 mg/dl, Albumin 3 dg/dl and slight cholesterol elevation. Immunological tests revealed no Lupus, no Rheumatoid arthritis and no vasculitis (ANCA – negative). Urinalysis showed proteinuria and micro hematuria with rare granular casts. 24 h urinary protein was 13 grams. He was treated with forced diuresis and a kidney biopsy was preformed (attached) which showed MGN. We did not send a sample for anti LPA receptor Ab. We decided to initiated the Ponticelli protocol of Methyl Prednisolone 1 gram/day for 3 days followed PO Prednisone 40 mg/day for 27 days to be followed with CTX for the next month.  After 2 weeks he developed pneumonia with edema & anuria and Cr rose to 4.6 (somewhere else prescribed him Aldacton and we stopped it) together with high BP. Antibiotic and diuresis with IV Albumin & reduced steroids for few days restored the clinical findings to basic.  His treatment consisted of:     On the 2nd month for some reason his health provider preferred to provide Chloram  Bucil rather than CTX, we adapted it and gave him 8 mg twice a day together with 20 mg of prednisone. We repeated this alternate month treatment for 6 month with no benefit (except for incidental result of 4 grams/day of U protein that did not repeat itself) in terms of proteinuria which remained in 11–16 grams/day. In addition he developed small joints, muscles & bone pains. He got for that Fossalan with no real subjective improvement.  After 6 months we remained with 30 mg/day of prednisone but the proteinuria remained high and we decided to treat him with Cyclosporine 120 mg x2/day + Prednisone 30 mg/d.  He got this treatment for 4-5 months without any improvement but with increasing pains and we reduced the to Cyclosporine75 mg x2/d + Prednisone 30 mg/d. Again after additional 5 months no improvement but with advanced pains (he was considered to have osteoporosis and some obscure small joints that the Rheumatologist concluded as non-specific without certain treatment but again RF, ANA, ANCA etc. were negative & C3, C4 - normal).  With some despair we started IM Synacthen1 mg x2/week. Now after 2 months we see 16 grams/day U proteins severe bone, muscles & small joints pains.  In this point we a bit helpless and ask your advice.  Thank you for your help,  Zvi Barnea, Nephrology, Wolfson Hospital

NOwadays the diets with less of 0.75 gr/protein/day are avoided becasue of the risk of malnutrition. You can bring a diet with 0.8-1  gr / kg /protein / day. Phosporous, sodium are resticted (800-1000 mg for P, and less than 2400 mg for sodium) Potassium doesnt need a restriction in early stages, it is only restricted if the diureses is less that a 1000/day or if it is high in the labs. Phosphorus can be found in dairy products, meat, eggs, sardine, tuna, fish...

Most likely with Renal pt the diet modifications are fluid restriction (depend in u/o), sodium restriction (depend on the stage and olerance), K -depend on the pt tolerance or stage, protein -it is recommended a low protein diet on pt that are not receiving any dialysis treatment and phosphate - tighter restriction recommended on pt with no dialysis treatment.

The values of 1,6 and 1,8 depending of the institution that promotes the guidelines, but are adopted to specif pathologies as VIH (1,5 a 2g/kg) and others.

In case of no support like these and a severe renal injury it should be about 0.6g/kg.
91916d5a545bc3b9f9230a6dabac9f1cbede61f7	I need a diet for Renal Insuffiency would you help me please?	http://www.doccheck.com/com/ask/question/view/id/590223/	17.04.2013	sílvia pinhao	Assistant dietician	For renal insuffiency, you need to avoid all of the rich potassium foods (potato, some fruits) to cut and peel vegetables, place in water 24H, cook in a first water that will be rejected and use only the second water of cooking. Reduce the intake of protein foods (just one meal a day could have meat or fish), drink a lot of water... but in fact any patient is a patient so the best for the tratment is an individualized plan, calculate with 0,8g protein/kg/day, 30-35% lipids and the rest of carbs.

Pregabalin can be given to her safely. Start with a dose of 75 mg Bid and may be increased gradually to 150 mg bid. Drowsiness as a side effect must be kept in mind.

Parmar	Physician	Morphine and its metabolites accumulate in kidney failure and is not the best choice. Hydromorphone and fentanyl are options to consider and dose adjusted. However, fentanyl in patch form may cause problems as well and should not be used in an opioid-naive patient.

It is awesome to have access to the combined experience of all you experienced clinicians on this platform!  So, I have a 58 yo female patient with a 4+ year history of low TIBC, and high %Sat with normal Serum Fe, normal Ferritin, normal CBC. (Recent abnormal labs TIBC 129 H, %Sat 58 L, total Chol 227 H, LDL 138 H; Serum Fe, Ferritin, CBC, Chem panel WNL). These ab normal labs have not been addressed by her PCP over the years, just monitored.

Can he use another antibiotic?

Jörg Köster	Physician	I have recently shared this case with the German speaking users in the DocCheck Community, but thought I should share this with the the English speaking users as well.  Recently a patient in his mid-forties came into my practice complaining of neck pain. He had had a seizure and fallen on New Year's Eve (no, he had not consumed any alcohol!). Patient has epilepsy and has had ankylosing spondylitis for many years.  Since New Year's Eve he had strong neck pain with limited ability to move and mild C7 paresthesias. The patient tried self-medication with diclofenac which was only moderately effective and said that the pre-existing inclination of his head/neck had increased.  The X-ray which was taken (please apologize the poor quality - I took this picture with my mobile phone) - provided this finding. What can you say? It never gets boring in a GP's practice…

Hb value is at 6 g/dl (even though patient eats balanced meals). Symptoms are numbness in extremities, head and back, fatigue, poor endurance, rhagades at the corners of her mouth.  As a first step I asked her to keep a diary about her meals and eating habits and took regular blood samples. She tried iron in the form of capsules and tablets but doesn't tolerate them. Now she takes 2 fizzy tablets a day which works well as far as tolerance and Hb value are concerned. However, do you have any alternative ideas how to keep Hb value at a normal level?

Cotton buds made it even worse in a way that the treated ulcer got even bigger.  What would you do in a next step? Any suggestions with what it could correlate or how to treat it?

Now I came across a case that I'd like to describe you to find out about your general experience on this topic.    A 23-year-old (BMI 15.8) patient shows the classic symptoms of bulimia nervosa: binge eating 5-8 times a week, self-induced vomitting, appetite suppressants, working out a lot, missing of menstruation,  disorder of hunger and satiety feeling, and so on.  She's been bulimic for 2 years now. Tried a therapy 10 months ago where she learnt how to eat regularly again as a first step, then cue exposure treatment. As a further step, she worked on her strict assessment of fat and slim. Although therapy made her gain some weight and stopped her from vomitting for a while, it didn't last long. Now she's back to being bulimic. Probly triggered by being made redundant 2 months ago.     Now, I wondered whether you would also think about medical treatment? What is your experience with bulimia and the different treatments?  Thank you for your input.  Sincerely,

The UV-RADIATION of the sun is not dangerous for the unborn. Animal experimentally teratogene effects could be proven. During the pregnancy the maternal  skin is more sensitive and more susceptible to a sun fire. Admits is an association between Solarium and Pseudoporphyrie. In the literature no drop control studies could be found.

When a medication or treatment is a life-saving one -typical case of blood transfusion for sons of Jehovah's witnesses-, the pediatrist can ask the judge to remove the parents' legal power, so a guardian is appointed for saving the child and then the power given back to the parents.

Often it is "idiopatic". Since the nerve fibres for the sweat glands are travelling with the arm vessles from the stellate ganglion, a lesion/irritation somewhere in the course of the fibres could cause the symptoms. The region of the stellate ganglion could be checked with MRT. Focal hyperhydrosis is treated with Botox.
